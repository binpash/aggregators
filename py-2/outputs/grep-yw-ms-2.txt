inputs/yw-2.txt:They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns
inputs/yw-2.txt:them upside-down, and makes their eyes white!
inputs/yw-2.txt:It is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most
inputs/yw-2.txt:I see her on that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in
inputs/yw-2.txt:I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a

inputs/yw-2.txt:He asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very
inputs/yw-2.txt:loving and kind.
inputs/yw-2.txt:It only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly
inputs/yw-2.txt:over night, and won’t be out until this evening.
inputs/yw-2.txt:moonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I
inputs/yw-2.txt:got up and ran to help her.
inputs/yw-2.txt:I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we
inputs/yw-2.txt:A strip about as high as my head and half around the room.
inputs/yw-2.txt:And then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me
inputs/yw-2.txt:We go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again
inputs/yw-2.txt:She laughed and said she wouldn’t mind doing it herself, but I must not

inputs/yw-2.txt:was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down
inputs/yw-2.txt:again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner—I would
inputs/yw-2.txt:So now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone,
inputs/yw-2.txt:and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the
inputs/yw-2.txt:We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.
inputs/yw-2.txt:I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.
inputs/yw-2.txt:I don’t want to go out, and I don’t want to have anybody come in, till
inputs/yw-2.txt:does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!
inputs/yw-2.txt:But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!
inputs/yw-2.txt:I tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I
inputs/yw-2.txt:Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It
inputs/yw-2.txt:sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled
inputs/yw-2.txt:heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with
inputs/yw-2.txt:like that is improper and might be misconstrued.
inputs/yw-2.txt:creeping women, and they creep so fast.
inputs/yw-2.txt:night, and that is hard!
inputs/yw-2.txt:It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I
inputs/yw-2.txt:For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green
inputs/yw-2.txt:But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits
inputs/yw-2.txt:How he does call and pound!
inputs/yw-2.txt:And then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and
inputs/yw-2.txt:said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course,
inputs/yw-2.txt:and came in. He stopped short by the door.

inputs/ms-2.txt:Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and
inputs/ms-2.txt:vigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great

inputs/ms-2.txt:hand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she
inputs/ms-2.txt:She flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a
inputs/ms-2.txt:plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.
inputs/ms-2.txt:She jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that
inputs/ms-2.txt:her position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she
inputs/ms-2.txt:is saved and sent away in sacks.”
inputs/ms-2.txt:I expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the
inputs/ms-2.txt:broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different
inputs/ms-2.txt:wings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out
inputs/ms-2.txt:John left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking

inputs/ms-2.txt:“Yes; you see she went to the mater, and—Oh,—here’s Evie herself.”

inputs/ms-2.txt:years younger than you, and don’t you fool yourself as to what he

inputs/ms-2.txt:rose and moved to the door. John’s voice sounded outside. With her hand
inputs/ms-2.txt:on the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to
