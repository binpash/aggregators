inputs/yw.txt:most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
inputs/yw.txt:It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure
inputs/yw.txt:and reach the height of romantic felicity—but that would be asking too
inputs/yw.txt:intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of
inputs/yw.txt:things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.
inputs/yw.txt:John is a physician, and perhaps—(I would not say it to a living soul,
inputs/yw.txt:of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my
inputs/yw.txt:If a physician of high standing, and one’s own husband, assures friends
inputs/yw.txt:and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but
inputs/yw.txt:My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says
inputs/yw.txt:So I take phosphates or phosphites—whichever it is, and tonics, and
inputs/yw.txt:journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to “work”
inputs/yw.txt:Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change,
inputs/yw.txt:I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and
inputs/yw.txt:more society and stimulus—but John says the very worst thing I can do
inputs/yw.txt:is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel
inputs/yw.txt:So I will let it alone and talk about the house.
inputs/yw.txt:The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from
inputs/yw.txt:English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and
inputs/yw.txt:gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners
inputs/yw.txt:and people.
inputs/yw.txt:There is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden—large and shady,
inputs/yw.txt:full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors

inputs/yw.txt:was a draught, and shut the window.

inputs/yw.txt:piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned
inputs/yw.txt:He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no
inputs/yw.txt:He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special
inputs/yw.txt:care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.
inputs/yw.txt:rest and all the air I could get. “Your exercise depends on your
inputs/yw.txt:strength, my dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat on your appetite;
inputs/yw.txt:all ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then
inputs/yw.txt:playground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred
inputs/yw.txt:for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.
inputs/yw.txt:The paint and paper look as if a boys’ school had used it. It is
inputs/yw.txt:about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of

inputs/yw.txt:There comes John, and I must put this away,—he hates to have me write a

inputs/yw.txt:reason to suffer, and that satisfies him.
inputs/yw.txt:I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and
inputs/yw.txt:able—to dress and entertain, and order things.
inputs/yw.txt:was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a
inputs/yw.txt:bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head
inputs/yw.txt:of the stairs, and so on.
inputs/yw.txt:“You know the place is doing you good,” he said, “and really, dear, I
inputs/yw.txt:Then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and
inputs/yw.txt:said he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into
inputs/yw.txt:But he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.
inputs/yw.txt:It is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of
inputs/yw.txt:arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.
inputs/yw.txt:Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private
inputs/yw.txt:these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give
inputs/yw.txt:way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and
inputs/yw.txt:all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good
inputs/yw.txt:would relieve the press of ideas and rest me.
inputs/yw.txt:It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my
inputs/yw.txt:work. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and
inputs/yw.txt:and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.
inputs/yw.txt:I get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the
inputs/yw.txt:everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,
inputs/yw.txt:didn’t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little
inputs/yw.txt:I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all
inputs/yw.txt:know how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and
inputs/yw.txt:get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain
inputs/yw.txt:have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.
inputs/yw.txt:could always hop into that chair and be safe.
inputs/yw.txt:a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I
inputs/yw.txt:The wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh
inputs/yw.txt:Then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster
inputs/yw.txt:itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is
inputs/yw.txt:There comes John’s sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful
inputs/yw.txt:She is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better
inputs/yw.txt:But I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these
inputs/yw.txt:There is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road,
inputs/yw.txt:and one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too,
inputs/yw.txt:full of great elms and velvet meadows.
inputs/yw.txt:and not clearly then.
inputs/yw.txt:But in the places where it isn’t faded, and where the sun is just so, I
inputs/yw.txt:sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.
inputs/yw.txt:Well, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired

inputs/yw.txt:I don’t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for
inputs/yw.txt:anything, and I’m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.

inputs/yw.txt:serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.
inputs/yw.txt:porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.
inputs/yw.txt:I lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and
inputs/yw.txt:there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth
inputs/yw.txt:I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was
inputs/yw.txt:Looked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and
inputs/yw.txt:waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.
inputs/yw.txt:But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling
inputs/yw.txt:The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I
inputs/yw.txt:They have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds
inputs/yw.txt:There is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when
inputs/yw.txt:the cross-lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can
inputs/yw.txt:form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal
inputs/yw.txt:And I know John would think it absurd. But I must say what I feel and
inputs/yw.txt:Half the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.
inputs/yw.txt:John says I musn’t lose my strength, and has me take cod-liver oil and
inputs/yw.txt:lots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare
inputs/yw.txt:Dear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried
inputs/yw.txt:to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell
inputs/yw.txt:him how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and
inputs/yw.txt:But he said I wasn’t able to go, nor able to stand it after I got
inputs/yw.txt:there; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was
inputs/yw.txt:And dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs
inputs/yw.txt:and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my

inputs/yw.txt:must take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.
inputs/yw.txt:will and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.
inputs/yw.txt:There’s one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to
inputs/yw.txt:after all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.
inputs/yw.txt:And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that
inputs/yw.txt:and because he loves me so.
inputs/yw.txt:I hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by
inputs/yw.txt:John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched
inputs/yw.txt:I got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and
inputs/yw.txt:not gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.
inputs/yw.txt:“Why darling!” said he, “our lease will be up in three weeks, and I
inputs/yw.txt:“The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town
inputs/yw.txt:just now. Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but

inputs/yw.txt:sleep, and talk about it in the morning!”
inputs/yw.txt:“Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will
inputs/yw.txt:“Better in body perhaps”—I began, and stopped short, for he sat up
inputs/yw.txt:straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I
inputs/yw.txt:“My darling,” said he, “I beg of you, for my sake and for our child’s
inputs/yw.txt:fascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish
inputs/yw.txt:So of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before
inputs/yw.txt:hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern
inputs/yw.txt:The color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating
inputs/yw.txt:following, it turns a back somersault and there you are. It slaps you
inputs/yw.txt:in the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad
inputs/yw.txt:toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,—why, that is
inputs/yw.txt:to notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.
inputs/yw.txt:At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and
inputs/yw.txt:and the woman behind it is as plain as can be.
inputs/yw.txt:I lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep
inputs/yw.txt:He seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable
inputs/yw.txt:I have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into
inputs/yw.txt:the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I’ve caught him
inputs/yw.txt:with her hand on it once.
inputs/yw.txt:She didn’t know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a
inputs/yw.txt:stealing, and looked quite angry—asked me why I should frighten her so!
inputs/yw.txt:had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John’s, and she wished
inputs/yw.txt:and I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!
inputs/yw.txt:better, and am more quiet than I was.
inputs/yw.txt:day, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper.
inputs/yw.txt:more, and I think that will be enough.
inputs/yw.txt:In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.
inputs/yw.txt:There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all
inputs/yw.txt:the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was
inputs/yw.txt:not bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the
inputs/yw.txt:Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise
inputs/yw.txt:It is not bad—at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most
inputs/yw.txt:In this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it
inputs/yw.txt:been rubbed over and over.
inputs/yw.txt:I wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for.
inputs/yw.txt:Round and round and round—round and round and round—it makes me dizzy!
inputs/yw.txt:The front pattern does move—and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!
inputs/yw.txt:Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes
inputs/yw.txt:only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all
inputs/yw.txt:Then in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady
inputs/yw.txt:spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.
inputs/yw.txt:They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns
inputs/yw.txt:them upside-down, and makes their eyes white!
inputs/yw.txt:It is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most
inputs/yw.txt:I see her on that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in
inputs/yw.txt:I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a
inputs/yw.txt:There are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John
inputs/yw.txt:He asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very
inputs/yw.txt:loving and kind.
inputs/yw.txt:It only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly
inputs/yw.txt:over night, and won’t be out until this evening.
inputs/yw.txt:moonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I
inputs/yw.txt:got up and ran to help her.
inputs/yw.txt:I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we
inputs/yw.txt:A strip about as high as my head and half around the room.
inputs/yw.txt:And then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me
inputs/yw.txt:We go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again
inputs/yw.txt:She laughed and said she wouldn’t mind doing it herself, but I must not
inputs/yw.txt:But I am here, and no person touches this paper but me—not alive!
inputs/yw.txt:was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down
inputs/yw.txt:again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner—I would
inputs/yw.txt:So now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone,
inputs/yw.txt:and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the
inputs/yw.txt:We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.
inputs/yw.txt:I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.
inputs/yw.txt:I don’t want to go out, and I don’t want to have anybody come in, till
inputs/yw.txt:does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!
inputs/yw.txt:But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!
inputs/yw.txt:I tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I
inputs/yw.txt:Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It
inputs/yw.txt:sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled
inputs/yw.txt:heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with
inputs/yw.txt:like that is improper and might be misconstrued.
inputs/yw.txt:creeping women, and they creep so fast.
inputs/yw.txt:night, and that is hard!
inputs/yw.txt:It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I
inputs/yw.txt:For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green
inputs/yw.txt:But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits
inputs/yw.txt:How he does call and pound!
inputs/yw.txt:And then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and
inputs/yw.txt:said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course,
inputs/yw.txt:and came in. He stopped short by the door.
inputs/yw.txt:“I’ve got out at last,” said I, “in spite of you and Jane! And I’ve

inputs/ms.txt:Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and

inputs/ms.txt:hand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she

inputs/ms.txt:She jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that
