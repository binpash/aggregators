men
who
were
woodcutting
and
allowing
the
french
to
pass
him
had
made
a
bayonet
charge
with
two
battalions
and
had
broken
up
the
french
troops
when
i
saw
your
excellency
that
their
first
battalion
was
disorganized
i
stopped
in
the
road
and
thought
i
ll
let
them
come
on
and
will
meet
them
with
the
fire
of
the
whole
battalion
and
that
s
what
i
did
the
general
had
so
wished
to
do
this
and
was
so
sorry
he
had
not
managed
to
do
it
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
had
really
happened
perhaps
it
might
really
have
been
so
could
one
possibly
make
out
amid
all
that
confusion
what
did
or
did
not
happen
by
the
way
your
excellency
i
should
inform
you
he
continued
remembering
dolokhov
s
conversation
with
kutuzov
and
his
last
interview
with
the
gentleman
ranker
that
private
dolokhov
who
was
reduced
to
the
ranks
took
a
french
officer
prisoner
in
my
presence
and
particularly
distinguished
himself
i
saw
the
pavlograd
hussars
attack
there
your
excellency
chimed
in
zherkov
looking
uneasily
around
he
had
not
seen
the
hussars
all
that
day
but
had
heard
about
them
from
an
infantry
officer
they
broke
up
two
squares
your
excellency
several
of
those
present
smiled
at
zherkov
s
words
expecting
one
of
his
usual
jokes
but
noticing
that
what
he
was
saying
redounded
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
of
the
day
s
work
they
assumed
a
serious
expression
though
many
of
them
knew
that
what
he
was
saying
was
a
lie
devoid
of
any
foundation
prince
bagration
turned
to
the
old
colonel
gentlemen
i
thank
you
all
all
arms
have
behaved
heroically
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
how
was
it
that
two
guns
were
abandoned
in
the
center
he
inquired
searching
with
his
eyes
for
someone
prince
bagration
did
not
ask
about
the
guns
on
the
left
flank
he
knew
that
all
the
guns
there
had
been
abandoned
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
action
i
think
i
sent
you
he
added
turning
to
the
staff
officer
on
duty
one
was
damaged
answered
the
staff
officer
and
the
other
i
can
t
understand
i
was
there
all
the
time
giving
orders
and
had
only
just
left
it
is
true
that
it
was
hot
there
he
added
modestly
someone
mentioned
that
captain
tushin
was
bivouacking
close
to
the
village
and
had
already
been
sent
for
oh
but
you
were
there
said
prince
bagration
addressing
prince
andrew
of
course
we
only
just
missed
one
another
said
the
staff
officer
with
a
smile
to
bolkonski
i
had
not
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
said
prince
andrew
coldly
and
abruptly
all
were
silent
tushin
appeared
at
the
threshold
and
made
his
way
timidly
from
behind
the
backs
of
the
generals
as
he
stepped
past
the
generals
in
the
crowded
hut
feeling
embarrassed
as
he
always
was
by
the
sight
of
his
superiors
he
did
not
notice
the
staff
of
the
banner
and
stumbled
over
it
several
of
those
present
laughed
how
was
it
a
gun
was
abandoned
asked
bagration
frowning
not
so
much
at
the
captain
as
at
those
who
were
laughing
among
whom
zherkov
laughed
loudest
only
now
when
he
was
confronted
by
the
stern
authorities
did
his
guilt
and
the
disgrace
of
having
lost
two
guns
and
yet
remaining
alive
present
themselves
to
tushin
in
all
their
horror
he
had
been
so
excited
that
he
had
not
thought
about
it
until
that
moment
the
officers
laughter
confused
him
still
more
he
stood
before
bagration
with
his
lower
jaw
trembling
and
was
hardly
able
to
mutter
i
don
t
know
your
excellency
i
had
no
men
your
excellency
you
might
have
taken
some
from
the
covering
troops
tushin
did
not
say
that
there
were
no
covering
troops
though
that
was
perfectly
true
he
was
afraid
of
getting
some
other
officer
into
trouble
and
silently
fixed
his
eyes
on
bagration
as
a
schoolboy
who
has
blundered
looks
at
an
examiner
the
silence
lasted
some
time
prince
bagration
apparently
not
wishing
to
be
severe
found
nothing
to
say
the
others
did
not
venture
to
intervene
prince
andrew
looked
at
tushin
from
under
his
brows
and
his
fingers
twitched
nervously
your
excellency
prince
andrew
broke
the
silence
with
his
abrupt
voice
you
were
pleased
to
send
me
to
captain
tushin
s
battery
i
went
there
and
found
two
thirds
of
the
men
and
horses
knocked
out
two
guns
smashed
and
no
supports
at
all
prince
bagration
and
tushin
looked
with
equal
intentness
at
bolkonski
who
spoke
with
suppressed
agitation
and
if
your
excellency
will
allow
me
to
express
my
opinion
he
continued
we
owe
today
s
success
chiefly
to
the
action
of
that
battery
and
the
heroic
endurance
of
captain
tushin
and
his
company
and
without
awaiting
a
reply
prince
andrew
rose
and
left
the
table
prince
bagration
looked
at
tushin
evidently
reluctant
to
show
distrust
in
bolkonski
s
emphatic
opinion
yet
not
feeling
able
fully
to
credit
it
bent
his
head
and
told
tushin
that
he
could
go
prince
andrew
went
out
with
him
thank
you
you
saved
me
my
dear
fellow
said
tushin
prince
andrew
gave
him
a
look
but
said
nothing
and
went
away
he
felt
sad
and
depressed
it
was
all
so
strange
so
unlike
what
he
had
hoped
who
are
they
why
are
they
here
what
do
they
want
and
when
will
all
this
end
thought
rostov
looking
at
the
changing
shadows
before
him
the
pain
in
his
arm
became
more
and
more
intense
irresistible
drowsiness
overpowered
him
red
rings
danced
before
his
eyes
and
the
impression
of
those
voices
and
faces
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
merged
with
the
physical
pain
it
was
they
these
soldiers
wounded
and
unwounded
it
was
they
who
were
crushing
weighing
down
and
twisting
the
sinews
and
scorching
the
flesh
of
his
sprained
arm
and
shoulder
to
rid
himself
of
them
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
dozed
but
in
that
short
interval
innumerable
things
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
his
mother
and
her
large
white
hand
sonya
s
thin
little
shoulders
natasha
s
eyes
and
laughter
denisov
with
his
voice
and
mustache
and
telyanin
and
all
that
affair
with
telyanin
and
bogdanich
that
affair
was
the
same
thing
as
this
soldier
with
the
harsh
voice
and
it
was
that
affair
and
this
soldier
that
were
so
agonizingly
incessantly
pulling
and
pressing
his
arm
and
always
dragging
it
in
one
direction
he
tried
to
get
away
from
them
but
they
would
not
for
an
instant
let
his
shoulder
move
a
hair
s
breadth
it
would
not
ache
it
would
be
well
if
only
they
did
not
pull
it
but
it
was
impossible
to
get
rid
of
them
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
the
black
canopy
of
night
hung
less
than
a
yard
above
the
glow
of
the
charcoal
flakes
of
falling
snow
were
fluttering
in
that
light
tushin
had
not
returned
the
doctor
had
not
come
he
was
alone
now
except
for
a
soldier
who
was
sitting
naked
at
the
other
side
of
the
fire
warming
his
thin
yellow
body
nobody
wants
me
thought
rostov
there
is
no
one
to
help
me
or
pity
me
yet
i
was
once
at
home
strong
happy
and
loved
he
sighed
and
doing
so
groaned
involuntarily
eh
is
anything
hurting
you
asked
the
soldier
shaking
his
shirt
out
over
the
fire
and
not
waiting
for
an
answer
he
gave
a
grunt
and
added
what
a
lot
of
men
have
been
crippled
today
frightful
rostov
did
not
listen
to
the
soldier
he
looked
at
the
snowflakes
fluttering
above
the
fire
and
remembered
a
russian
winter
at
his
warm
bright
home
his
fluffy
fur
coat
his
quickly
gliding
sleigh
his
healthy
body
and
all
the
affection
and
care
of
his
family
and
why
did
i
come
here
he
wondered
next
day
the
french
army
did
not
renew
their
attack
and
the
remnant
of
bagration
s
detachment
was
reunited
to
kutuzov
s
army
book
three
chapter
i
prince
vasili
was
not
a
man
who
deliberately
thought
out
his
plans
still
less
did
he
think
of
injuring
anyone
for
his
own
advantage
he
was
merely
a
man
of
the
world
who
had
got
on
and
to
whom
getting
on
had
become
a
habit
schemes
and
devices
for
which
he
never
rightly
accounted
to
himself
but
which
formed
the
whole
interest
of
his
life
were
constantly
shaping
themselves
in
his
mind
arising
from
the
circumstances
and
persons
he
met
of
these
plans
he
had
not
merely
one
or
two
in
his
head
but
dozens
some
only
beginning
to
form
themselves
some
approaching
achievement
and
some
in
course
of
disintegration
he
did
not
for
instance
say
to
himself
this
man
now
has
influence
i
must
gain
his
confidence
and
friendship
and
through
him
obtain
a
special
grant
nor
did
he
say
to
himself
pierre
is
a
rich
man
i
must
entice
him
to
marry
my
daughter
and
lend
me
the
forty
thousand
rubles
i
need
but
when
he
came
across
a
man
of
position
his
instinct
immediately
told
him
that
this
man
could
be
useful
and
without
any
premeditation
prince
vasili
took
the
first
opportunity
to
gain
his
confidence
flatter
him
become
intimate
with
him
and
finally
make
his
request
he
had
pierre
at
hand
in
moscow
and
procured
for
him
an
appointment
as
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
which
at
that
time
conferred
the
status
of
councilor
of
state
and
insisted
on
the
young
man
accompanying
him
to
petersburg
and
staying
at
his
house
with
apparent
absent
mindedness
yet
with
unhesitating
assurance
that
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
prince
vasili
did
everything
to
get
pierre
to
marry
his
daughter
had
he
thought
out
his
plans
beforehand
he
could
not
have
been
so
natural
and
shown
such
unaffected
familiarity
in
intercourse
with
everybody
both
above
and
below
him
in
social
standing
something
always
drew
him
toward
those
richer
and
more
powerful
than
himself
and
he
had
rare
skill
in
seizing
the
most
opportune
moment
for
making
use
of
people
pierre
on
unexpectedly
becoming
count
bezukhov
and
a
rich
man
felt
himself
after
his
recent
loneliness
and
freedom
from
cares
so
beset
and
preoccupied
that
only
in
bed
was
he
able
to
be
by
himself
he
had
to
sign
papers
to
present
himself
at
government
offices
the
purpose
of
which
was
not
clear
to
him
to
question
his
chief
steward
to
visit
his
estate
near
moscow
and
to
receive
many
people
who
formerly
did
not
even
wish
to
know
of
his
existence
but
would
now
have
been
offended
and
grieved
had
he
chosen
not
to
see
them
these
different
people
businessmen
relations
and
acquaintances
alike
were
all
disposed
to
treat
the
young
heir
in
the
most
friendly
and
flattering
manner
they
were
all
evidently
firmly
convinced
of
pierre
s
noble
qualities
he
was
always
hearing
such
words
as
with
your
remarkable
kindness
or
with
your
excellent
heart
you
are
yourself
so
honorable
count
or
were
he
as
clever
as
you
and
so
on
till
he
began
sincerely
to
believe
in
his
own
exceptional
kindness
and
extraordinary
intelligence
the
more
so
as
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
it
had
always
seemed
to
him
that
he
really
was
very
kind
and
intelligent
even
people
who
had
formerly
been
spiteful
toward
him
and
evidently
unfriendly
now
became
gentle
and
affectionate
the
angry
eldest
princess
with
the
long
waist
and
hair
plastered
down
like
a
doll
s
had
come
into
pierre
s
room
after
the
funeral
with
drooping
eyes
and
frequent
blushes
she
told
him
she
was
very
sorry
about
their
past
misunderstandings
and
did
not
now
feel
she
had
a
right
to
ask
him
for
anything
except
only
for
permission
after
the
blow
she
had
received
to
remain
for
a
few
weeks
longer
in
the
house
she
so
loved
and
where
she
had
sacrificed
so
much
she
could
not
refrain
from
weeping
at
these
words
touched
that
this
statuesque
princess
could
so
change
pierre
took
her
hand
and
begged
her
forgiveness
without
knowing
what
for
from
that
day
the
eldest
princess
quite
changed
toward
pierre
and
began
knitting
a
striped
scarf
for
him
do
this
for
my
sake
mon
cher
after
all
she
had
to
put
up
with
a
great
deal
from
the
deceased
said
prince
vasili
to
him
handing
him
a
deed
to
sign
for
the
princess
benefit
prince
vasili
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
necessary
to
throw
this
bone
a
bill
for
thirty
thousand
rubles
to
the
poor
princess
that
it
might
not
occur
to
her
to
speak
of
his
share
in
the
affair
of
the
inlaid
portfolio
pierre
signed
the
deed
and
after
that
the
princess
grew
still
kinder
the
younger
sisters
also
became
affectionate
to
him
especially
the
youngest
the
pretty
one
with
the
mole
who
often
made
him
feel
confused
by
her
smiles
and
her
own
confusion
when
meeting
him
it
seemed
so
natural
to
pierre
that
everyone
should
like
him
and
it
would
have
seemed
so
unnatural
had
anyone
disliked
him
that
he
could
not
but
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
those
around
him
besides
he
had
no
time
to
ask
himself
whether
these
people
were
sincere
or
not
he
was
always
busy
and
always
felt
in
a
state
of
mild
and
cheerful
intoxication
he
felt
as
though
he
were
the
center
of
some
important
and
general
movement
that
something
was
constantly
expected
of
him
that
if
he
did
not
do
it
he
would
grieve
and
disappoint
many
people
but
if
he
did
this
and
that
all
would
be
well
and
he
did
what
was
demanded
of
him
but
still
that
happy
result
always
remained
in
the
future
more
than
anyone
else
prince
vasili
took
possession
of
pierre
s
affairs
and
of
pierre
himself
in
those
early
days
from
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
he
did
not
let
go
his
hold
of
the
lad
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
oppressed
by
business
weary
and
suffering
who
yet
would
not
for
pity
s
sake
leave
this
helpless
youth
who
after
all
was
the
son
of
his
old
friend
and
the
possessor
of
such
enormous
wealth
to
the
caprice
of
fate
and
the
designs
of
rogues
during
the
few
days
he
spent
in
moscow
after
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
he
would
call
pierre
or
go
to
him
himself
and
tell
him
what
ought
to
be
done
in
a
tone
of
weariness
and
assurance
as
if
he
were
adding
every
time
you
know
i
am
overwhelmed
with
business
and
it
is
purely
out
of
charity
that
i
trouble
myself
about
you
and
you
also
know
quite
well
that
what
i
propose
is
the
only
thing
possible
well
my
dear
fellow
tomorrow
we
are
off
at
last
said
prince
vasili
one
day
closing
his
eyes
and
fingering
pierre
s
elbow
speaking
as
if
he
were
saying
something
which
had
long
since
been
agreed
upon
and
could
not
now
be
altered
we
start
tomorrow
and
i
m
giving
you
a
place
in
my
carriage
i
am
very
glad
all
our
important
business
here
is
now
settled
and
i
ought
to
have
been
off
long
ago
here
is
something
i
have
received
from
the
chancellor
i
asked
him
for
you
and
you
have
been
entered
in
the
diplomatic
corps
and
made
a
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
the
diplomatic
career
now
lies
open
before
you
notwithstanding
the
tone
of
wearied
assurance
with
which
these
words
were
pronounced
pierre
who
had
so
long
been
considering
his
career
wished
to
make
some
suggestion
but
prince
vasili
interrupted
him
in
the
special
deep
cooing
tone
precluding
the
possibility
of
interrupting
his
speech
which
he
used
in
extreme
cases
when
special
persuasion
was
needed
mais
mon
cher
i
did
this
for
my
own
sake
to
satisfy
my
conscience
and
there
is
nothing
to
thank
me
for
no
one
has
ever
complained
yet
of
being
too
much
loved
and
besides
you
are
free
you
could
throw
it
up
tomorrow
but
you
will
see
everything
for
yourself
when
you
get
to
petersburg
it
is
high
time
for
you
to
get
away
from
these
terrible
recollections

sighed
yes
yes
my
boy
and
my
valet
can
go
in
your
carriage
ah
i
was
nearly
forgetting
he
added
you
know
mon
cher
your
father
and
i
had
some
accounts
to
settle
so
i
have
received
what
was
due
from
the
ryazan
estate
and
will
keep
it
you
won
t
require
it
we
ll
go
into
the
accounts
later
by
what
was
due
from
the
ryazan
estate
prince
vasili
meant
several
thousand
rubles
quitrent
received
from
pierre
s
peasants
which
the
prince
had
retained
for
himself
in
petersburg
as
in
moscow
pierre
found
the
same
atmosphere
of
gentleness
and
affection
he
could
not
refuse
the
post
or
rather
the
rank
for
he
did
nothing
that
prince
vasili
had
procured
for
him
and
acquaintances
invitations
and
social
occupations
were
so
numerous
that
even
more
than
in
moscow
he
felt
a
sense
of
bewilderment
bustle
and
continual
expectation
of
some
good
always
in
front
of
him
but
never
attained
of
his
former
bachelor
acquaintances
many
were
no
longer
in
petersburg
the
guards
had
gone
to
the
front
dolokhov
had
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
anatole
was
in
the
army
somewhere
in
the
provinces
prince
andrew
was
abroad
so
pierre
had
not
the
opportunity
to
spend
his
nights
as
he
used
to
like
to
spend
them
or
to
open
his
mind
by
intimate
talks
with
a
friend
older
than
himself
and
whom
he
respected
his
whole
time
was
taken
up
with
dinners
and
balls
and
was
spent
chiefly
at
prince
vasili
s
house
in
the
company
of
the
stout
princess
his
wife
and
his
beautiful
daughter
helene
like
the
others
anna
pavlovna
scherer
showed
pierre
the
change
of
attitude
toward
him
that
had
taken
place
in
society
formerly
in
anna
pavlovna
s
presence
pierre
had
always
felt
that
what
he
was
saying
was
out
of
place
tactless
and
unsuitable
that
remarks
which
seemed
to
him
clever
while
they
formed
in
his
mind
became
foolish
as
soon
as
he
uttered
them
while
on
the
contrary
hippolyte
s
stupidest
remarks
came
out
clever
and
apt
now
everything
pierre
said
was
charmant
even
if
anna
pavlovna
did
not
say
so
he
could
see
that
she
wished
to
and
only
refrained
out
of
regard
for
his
modesty
in
the
beginning
of
the
winter
of
pierre
received
one
of
anna
pavlovna
s
usual
pink
notes
with
an
invitation
to
which
was
added
you
will
find
the
beautiful
helene
here
whom
it
is
always
delightful
to
see
when
he
read
that
sentence
pierre
felt
for
the
first
time
that
some
link
which
other
people
recognized
had
grown
up
between
himself
and
helene
and
that
thought
both
alarmed
him
as
if
some
obligation
were
being
imposed
on
him
which
he
could
not
fulfill
and
pleased
him
as
an
entertaining
supposition
anna
pavlovna
s
at
home
was
like
the
former
one
only
the
novelty
she
offered
her
guests
this
time
was
not
mortemart
but
a
diplomatist
fresh
from
berlin
with
the
very
latest
details
of
the
emperor
alexander
s
visit
to
potsdam
and
of
how
the
two
august
friends
had
pledged
themselves
in
an
indissoluble
alliance
to
uphold
the
cause
of
justice
against
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
anna
pavlovna
received
pierre
with
a
shade
of
melancholy
evidently
relating
to
the
young
man
s
recent
loss
by
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
everyone
constantly
considered
it
a
duty
to
assure
pierre
that
he
was
greatly
afflicted
by
the
death
of
the
father
he
had
hardly
known
and
her
melancholy
was
just
like
the
august
melancholy
she
showed
at
the
mention
of
her
most
august
majesty
the
empress
marya
fedorovna
pierre
felt
flattered
by
this
anna
pavlovna
arranged
the
different
groups
in
her
drawing
room
with
her
habitual
skill
the
large
group
in
which
were
prince
vasili
and
the
generals
had
the
benefit
of
the
diplomat
another
group
was
at
the
tea
table
pierre
wished
to
join
the
former
but
anna
pavlovna
who
was
in
the
excited
condition
of
a
commander
on
a
battlefield
to
whom
thousands
of
new
and
brilliant
ideas
occur
which
there
is
hardly
time
to
put
in
action
seeing
pierre
touched
his
sleeve
with
her
finger
saying
wait
a
bit
i
have
something
in
view
for
you
this
evening
she
glanced
at
helene
and
smiled
at
her
my
dear
helene
be
charitable
to
my
poor
aunt
who
adores
you
go
and
keep
her
company
for
ten
minutes
and
that
it
will
not
be
too
dull
here
is
the
dear
count
who
will
not
refuse
to
accompany
you
the
beauty
went
to
the
aunt
but
anna
pavlovna
detained
pierre
looking
as
if
she
had
to
give
some
final
necessary
instructions
isn
t
she
exquisite
she
said
to
pierre
pointing
to
the
stately
beauty
as
she
glided
away
and
how
she
carries
herself
for
so
young
a
girl
such
tact
such
masterly
perfection
of
manner
it
comes
from
her
heart
happy
the
man
who
wins
her
with
her
the
least
worldly
of
men
would
occupy
a
most
brilliant
position
in
society
don
t
you
think
so
i
only
wanted
to
know
your
opinion
and
anna
pavlovna
let
pierre
go
pierre
in
reply
sincerely
agreed
with
her
as
to
helene
s
perfection
of
manner
if
he
ever
thought
of
helene
it
was
just
of
her
beauty
and
her
remarkable
skill
in
appearing
silently
dignified
in
society
the
old
aunt
received
the
two
young
people
in
her
corner
but
seemed
desirous
of
hiding
her
adoration
for
helene
and
inclined
rather
to
show
her
fear
of
anna
pavlovna
she
looked
at
her
niece
as
if
inquiring
what
she
was
to
do
with
these
people
on
leaving
them
anna
pavlovna
again
touched
pierre
s
sleeve
saying
i
hope
you
won
t
say
that
it
is
dull
in
my
house
again
and
she
glanced
at
helene
helene
smiled
with
a
look
implying
that
she
did
not
admit
the
possibility
of
anyone
seeing
her
without
being
enchanted
the
aunt
coughed
swallowed
and
said
in
french
that
she
was
very
pleased
to
see
helene
then
she
turned
to
pierre
with
the
same
words
of
welcome
and
the
same
look
in
the
middle
of
a
dull
and
halting
conversation
helene
turned
to
pierre
with
the
beautiful
bright
smile
that
she
gave
to
everyone
pierre
was
so
used
to
that
smile
and
it
had
so
little
meaning
for
him
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
it
the
aunt
was
just
speaking
of
a
collection
of
snuffboxes
that
had
belonged
to
pierre
s
father
count
bezukhov
and
showed
them
her
own
box
princess
helene
asked
to
see
the
portrait
of
the
aunt
s
husband
on
the
box
lid
that
is
probably
the
work
of
vinesse
said
pierre
mentioning
a
celebrated
miniaturist
and
he
leaned
over
the
table
to
take
the
snuffbox
while
trying
to
hear
what
was
being
said
at
the
other
table
he
half
rose
meaning
to
go
round
but
the
aunt
handed
him
the
snuffbox
passing
it
across
helene
s
back
helene
stooped
forward
to
make
room
and
looked
round
with
a
smile
she
was
as
always
at
evening
parties
wearing
a
dress
such
as
was
then
fashionable
cut
very
low
at
front
and
back
her
bust
which
had
always
seemed
like
marble
to
pierre
was
so
close
to
him
that
his
shortsighted
eyes
could
not
but
perceive
the
living
charm
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
so
near
to
his
lips
that
he
need
only
have
bent
his
head
a
little
to
have
touched
them
he
was
conscious
of
the
warmth
of
her
body
the
scent
of
perfume
and
the
creaking
of
her
corset
as
she
moved
he
did
not
see
her
marble
beauty
forming
a
complete
whole
with
her
dress
but
all
the
charm
of
her
body
only
covered
by
her
garments
and
having
once
seen
this
he
could
not
help
being
aware
of
it
just
as
we
cannot
renew
an
illusion
we
have
once
seen
through
so
you
have
never
noticed
before
how
beautiful
i
am
helene
seemed
to
say
you
had
not
noticed
that
i
am
a
woman
yes
i
am
a
woman
who
may
belong
to
anyone
to
you
too
said
her
glance
and
at
that
moment
pierre
felt
that
helene
not
only
could
but
must
be
his
wife
and
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
he
knew
this
at
that
moment
as
surely
as
if
he
had
been
standing
at
the
altar
with
her
how
and
when
this
would
be
he
did
not
know
he
did
not
even
know
if
it
would
be
a
good
thing
he
even
felt
he
knew
not
why
that
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
but
he
knew
it
would
happen
pierre
dropped
his
eyes
lifted
them
again
and
wished
once
more
to
see
her
as
a
distant
beauty
far
removed
from
him
as
he
had
seen
her
every
day
until
then
but
he
could
no
longer
do
it
he
could
not
any
more
than
a
man
who
has
been
looking
at
a
tuft
of
steppe
grass
through
the
mist
and
taking
it
for
a
tree
can
again
take
it
for
a
tree
after
he
has
once
recognized
it
to
be
a
tuft
of
grass
she
was
terribly
close
to
him
she
already
had
power
over
him
and
between
them
there
was
no
longer
any
barrier
except
the
barrier
of
his
own
will
well
i
will
leave
you
in
your
little
corner
came
anna
pavlovna
s
voice
i
see
you
are
all
right
there
and
pierre
anxiously
trying
to
remember
whether
he
had
done
anything
reprehensible
looked
round
with
a
blush
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
as
he
knew
it
himself
a
little
later
when
he
went
up
to
the
large
circle
anna
pavlovna
said
to
him
i
hear
you
are
refitting
your
petersburg
house
this
was
true
the
architect
had
told
him
that
it
was
necessary
and
pierre
without
knowing
why
was
having
his
enormous
petersburg
house
done
up
that
s
a
good
thing
but
don
t
move
from
prince
vasili
s
it
is
good
to
have
a
friend
like
the
prince
she
said
smiling
at
prince
vasili
i
know
something
about
that
don
t
i
and
you
are
still
so
young
you
need
advice
don
t
be
angry
with
me
for
exercising
an
old
woman
s
privilege
she
paused
as
women
always
do
expecting
something
after
they
have
mentioned
their
age
if
you
marry
it
will
be
a
different
thing
she
continued
uniting
them
both
in
one
glance
pierre
did
not
look
at
helene
nor
she
at
him
but
she
was
just
as
terribly
close
to
him
he
muttered
something
and
colored
when
he
got
home
he
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
for
thinking
of
what
had
happened
what
had
happened
nothing
he
had
merely
understood
that
the
woman
he
had
known
as
a
child
of
whom
when
her
beauty
was
mentioned
he
had
said
absent
mindedly
yes
she
s
good
looking
he
had
understood
that
this
woman
might
belong
to
him
but
she
s
stupid
i
have
myself
said
she
is
stupid
he
thought
there
is
something
nasty
something
wrong
in
the
feeling
she
excites
in
me
i
have
been
told
that
her
brother
anatole
was
in
love
with
her
and
she
with
him
that
there
was
quite
a
scandal
and
that
that
s
why
he
was
sent
away
hippolyte
is
her
brother
prince
vasili
is
her
father
it
s
bad
he
reflected
but
while
he
was
thinking
this
the
reflection
was
still
incomplete
he
caught
himself
smiling
and
was
conscious
that
another
line
of
thought
had
sprung
up
and
while
thinking
of
her
worthlessness
he
was
also
dreaming
of
how
she
would
be
his
wife
how
she
would
love
him
become
quite
different
and
how
all
he
had
thought
and
heard
of
her
might
be
false
and
he
again
saw
her
not
as
the
daughter
of
prince
vasili
but
visualized
her
whole
body
only
veiled
by
its
gray
dress
but
no
why
did
this
thought
never
occur
to
me
before
and
again
he
told
himself
that
it
was
impossible
that
there
would
be
something
unnatural
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
dishonorable
in
this
marriage
he
recalled
her
former
words
and
looks
and
the
words
and
looks
of
those
who
had
seen
them
together
he
recalled
anna
pavlovna
s
words
and
looks
when
she
spoke
to
him
about
his
house
recalled
thousands
of
such
hints
from
prince
vasili
and
others
and
was
seized
by
terror
lest
he
had
already
in
some
way
bound
himself
to
do
something
that
was
evidently
wrong
and
that
he
ought
not
to
do
but
at
the
very
time
he
was
expressing
this
conviction
to
himself
in
another
part
of
his
mind
her
image
rose
in
all
its
womanly
beauty
chapter
ii
in
november
prince
vasili
had
to
go
on
a
tour
of
inspection
in
four
different
provinces
he
had
arranged
this
for
himself
so
as
to
visit
his
neglected
estates
at
the
same
time
and
pick
up
his
son
anatole
where
his
regiment
was
stationed
and
take
him
to
visit
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
in
order
to
arrange
a
match
for
him
with
the
daughter
of
that
rich
old
man
but
before
leaving
home
and
undertaking
these
new
affairs
prince
vasili
had
to
settle
matters
with
pierre
who
it
is
true
had
latterly
spent
whole
days
at
home
that
is
in
prince
vasili
s
house
where
he
was
staying
and
had
been
absurd
excited
and
foolish
in
helene
s
presence
as
a
lover
should
be
but
had
not
yet
proposed
to
her
this
is
all
very
fine
but
things
must
be
settled
said
prince
vasili
to
himself
with
a
sorrowful
sigh
one
morning
feeling
that
pierre
who
was
under
such
obligations
to
him
but
never
mind
that
was
not
behaving
very
well
in
this
matter
youth
frivolity
well
god
be
with
him
thought
he
relishing
his
own
goodness
of
heart
but
it
must
be
brought
to
a
head
the
day
after
tomorrow
will
be
lelya
s
name
day
i
will
invite
two
or
three
people
and
if
he
does
not
understand
what
he
ought
to
do
then
it
will
be
my
affair
yes
my
affair
i
am
her
father
six
weeks
after
anna
pavlovna
s
at
home
and
after
the
sleepless
night
when
he
had
decided
that
to
marry
helene
would
be
a
calamity
and
that
he
ought
to
avoid
her
and
go
away
pierre
despite
that
decision
had
not
left
prince
vasili
s
and
felt
with
terror
that
in
people
s
eyes
he
was
every
day
more
and
more
connected
with
her
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
return
to
his
former
conception
of
her
that
he
could
not
break
away
from
her
and
that
though
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
he
would
have
to
unite
his
fate
with
hers
he
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
free
himself
but
that
prince
vasili
who
had
rarely
before
given
receptions
now
hardly
let
a
day
go
by
without
having
an
evening
party
at
which
pierre
had
to
be
present
unless
he
wished
to
spoil
the
general
pleasure
and
disappoint
everyone
s
expectation
prince
vasili
in
the
rare
moments
when
he
was
at
home
would
take
pierre
s
hand
in
passing
and
draw
it
downwards
or
absent
mindedly
hold
out
his
wrinkled
clean
shaven
cheek
for
pierre
to
kiss
and
would
say
till
tomorrow
or
be
in
to
dinner
or
i
shall
not
see
you
or
i
am
staying
in
for
your
sake
and
so
on
and
though
prince
vasili
when
he
stayed
in
as
he
said
for
pierre
s
sake
hardly
exchanged
a
couple
of
words
with
him
pierre
felt
unable
to
disappoint
him
every
day
he
said
to
himself
one
and
the
same
thing
it
is
time
i
understood
her
and
made
up
my
mind
what
she
really
is
was
i
mistaken
before
or
am
i
mistaken
now
no
she
is
not
stupid
she
is
an
excellent
girl
he
sometimes
said
to
himself
she
never
makes
a
mistake
never
says
anything
stupid
she
says
little
but
what
she
does
say
is
always
clear
and
simple
so
she
is
not
stupid
she
never
was
abashed
and
is
not
abashed
now
so
she
cannot
be
a
bad
woman
he
had
often
begun
to
make
reflections
or
think
aloud
in
her
company
and
she
had
always
answered
him
either
by
a
brief
but
appropriate
remark
showing
that
it
did
not
interest
her
or
by
a
silent
look
and
smile
which
more
palpably
than
anything
else
showed
pierre
her
superiority
she
was
right
in
regarding
all
arguments
as
nonsense
in
comparison
with
that
smile
she
always
addressed
him
with
a
radiantly
confiding
smile
meant
for
him
alone
in
which
there
was
something
more
significant
than
in
the
general
smile
that
usually
brightened
her
face
pierre
knew
that
everyone
was
waiting
for
him
to
say
a
word
and
cross
a
certain
line
and
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
step
across
it
but
an
incomprehensible
terror
seized
him
at
the
thought
of
that
dreadful
step
a
thousand
times
during
that
month
and
a
half
while
he
felt
himself
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
to
that
dreadful
abyss
pierre
said
to
himself
what
am
i
doing
i
need
resolution
can
it
be
that
i
have
none
he
wished
to
take
a
decision
but
felt
with
dismay
that
in
this
matter
he
lacked
that
strength
of
will
which
he
had
known
in
himself
and
really
possessed
pierre
was
one
of
those
who
are
only
strong
when
they
feel
themselves
quite
innocent
and
since
that
day
when
he
was
overpowered
by
a
feeling
of
desire
while
stooping
over
the
snuffbox
at
anna
pavlovna
s
an
unacknowledged
sense
of
the
guilt
of
that
desire
paralyzed
his
will
on
helene
s
name
day
a
small
party
of
just
their
own
people
as
his
wife
said
met
for
supper
at
prince
vasili
s
all
these
friends
and
relations
had
been
given
to
understand
that
the
fate
of
the
young
girl
would
be
decided
that
evening
the
visitors
were
seated
at
supper
princess
kuragina
a
portly
imposing
woman
who
had
once
been
handsome
was
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
table
on
either
side
of
her
sat
the
more
important
guests
an
old
general
and
his
wife
and
anna
pavlovna
scherer
at
the
other
end
sat
the
younger
and
less
important
guests
and
there
too
sat
the
members
of
the
family
and
pierre
and
helene
side
by
side
prince
vasili
was
not
having
any
supper
he
went
round
the
table
in
a
merry
mood
sitting
down
now
by
one
now
by
another
of
the
guests
to
each
of
them
he
made
some
careless
and
agreeable
remark
except
to
pierre
and
helene
whose
presence
he
seemed
not
to
notice
he
enlivened
the
whole
party
the
wax
candles
burned
brightly
the
silver
and
crystal
gleamed
so
did
the
ladies
toilets
and
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
men
s
epaulets
servants
in
scarlet
liveries
moved
round
the
table
the
clatter
of
plates
knives
and
glasses
mingled
with
the
animated
hum
of
several
conversations
at
one
end
of
the
table
the
old
chamberlain
was
heard
assuring
an
old
baroness
that
he
loved
her
passionately
at
which
she
laughed
at
the
other
could
be
heard
the
story
of
the
misfortunes
of
some
mary
viktorovna
or
other
at
the
center
of
the
table
prince
vasili
attracted
everybody
s
attention
with
a
facetious
smile
on
his
face
he
was
telling
the
ladies
about
last
wednesday
s
meeting
of
the
imperial
council
at
which
sergey
kuzmich
vyazmitinov
the
new
military
governor
general
of
petersburg
had
received
and
read
the
then
famous
rescript
of
the
emperor
alexander
from
the
army
to
sergey
kuzmich
in
which
the
emperor
said
that
he
was
receiving
from
all
sides
declarations
of
the
people
s
loyalty
that
the
declaration
from
petersburg
gave
him
particular
pleasure
and
that
he
was
proud
to
be
at
the
head
of
such
a
nation
and
would
endeavor
to
be
worthy
of
it
this
rescript
began
with
the
words
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides
reports
reach
me
etc
well
and
so
he
never
got
farther
than
sergey
kuzmich
asked
one
of
the
ladies
exactly
not
a
hair
s
breadth
farther
answered
prince
vasili
laughing
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides
from
all
sides
sergey
kuzmich
poor
vyazmitinov
could
not
get
any
farther
he
began
the
rescript
again
and
again
but
as
soon
as
he
uttered
sergey
he
sobbed
kuz
mi
ch
tears
and
from
all
sides
was
smothered
in
sobs
and
he
could
get
no
farther
and
again
his
handkerchief
and
again
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides
and
tears
till
at
last
somebody
else
was
asked
to
read
it
kuzmich
from
all
sides
and
then
tears
someone
repeated
laughing
don
t
be
unkind
cried
anna
pavlovna
from
her
end
of
the
table
holding
up
a
threatening
finger
he
is
such
a
worthy
and
excellent
man
our
dear
vyazmitinov
everybody
laughed
a
great
deal
at
the
head
of
the
table
where
the
honored
guests
sat
everyone
seemed
to
be
in
high
spirits
and
under
the
influence
of
a
variety
of
exciting
sensations
only
pierre
and
helene
sat
silently
side
by
side
almost
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
a
suppressed
smile
brightening
both
their
faces
a
smile
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
sergey
kuzmich
a
smile
of
bashfulness
at
their
own
feelings
but
much
as
all
the
rest
laughed
talked
and
joked
much
as
they
enjoyed
their
rhine
wine
saute
and
ices
and
however
they
avoided
looking
at
the
young
couple
and
heedless
and
unobservant
as
they
seemed
of
them
one
could
feel
by
the
occasional
glances
they
gave
that
the
story
about
sergey
kuzmich
the
laughter
and
the
food
were
all
a
pretense
and
that
the
whole
attention
of
that
company
was
directed
to
pierre
and
helene
prince
vasili
mimicked
the
sobbing
of
sergey
kuzmich
and
at
the
same
time
his
eyes
glanced
toward
his
daughter
and
while
he
laughed
the
expression
on
his
face
clearly
said
yes
it
s
getting
on
it
will
all
be
settled
today
anna
pavlovna
threatened
him
on
behalf
of
our
dear
vyazmitinov
and
in
her
eyes
which
for
an
instant
glanced
at
pierre
prince
vasili
read
a
congratulation
on
his
future
son
in
law
and
on
his
daughter
s
happiness
the
old
princess
sighed
sadly
as
she
offered
some
wine
to
the
old
lady
next
to
her
and
glanced
angrily
at
her
daughter
and
her
sigh
seemed
to
say
yes
there
s
nothing
left
for
you
and
me
but
to
sip
sweet
wine
my
dear
now
that
the
time
has
come
for
these
young
ones
to
be
thus
boldly
provocatively
happy
and
what
nonsense
all
this
is
that
i
am
saying
thought
a
diplomatist
glancing
at
the
happy
faces
of
the
lovers
that
s
happiness
into
the
insignificant
trifling
and
artificial
interests
uniting
that
society
had
entered
the
simple
feeling
of
the
attraction
of
a
healthy
and
handsome
young
man
and
woman
for
one
another
and
this
human
feeling
dominated
everything
else
and
soared
above
all
their
affected
chatter
jests
fell
flat
news
was
not
interesting
and
the
animation
was
evidently
forced
not
only
the
guests
but
even
the
footmen
waiting
at
table
seemed
to
feel
this
and
they
forgot
their
duties
as
they
looked
at
the
beautiful
helene
with
her
radiant
face
and
at
the
red
broad
and
happy
though
uneasy
face
of
pierre
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
light
of
the
candles
was
focused
on
those
two
happy
faces
alone
pierre
felt
that
he
was
the
center
of
it
all
and
this
both
pleased
and
embarrassed
him
he
was
like
a
man
entirely
absorbed
in
some
occupation
he
did
not
see
hear
or
understand
anything
clearly
only
now
and
then
detached
ideas
and
impressions
from
the
world
of
reality
shot
unexpectedly
through
his
mind
so
it
is
all
finished
he
thought
and
how
has
it
all
happened
how
quickly
now
i
know
that
not
because
of
her
alone
nor
of
myself
alone
but
because
of
everyone
it
must
inevitably
come
about
they
are
all
expecting
it
they
are
so
sure
that
it
will
happen
that
i
cannot
i
cannot
disappoint
them
but
how
will
it
be
i
do
not
know
but
it
will
certainly
happen
thought
pierre
glancing
at
those
dazzling
shoulders
close
to
his
eyes
or
he
would
suddenly
feel
ashamed
of
he
knew
not
what
he
felt
it
awkward
to
attract
everyone
s
attention
and
to
be
considered
a
lucky
man
and
with
his
plain
face
to
be
looked
on
as
a
sort
of
paris
possessed
of
a
helen
but
no
doubt
it
always
is
and
must
be
so
he
consoled
himself
and
besides
what
have
i
done
to
bring
it
about
how
did
it
begin
i
traveled
from
moscow
with
prince
vasili
then
there
was
nothing
so
why
should
i
not
stay
at
his
house
then
i
played
cards
with
her
and
picked
up
her
reticule
and
drove
out
with
her
how
did
it
begin
when
did
it
all
come
about
and
here
he
was
sitting
by
her
side
as
her
betrothed
seeing
hearing
feeling
her
nearness
her
breathing
her
movements
her
beauty
then
it
would
suddenly
seem
to
him
that
it
was
not
she
but
he
was
so
unusually
beautiful
and
that
that
was
why
they
all
looked
so
at
him
and
flattered
by
this
general
admiration
he
would
expand
his
chest
raise
his
head
and
rejoice
at
his
good
fortune
suddenly
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
repeating
something
to
him
a
second
time
but
pierre
was
so
absorbed
that
he
did
not
understand
what
was
said
i
am
asking
you
when
you
last
heard
from
bolkonski
repeated
prince
vasili
a
third
time
how
absent
minded
you
are
my
dear
fellow
prince
vasili
smiled
and
pierre
noticed
that
everyone
was
smiling
at
him
and
helene
well
what
of
it
if
you
all
know
it
thought
pierre
what
of
it
it
s
the
truth
and
he
himself
smiled
his
gentle
childlike
smile
and
helene
smiled
too
when
did
you
get
the
letter
was
it
from
olmutz
repeated
prince
vasili
who
pretended
to
want
to
know
this
in
order
to
settle
a
dispute
how
can
one
talk
or
think
of
such
trifles
thought
pierre
yes
from
olmutz
he
answered
with
a
sigh
after
supper
pierre
with
his
partner
followed
the
others
into
the
drawing
room
the
guests
began
to
disperse
some
without
taking
leave
of
helene
some
as
if
unwilling
to
distract
her
from
an
important
occupation
came
up
to
her
for
a
moment
and
made
haste
to
go
away
refusing
to
let
her
see
them
off
the
diplomatist
preserved
a
mournful
silence
as
he
left
the
drawing
room
he
pictured
the
vanity
of
his
diplomatic
career
in
comparison
with
pierre
s
happiness
the
old
general
grumbled
at
his
wife
when
she
asked
how
his
leg
was
oh
the
old
fool
he
thought
that
princess
helene
will
be
beautiful
still
when
she
s
fifty
i
think
i
may
congratulate
you
whispered
anna
pavlovna
to
the
old
princess
kissing
her
soundly
if
i
hadn
t
this
headache
i
d
have
stayed
longer
the
old
princess
did
not
reply
she
was
tormented
by
jealousy
of
her
daughter
s
happiness
while
the
guests
were
taking
their
leave
pierre
remained
for
a
long
time
alone
with
helene
in
the
little
drawing
room
where
they
were
sitting
he
had
often
before
during
the
last
six
weeks
remained
alone
with
her
but
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
love
now
he
felt
that
it
was
inevitable
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
take
the
final
step
he
felt
ashamed
he
felt
that
he
was
occupying
someone
else
s
place
here
beside
helene
this
happiness
is
not
for
you
some
inner
voice
whispered
to
him
this
happiness
is
for
those
who
have
not
in
them
what
there
is
in
you
but
as
he
had
to
say
something
he
began
by
asking
her
whether
she
was
satisfied
with
the
party
she
replied
in
her
usual
simple
manner
that
this
name
day
of
hers
had
been
one
of
the
pleasantest
she
had
ever
had
some
of
the
nearest
relatives
had
not
yet
left
they
were
sitting
in
the
large
drawing
room
prince
vasili
came
up
to
pierre
with
languid
footsteps
pierre
rose
and
said
it
was
getting
late
prince
vasili
gave
him
a
look
of
stern
inquiry
as
though
what
pierre
had
just
said
was
so
strange
that
one
could
not
take
it
in
but
then
the
expression
of
severity
changed
and
he
drew
pierre
s
hand
downwards
made
him
sit
down
and
smiled
affectionately
well
lelya
he
asked
turning
instantly
to
his
daughter
and
addressing
her
with
the
careless
tone
of
habitual
tenderness
natural
to
parents
who
have
petted
their
children
from
babyhood
but
which
prince
vasili
had
only
acquired
by
imitating
other
parents
and
he
again
turned
to
pierre
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides
he
said
unbuttoning
the
top
button
of
his
waistcoat
pierre
smiled
but
his
smile
showed
that
he
knew
it
was
not
the
story
about
sergey
kuzmich
that
interested
prince
vasili
just
then
and
prince
vasili
saw
that
pierre
knew
this
he
suddenly
muttered
something
and
went
away
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
even
the
prince
was
disconcerted
the
sight
of
the
discomposure
of
that
old
man
of
the
world
touched
pierre
he
looked
at
helene
and
she
too
seemed
disconcerted
and
her
look
seemed
to
say
well
it
is
your
own
fault
the
step
must
be
taken
but
i
cannot
i
cannot
thought
pierre
and
he
again
began
speaking
about
indifferent
matters
about
sergey
kuzmich
asking
what
the
point
of
the
story
was
as
he
had
not
heard
it
properly
helene
answered
with
a
smile
that
she
too
had
missed
it
when
prince
vasili
returned
to
the
drawing
room
the
princess
his
wife
was
talking
in
low
tones
to
the
elderly
lady
about
pierre
of
course
it
is
a
very
brilliant
match
but
happiness
my
dear
marriages
are
made
in
heaven
replied
the
elderly
lady
prince
vasili
passed
by
seeming
not
to
hear
the
ladies
and
sat
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
he
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
dozing
his
head
sank
forward
and
then
he
roused
himself
aline
he
said
to
his
wife
go
and
see
what
they
are
about
the
princess
went
up
to
the
door
passed
by
it
with
a
dignified
and
indifferent
air
and
glanced
into
the
little
drawing
room
pierre
and
helene
still
sat
talking
just
as
before
still
the
same
she
said
to
her
husband
prince
vasili
frowned
twisting
his
mouth
his
cheeks
quivered
and
his
face
assumed
the
coarse
unpleasant
expression
peculiar
to
him
shaking
himself
he
rose
threw
back
his
head
and
with
resolute
steps
went
past
the
ladies
into
the
little
drawing
room
with
quick
steps
he
went
joyfully
up
to
pierre
his
face
was
so
unusually
triumphant
that
pierre
rose
in
alarm
on
seeing
it
thank
god
said
prince
vasili
my
wife
has
told
me
everything
he
put
one
arm
around
pierre
and
the
other
around
his
daughter
my
dear
boy
lelya
i
am
very
pleased
his
voice
trembled
i
loved
your
father
and
she
will
make
you
a
good
wife
god
bless
you
he
embraced
his
daughter
and
then
again
pierre
and
kissed
him
with
his
malodorous
mouth
tears
actually
moistened
his
cheeks
princess
come
here
he
shouted
the
old
princess
came
in
and
also
wept
the
elderly
lady
was
using
her
handkerchief
too
pierre
was
kissed
and
he
kissed
the
beautiful
helene
s
hand
several
times
after
a
while
they
were
left
alone
again
all
this
had
to
be
and
could
not
be
otherwise
thought
pierre
so
it
is
useless
to
ask
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
it
is
good
because
it
s
definite
and
one
is
rid
of
the
old
tormenting
doubt
pierre
held
the
hand
of
his
betrothed
in
silence
looking
at
her
beautiful
bosom
as
it
rose
and
fell
helene
he
said
aloud
and
paused
something
special
is
always
said
in
such
cases
he
thought
but
could
not
remember
what
it
was
that
people
say
he
looked
at
her
face
she
drew
nearer
to
him
her
face
flushed
oh
take
those
off
those
she
said
pointing
to
his
spectacles
pierre
took
them
off
and
his
eyes
besides
the
strange
look
eyes
have
from
which
spectacles
have
just
been
removed
had
also
a
frightened
and
inquiring
look
he
was
about
to
stoop
over
her
hand
and
kiss
it
but
with
a
rapid
almost
brutal
movement
of
her
head
she
intercepted
his
lips
and
met
them
with
her
own
her
face
struck
pierre
by
its
altered
unpleasantly
excited
expression
it
is
too
late
now
it
s
done
besides
i
love
her
thought
pierre
je
vous
aime
he
said
remembering
what
has
to
be
said
at
such
moments
but
his
words
sounded
so
weak
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
i
love
you
six
weeks
later
he
was
married
and
settled
in
count
bezukhov
s
large
newly
furnished

the
happy
possessor

of

chapter
iii
old
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
received
a
letter
from
prince
vasili
in
november
announcing
that
he
and
his
son
would
be
paying
him
a
visit
i
am
starting
on
a
journey
of
inspection
and
of
course
i
shall
think
nothing
of
an
extra
seventy
miles
to
come
and
see
you
at
the
same
time
my
honored
benefactor
wrote
prince
vasili
my
son
anatole
is
accompanying
me
on
his
way
to
the
army
so
i
hope
you
will
allow
him
personally
to
express
the
deep
respect
that
emulating
his
father
he
feels
for
you
it
seems
that
there
will
be
no
need
to
bring
mary
out
suitors
are
coming
to
us
of
their
own
accord
incautiously
remarked
the
little
princess
on
hearing
the
news
prince
nicholas
frowned
but
said
nothing
a
fortnight
after
the
letter
prince
vasili
s
servants
came
one
evening
in
advance
of
him
and
he
and
his
son
arrived
next
day
old
bolkonski
had
always
had
a
poor
opinion
of
prince
vasili
s
character
but
more
so
recently
since
in
the
new
reigns
of
paul
and
alexander
prince
vasili
had
risen
to
high
position
and
honors
and
now
from
the
hints
contained
in
his
letter
and
given
by
the
little
princess
he
saw
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
and
his
low
opinion
changed
into
a
feeling
of
contemptuous
ill
will
he
snorted
whenever
he
mentioned
him
on
the
day
of
prince
vasili
s
arrival
prince
bolkonski
was
particularly
discontented
and
out
of
temper
whether
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
because
prince
vasili
was
coming
or
whether
his
being
in
a
bad
temper
made
him
specially
annoyed
at
prince
vasili
s
visit
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
and
in
the
morning
tikhon
had
already
advised
the
architect
not
to
go
to
the
prince
with
his
report
do
you
hear
how
he
s
walking
said
tikhon
drawing
the
architect
s
attention
to
the
sound
of
the
prince
s
footsteps
stepping
flat
on
his
heels
we
know
what
that
means
however
at
nine
o
clock
the
prince
in
his
velvet
coat
with
a
sable
collar
and
cap
went
out
for
his
usual
walk
it
had
snowed
the
day
before
and
the
path
to
the
hothouse
along
which
the
prince
was
in
the
habit
of
walking
had
been
swept
the
marks
of
the
broom
were
still
visible
in
the
snow
and
a
shovel
had
been
left
sticking
in
one
of
the
soft
snowbanks
that
bordered
both
sides
of
the
path
the
prince
went
through
the
conservatories
the
serfs
quarters
and
the
outbuildings
frowning
and
silent
can
a
sleigh
pass
he
asked
his
overseer
a
venerable
man
resembling
his
master
in
manners
and
looks
who
was
accompanying
him
back
to
the
house
the
snow
is
deep
i
am
having
the
avenue
swept
your
honor
the
prince
bowed
his
head
and
went
up
to
the
porch
god
be
thanked
thought
the
overseer
the
storm
has
blown
over
it
would
have
been
hard
to
drive
up
your
honor
he
added
i
heard
your
honor
that
a
minister
is
coming
to
visit
your
honor
the
prince
turned
round
to
the
overseer
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
frowning
what
a
minister
what
minister
who
gave
orders
he
said
in
his
shrill
harsh
voice
the
road
is
not
swept
for
the
princess
my
daughter
but
for
a
minister
for
me
there
are
no
ministers
your
honor
i
thought
you
thought
shouted
the
prince
his
words
coming
more
and
more
rapidly
and
indistinctly
you
thought
rascals
blackguards
i
ll
teach
you
to
think
and
lifting
his
stick
he
swung
it
and
would
have
hit
alpatych
the
overseer
had
not
the
latter
instinctively
avoided
the
blow
thought
blackguards
shouted
the
prince
rapidly
but
although
alpatych
frightened
at
his
own
temerity
in
avoiding
the
stroke
came
up
to
the
prince
bowing
his
bald
head
resignedly
before
him
or
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
the
prince
though
he
continued
to
shout
blackguards
throw
the
snow
back
on
the
road
did
not
lift
his
stick
again
but
hurried
into
the
house
before
dinner
princess
mary
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
who
knew
that
the
prince
was
in
a
bad
humor
stood
awaiting
him
mademoiselle
bourienne
with
a
radiant
face
that
said
i
know
nothing
i
am
the
same
as
usual
and
princess
mary
pale
frightened
and
with
downcast
eyes
what
she
found
hardest
to
bear
was
to
know
that
on
such
occasions
she
ought
to
behave
like
mademoiselle
bourienne
but
could
not
she
thought
if
i
seem
not
to
notice
he
will
think
that
i
do
not
sympathize
with
him
if
i
seem
sad
and
out
of
spirits
myself
he
will
say
as
he
has
done
before
that
i
m
in
the
dumps
the
prince
looked
at
his
daughter
s
frightened
face
and
snorted
fool
or
dummy
he
muttered
and
the
other
one
is
not
here
they
ve
been
telling
tales
he
thought
referring
to
the
little
princess
who
was
not
in
the
dining
room
where
is
the
princess
he
asked
hiding
she
is
not
very
well
answered
mademoiselle
bourienne
with
a
bright
smile
so
she
won
t
come
down
it
is
natural
in
her
state
hm
hm
muttered
the
prince
sitting
down
his
plate
seemed
to
him
not
quite
clean
and
pointing
to
a
spot
he
flung
it
away
tikhon
caught
it
and
handed
it
to
a
footman
the
little
princess
was
not
unwell
but
had
such
an
overpowering
fear
of
the
prince
that
hearing
he
was
in
a
bad
humor
she
had
decided
not
to
appear
i
am
afraid
for
the
baby
she
said
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
heaven
knows
what
a
fright
might
do
in
general
at
bald
hills
the
little
princess
lived
in
constant
fear
and
with
a
sense
of
antipathy
to
the
old
prince
which
she
did
not
realize
because
the
fear
was
so
much
the
stronger
feeling
the
prince
reciprocated
this
antipathy
but
it
was
overpowered
by
his
contempt
for
her
when
the
little
princess
had
grown
accustomed
to
life
at
bald
hills
she
took
a
special
fancy
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
spent
whole
days
with
her
asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
room
and
often
talked
with
her
about
the
old
prince
and
criticized
him
so
we
are
to
have
visitors
mon
prince
remarked
mademoiselle
bourienne
unfolding
her
white
napkin
with
her
rosy
fingers
his
excellency
prince
vasili
kuragin
and
his
son
i
understand
she
said
inquiringly
hm
his
excellency
is
a
puppy
i
got
him
his
appointment
in
the
service
said
the
prince
disdainfully
why
his
son
is
coming
i
don
t
understand
perhaps
princess
elizabeth
and
princess
mary
know
i
don
t
want
him
he
looked
at
his
blushing
daughter
are
you
unwell
today
eh
afraid
of
the
minister
as
that
idiot
alpatych
called
him
this
morning
no
mon
pere
though
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
been
so
unsuccessful
in
her
choice
of
a
subject
she
did
not
stop
talking
but
chattered
about
the
conservatories
and
the
beauty
of
a
flower
that
had
just
opened
and
after
the
soup
the
prince
became
more
genial
after
dinner
he
went
to
see
his
daughter
in
law
the
little
princess
was
sitting
at
a
small
table
chattering
with
masha
her
maid
she
grew
pale
on
seeing
her
father
in
law
she
was
much
altered
she
was
now
plain
rather
than
pretty
her
cheeks
had
sunk
her
lip
was
drawn
up
and
her
eyes
drawn
down
yes
i
feel
a
kind
of
oppression
she
said
in
reply
to
the
prince
s
question
as
to
how
she
felt
do
you
want
anything
no
merci
mon
pere
well
all
right
all
right
he
left
the
room
and
went
to
the
waiting
room
where
alpatych
stood
with
bowed
head
has
the
snow
been
shoveled
back
yes
your
excellency
forgive
me
for
heaven
s
sake
it
was
only
my
stupidity
all
right
all
right
interrupted
the
prince
and
laughing
his
unnatural
way
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
alpatych
to
kiss
and
then
proceeded
to
his
study
prince
vasili
arrived
that
evening
he
was
met
in
the
avenue
by
coachmen
and
footmen
who
with
loud
shouts
dragged
his
sleighs
up
to
one
of
the
lodges
over
the
road
purposely
laden
with
snow
prince
vasili
and
anatole
had
separate
rooms
assigned
to
them
anatole
having
taken
off
his
overcoat
sat
with
arms
akimbo
before
a
table
on
a
corner
of
which
he
smilingly
and
absent
mindedly
fixed
his
large
and
handsome
eyes
he
regarded
his
whole
life
as
a
continual
round
of
amusement
which
someone
for
some
reason
had
to
provide
for
him
and
he
looked
on
this
visit
to
a
churlish
old
man
and
a
rich
and
ugly
heiress
in
the
same
way
all
this
might
he
thought
turn
out
very
well
and
amusingly
and
why
not
marry
her
if
she
really
has
so
much
money
that
never
does
any
harm
thought
anatole
he
shaved
and
scented
himself
with
the
care
and
elegance
which
had
become
habitual
to
him
and
his
handsome
head
held
high
entered
his
father
s
room
with
the
good
humored
and
victorious
air
natural
to
him
prince
vasili
s
two
valets
were
busy
dressing
him
and
he
looked
round
with
much
animation
and
cheerfully
nodded
to
his
son
as
the
latter
entered
as
if
to
say
yes
that
s
how
i
want
you
to
look
i
say
father
joking
apart
is
she
very
hideous
anatole
asked
as
if
continuing
a
conversation
the
subject
of
which
had
often
been
mentioned
during
the
journey
enough
what
nonsense
above
all
try
to
be
respectful
and
cautious
with
the
old
prince
if
he
starts
a
row
i
ll
go
away
said
prince
anatole
i
can
t
bear
those
old
men
eh
remember
for
you
everything
depends
on
this
in
the
meantime
not
only
was
it
known
in
the
maidservants
rooms
that
the
minister
and
his
son
had
arrived
but
the
appearance
of
both
had
been
minutely
described
princess
mary
was
sitting
alone
in
her
room
vainly
trying
to
master
her
agitation
why
did
they
write
why
did
lise
tell
me
about
it
it
can
never
happen
she
said
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
how
shall
i
enter
the
drawing
room
even
if
i
like
him
i
can
t
now
be
myself
with
him
the
mere
thought
of
her
father
s
look
filled
her
with
terror
the
little
princess
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
already
received
from
masha
the
lady
s
maid
the
necessary
report
of
how
handsome
the
minister
s
son
was
with
his
rosy
cheeks
and
dark
eyebrows
and
with
what
difficulty
the
father
had
dragged
his
legs
upstairs
while
the
son
had
followed
him
like
an
eagle
three
steps
at
a
time
having
received
this
information
the
little
princess
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
whose
chattering
voices
had
reached
her
from
the
corridor
went
into
princess
mary
s
room
you
know
they
ve
come
marie
said
the
little
princess
waddling
in
and
sinking
heavily
into
an
armchair
she
was
no
longer
in
the
loose
gown
she
generally
wore
in
the
morning
but
had
on
one
of
her
best
dresses
her
hair
was
carefully
done
and
her
face
was
animated
which
however
did
not
conceal
its
sunken
and
faded
outlines
dressed
as
she
used
to
be
in
petersburg
society
it
was
still
more
noticeable
how
much
plainer
she
had
become
some
unobtrusive
touch
had
been
added
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
s
toilet
which
rendered
her
fresh
and
pretty
face
yet
more
attractive
what
are
you
going
to
remain
as
you
are
dear
princess
she
began
they
ll
be
announcing
that
the
gentlemen
are
in
the
drawing
room
and
we
shall
have
to
go
down
and
you
have
not
smartened
yourself
up
at
all
the
little
princess
got
up
rang
for
the
maid
and
hurriedly
and
merrily
began
to
devise
and
carry
out
a
plan
of
how
princess
mary
should
be
dressed
princess
mary
s
self
esteem
was
wounded
by
the
fact
that
the
arrival
of
a
suitor
agitated
her
and
still
more
so
by
both
her
companions
not
having
the
least
conception
that
it
could
be
otherwise
to
tell
them
that
she
felt
ashamed
for
herself
and
for
them
would
be
to
betray
her
agitation
while
to
decline
their
offers
to
dress
her
would
prolong
their
banter
and
insistence
she
flushed
her
beautiful
eyes
grew
dim
red
blotches
came
on
her
face
and
it
took
on
the
unattractive
martyrlike
expression
it
so
often
wore
as
she
submitted
herself
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
lise
both
these
women
quite
sincerely
tried
to
make
her
look
pretty
she
was
so
plain
that
neither
of
them
could
think
of
her
as
a
rival
so
they
began
dressing
her
with
perfect
sincerity
and
with
the
naive
and
firm
conviction
women
have
that
dress
can
make
a
face
pretty
no
really
my
dear
this
dress
is
not
pretty
said
lise
looking
sideways
at
princess
mary
from
a
little
distance
you
have
a
maroon
dress
have
it
fetched
really
you
know
the
fate
of
your
whole
life
may
be
at
stake
but
this
one
is
too
light
it
s
not
becoming
it
was
not
the
dress
but
the
face
and
whole
figure
of
princess
mary
that
was
not
pretty
but
neither
mademoiselle
bourienne
nor
the
little
princess
felt
this
they
still
thought
that
if
a
blue
ribbon
were
placed
in
the
hair
the
hair
combed
up
and
the
blue
scarf
arranged
lower
on
the
best
maroon
dress
and
so
on
all
would
be
well
they
forgot
that
the
frightened
face
and
the
figure
could
not
be
altered
and
that
however
they
might
change
the
setting
and
adornment
of
that
face
it
would
still
remain
piteous
and
plain
after
two
or
three
changes
to
which
princess
mary
meekly
submitted
just
as
her
hair
had
been
arranged
on
the
top
of
her
head
a
style
that
quite
altered
and
spoiled
her
looks
and
she
had
put
on
a
maroon
dress
with
a
pale
blue
scarf
the
little
princess
walked
twice
round
her
now
adjusting
a
fold
of
the
dress
with
her
little
hand
now
arranging
the
scarf
and
looking
at
her
with
her
head
bent
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
no
it
will
not
do
she
said
decidedly
clasping
her
hands
no
mary
really
this
dress
does
not
suit
you
i
prefer
you
in
your
little
gray
everyday
dress
now
please
do
it
for
my
sake
katie
she
said
to
the
maid
bring
the
princess
her
gray
dress
and
you
ll
see
mademoiselle
bourienne
how
i
shall
arrange
it
she
added
smiling
with
a
foretaste
of
artistic
pleasure
but
when
katie
brought
the
required
dress
princess
mary
remained
sitting
motionless
before
the
glass
looking
at
her
face
and
saw
in
the
mirror
her
eyes
full
of
tears
and
her
mouth
quivering
ready
to
burst
into
sobs
come
dear
princess
said
mademoiselle
bourienne
just
one
more
little
effort
the
little
princess
taking
the
dress
from
the
maid
came
up
to
princess
mary
well
now
we
ll
arrange
something
quite
simple
and
becoming
she
said
the
three
voices
hers
mademoiselle
bourienne
s
and
katie
s
who
was
laughing
at
something
mingled
in
a
merry
sound
like
the
chirping
of
birds
no
leave
me
alone
said
princess
mary
her
voice
sounded
so
serious
and
so
sad
that
the
chirping
of
the
birds
was
silenced
at
once
they
looked
at
the
beautiful
large
thoughtful
eyes
full
of
tears
and
of
thoughts
gazing
shiningly
and
imploringly
at
them
and
understood
that
it
was
useless
and
even
cruel
to
insist
at
least
change
your
coiffure
said
the
little
princess
didn
t
i
tell
you
she
went
on
turning
reproachfully
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
mary
s
is
a
face
which
such
a
coiffure
does
not
suit
in
the
least
not
in
the
least
please
change
it
leave
me
alone
please
leave
me
alone
it
is
all
quite
the
same
to
me
answered
a
voice
struggling
with
tears
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
the
little
princess
had
to
own
to
themselves
that
princess
mary
in
this
guise
looked
very
plain
worse
than
usual
but
it
was
too
late
she
was
looking
at
them
with
an
expression
they
both
knew
an
expression
thoughtful
and
sad
this
expression
in
princess
mary
did
not
frighten
them
she
never
inspired
fear
in
anyone
but
they
knew
that
when
it
appeared
on
her
face
she
became
mute
and
was
not
to
be
shaken
in
her
determination
you
will
change
it
won
t
you
said
lise
and
as
princess
mary
gave
no
answer
she
left
the
room
princess
mary
was
left
alone
she
did
not
comply
with
lise
s
request
she
not
only
left
her
hair
as
it
was
but
did
not
even
look
in
her
glass
letting
her
arms
fall
helplessly
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
and
pondered
a
husband
a
man
a
strong
dominant
and
strangely
attractive
being
rose
in
her
imagination
and
carried
her
into
a
totally
different
happy
world
of
his
own
she
fancied
a
child
her
own
such
as
she
had
seen
the
day
before
in
the
arms
of
her
nurse
s
daughter
at
her
own
breast
the
husband
standing
by
and
gazing
tenderly
at
her
and
the
child
but
no
it
is
impossible
i
am
too
ugly
she
thought
please
come
to
tea
the
prince
will
be
out
in
a
moment
came
the
maid
s
voice
at
the
door
she
roused
herself
and
felt
appalled
at
what
she
had
been
thinking
and
before
going
down
she
went
into
the
room
where
the
icons
hung
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
dark
face
of
a
large
icon
of
the
saviour
lit
by
a
lamp
she
stood
before
it
with
folded
hands
for
a
few
moments
a
painful
doubt
filled
her
soul
could
the
joy
of
love
of
earthly
love
for
a
man
be
for
her
in
her
thoughts
of
marriage
princess
mary
dreamed
of
happiness
and
of
children
but
her
strongest
most
deeply
hidden
longing
was
for
earthly
love
the
more
she
tried
to
hide
this
feeling
from
others
and
even
from
herself
the
stronger
it
grew
o
god
she
said
how
am
i
to
stifle
in
my
heart
these
temptations
of
the
devil
how
am
i
to
renounce
forever
these
vile
fancies
so
as
peacefully
to
fulfill
thy
will
and
scarcely
had
she
put
that
question
than
god
gave
her
the
answer
in
her
own
heart
desire
nothing
for
thyself
seek
nothing
be
not
anxious
or
envious
man
s
future
and
thy
own
fate
must
remain
hidden
from
thee
but
live
so
that
thou
mayest
be
ready
for
anything
if
it
be
god
s
will
to
prove
thee
in
the
duties
of
marriage
be
ready
to
fulfill
his
will
with
this
consoling
thought
but
yet
with
a
hope
for
the
fulfillment
of
her
forbidden
earthly
longing
princess
mary
sighed
and
having
crossed
herself
went
down
thinking
neither
of
her
gown
and
coiffure
nor
of
how
she
would
go
in
nor
of
what
she
would
say
what
could
all
that
matter
in
comparison
with
the
will
of
god
without
whose
care
not
a
hair
of
man
s
head
can
fall
chapter
iv
when
princess
mary
came
down
prince
vasili
and
his
son
were
already
in
the
drawing
room
talking
to
the
little
princess
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
when
she
entered
with
her
heavy
step
treading
on
her
heels
the
gentlemen
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
rose
and
the
little
princess
indicating
her
to
the
gentlemen
said
voila
marie
princess
mary
saw
them
all
and
saw
them
in
detail
she
saw
prince
vasili
s
face
serious
for
an
instant
at
the
sight
of
her
but
immediately
smiling
again
and
the
little
princess
curiously
noting
the
impression
marie
produced
on
the
visitors
and
she
saw
mademoiselle
bourienne
with
her
ribbon
and
pretty
face
and
her
unusually
animated
look
which
was
fixed
on
him
but
him
she
could
not
see
she
only
saw
something
large
brilliant
and
handsome
moving
toward
her
as
she
entered
the
room
prince
vasili
approached
first
and
she
kissed
the
bold
forehead
that
bent
over
her
hand
and
answered
his
question
by
saying
that
on
the
contrary
she
remembered
him
quite
well
then
anatole
came
up
to
her
she
still
could
not
see
him
she
only
felt
a
soft
hand
taking
hers
firmly
and
she
touched
with
her
lips
a
white
forehead
over
which
was
beautiful
light
brown
hair
smelling
of
pomade
when
she
looked
up
at
him
she
was
struck
by
his
beauty
anatole
stood
with
his
right
thumb
under
a
button
of
his
uniform
his
chest
expanded
and
his
back
drawn
in
slightly
swinging
one
foot
and
with
his
head
a
little
bent
looked
with
beaming
face
at
the
princess
without
speaking
and
evidently
not
thinking
about
her
at
all
anatole
was
not
quick
witted
nor
ready
or
eloquent
in
conversation
but
he
had
the
faculty
so
invaluable
in
society
of
composure
and
imperturbable
self
possession
if
a
man
lacking
in
self
confidence
remains
dumb
on
a
first
introduction
and
betrays
a
consciousness
of
the
impropriety
of
such
silence
and
an
anxiety
to
find
something
to
say
the
effect
is
bad
but
anatole
was
dumb
swung
his
foot
and
smilingly
examined
the
princess
hair
it
was
evident
that
he
could
be
silent
in
this
way
for
a
very
long
time
if
anyone
finds
this
silence
inconvenient
let
him
talk
but
i
don
t
want
to
he
seemed
to
say
besides
this
in
his
behavior
to
women
anatole
had
a
manner
which
particularly
inspires
in
them
curiosity
awe
and
even
love
a
supercilious
consciousness
of
his
own
superiority
it
was
as
if
he
said
to
them
i
know
you
i
know
you
but
why
should
i
bother
about
you
you
d
be
only
too
glad
of
course
perhaps
he
did
not
really
think
this
when
he
met
women
even
probably
he
did
not
for
in
general
he
thought
very
little
but
his
looks
and
manner
gave
that
impression
the
princess
felt
this
and
as
if
wishing
to
show
him
that
she
did
not
even
dare
expect
to
interest
him
she
turned
to
his
father
the
conversation
was
general
and
animated
thanks
to
princess
lise
s
voice
and
little
downy
lip
that
lifted
over
her
white
teeth
she
met
prince
vasili
with
that
playful
manner
often
employed
by
lively
chatty
people
and
consisting
in
the
assumption
that
between
the
person
they
so
address
and
themselves
there
are
some
semi
private
long
established
jokes
and
amusing
reminiscences
though
no
such
reminiscences
really
exist
just
as
none
existed
in
this
case
prince
vasili
readily
adopted
her
tone
and
the
little
princess
also
drew
anatole
whom
she
hardly
knew
into
these
amusing
recollections
of
things
that
had
never
occurred
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
shared
them
and
even
princess
mary
felt
herself
pleasantly
made
to
share
in
these
merry
reminiscences
here
at
least
we
shall
have
the
benefit
of
your
company
all
to
ourselves
dear
prince
said
the
little
princess
of
course
in
french
to
prince
vasili
it
s
not
as
at
annette
s
receptions
where
you
always
ran
away
you
remember
cette
chere
annette
anna
pavlovna
ah
but
you
won
t
talk
politics
to
me
like
annette
and
our
little
tea
table
oh
yes
why
is
it
you
were
never
at
annette
s
the
little
princess
asked
anatole
ah
i
know
i
know
she
said
with
a
sly
glance
your
brother
hippolyte
told
me
about
your
goings
on
oh
and
she
shook
her
finger
at
him
i
have
even
heard
of
your
doings
in
paris
and
didn
t
hippolyte
tell
you
asked
prince
vasili
turning
to
his
son
and
seizing
the
little
princess
arm
as
if
she
would
have
run
away
and
he
had
just
managed
to
catch
her
didn
t
he
tell
you
how
he
himself
was
pining
for
the
dear
princess
and
how
she
showed
him
the
door
oh
she
is
a
pearl
among
women
princess
he
added
turning
to
princess
mary
when
paris
was
mentioned
mademoiselle
bourienne
for
her
part
seized
the
opportunity
of
joining
in
the
general
current
of
recollections
she
took
the
liberty
of
inquiring
whether
it
was
long
since
anatole
had
left
paris
and
how
he
had
liked
that
city
anatole
answered
the
frenchwoman
very
readily
and
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
talked
to
her
about
her
native
land
when
he
saw
the
pretty
little
bourienne
anatole
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
not
find
bald
hills
dull
either
not
at
all
bad
he
thought
examining
her
not
at
all
bad
that
little
companion
i
hope
she
will
bring
her
along
with
her
when
we
re
married
la
petite
est
gentille
the
little
one
is
charming
the
old
prince
dressed
leisurely
in
his
study
frowning
and
considering
what
he
was
to
do
the
coming
of
these
visitors
annoyed
him
what
are
prince
vasili
and
that
son
of
his
to
me
prince
vasili
is
a
shallow
braggart
and
his
son
no
doubt
is
a
fine
specimen
he
grumbled
to
himself
what
angered
him
was
that
the
coming
of
these
visitors
revived
in
his
mind
an
unsettled
question
he
always
tried
to
stifle
one
about
which
he
always
deceived
himself
the
question
was
whether
he
could
ever
bring
himself
to
part
from
his
daughter
and
give
her
to
a
husband
the
prince
never
directly
asked
himself
that
question
knowing
beforehand
that
he
would
have
to
answer
it
justly
and
justice
clashed
not
only
with
his
feelings
but
with
the
very
possibility
of
life
life
without
princess
mary
little
as
he
seemed
to
value
her
was
unthinkable
to
him
and
why
should
she
marry
he
thought
to
be
unhappy
for
certain
there
s
lise
married
to
andrew
a
better
husband
one
would
think
could
hardly
be
found
nowadays
but
is
she
contented
with
her
lot
and
who
would
marry
marie
for
love
plain
and
awkward
they
ll
take
her
for
her
connections
and
wealth
are
there
no
women
living
unmarried
and
even
the
happier
for
it
so
thought
prince
bolkonski
while
dressing
and
yet
the
question
he
was
always
putting
off
demanded
an
immediate
answer
prince
vasili
had
brought
his
son
with
the
evident
intention
of
proposing
and
today
or
tomorrow
he
would
probably
ask
for
an
answer
his
birth
and
position
in
society
were
not
bad
well
i
ve
nothing
against
it
the
prince
said
to
himself
but
he
must
be
worthy
of
her
and
that
is
what
we
shall
see
that
is
what
we
shall
see
that
is
what
we
shall
see
he
added
aloud
he
entered
the
drawing
room
with
his
usual
alert
step
glancing
rapidly
round
the
company
he
noticed
the
change
in
the
little
princess
dress
mademoiselle
bourienne
s
ribbon
princess
mary
s
unbecoming
coiffure
mademoiselle
bourienne
s
and
anatole
s
smiles
and
the
loneliness
of
his
daughter
amid
the
general
conversation
got
herself
up
like
a
fool
he
thought
looking
irritably
at
her
she
is
shameless
and
he
ignores
her
he
went
straight
up
to
prince
vasili
well
how
d
ye
do
how
d
ye
do
glad
to
see
you
friendship
laughs
at
distance
began
prince
vasili
in
his
usual
rapid
self
confident
familiar
tone
here
is
my
second
son
please
love
and
befriend
him
prince
bolkonski
surveyed
anatole
fine
young
fellow
fine
young
fellow
he
said
well
come
and
kiss
me
and
he
offered
his
cheek
anatole
kissed
the
old
man
and
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
and
perfect
composure
waiting
for
a
display
of
the
eccentricities
his
father
had
told
him
to
expect
prince
bolkonski
sat
down
in
his
usual
place
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
drawing
up
an
armchair
for
prince
vasili
pointed
to
it
and
began
questioning
him
about
political
affairs
and
news
he
seemed
to
listen
attentively
to
what
prince
vasili
said
but
kept
glancing
at
princess
mary
and
so
they
are
writing
from
potsdam
already
he
said
repeating
prince
vasili
s
last
words
then
rising
he
suddenly
went
up
to
his
daughter
is
it
for
visitors
you
ve
got
yourself
up
like
that
eh
said
he
fine
very
fine
you
have
done
up
your
hair
in
this
new
way
for
the
visitors
and
before
the
visitors
i
tell
you
that
in
future
you
are
never
to
dare
to
change
your
way
of
dress
without
my
consent
it
was
my
fault
mon
pere
interceded
the
little
princess
with
a
blush
you
must
do
as
you
please
said
prince
bolkonski
bowing
to
his
daughter
in
law
but
she
need
not
make
a
fool
of
herself
she
s
plain
enough
as
it
is
and
he
sat
down
again
paying
no
more
attention
to
his
daughter
who
was
reduced
to
tears
on
the
contrary
that
coiffure
suits
the
princess
very
well
said
prince
vasili
now
you
young
prince
what
s
your
name
said
prince
bolkonski
turning
to
anatole
come
here
let
us
talk
and
get
acquainted
now
the
fun
begins
thought
anatole
sitting
down
with
a
smile
beside
the
old
prince

asked
the
old
man
scrutinizing
anatole
closely
and
intently

line
said
anatole
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
laughter

thing

dear
boy

to
his
father
with
a
laugh
a
splendid
soldier
splendid
what
am
i
attached
to
ha

ha
laughed
prince
bolkonski
and
anatole
laughed
still
louder
suddenly
prince
bolkonski
frowned

he
said
to
anatole
anatole
returned
smiling
to
the
ladies
and
so
you
ve
had

educated
abroad

the
old
prince
to

best

and
i

he
took
prince
vasili
s
arm
and
led
him
to
his
study
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
prince
vasili
announced
his
hopes
and
wishes
to
the
old
prince
well
do
you
think
i
shall
prevent
her

angrily

screamed
in
the
same
piercing
tone
as
when
parting
from
his
son
i
will
tell
you
frankly
said
prince
vasili
in
the
tone
of
a
crafty
man
convinced
of
the
futility
of
being
cunning
with
so
keen
sighted
a
companion
you
know
you
see
right
through
people
anatole
is
no
genius
but
he
is
an
honest
goodhearted
lad
an
excellent
son
or
kinsman
all
right
all
right
we
ll
see
as
always
happens
when
women
lead
lonely
lives
for
any
length
of
time
without
male
society
on
anatole
s
appearance
all
the
three
women
of
prince
bolkonski
s
household
felt
that
their
life
had
not
been
real
till
then
their
powers
of
reasoning
feeling
and
observing
immediately
increased
tenfold
and
their
life
which
seemed
to
have
been
passed
in
darkness
was
suddenly
lit
up
by
a
new
brightness
full
of
significance
princess
mary
grew
quite
unconscious
of
her
face
and
coiffure
the
handsome
open
face
of
the
man
who
might
perhaps
be
her
husband
absorbed
all
her
attention
he
seemed
to
her
kind
brave
determined
manly
and
magnanimous
she
felt
convinced
of
that
thousands
of
dreams
of
a
future
family
life
continually
rose
in
her
imagination
she
drove
them
away
and
tried
to
conceal
them
but
am
i
not
too
cold
with
him
thought
the
princess
i
try
to
be
reserved
because
in
the
depth
of
my
soul
i
feel
too
near
to
him
already
but
then
he
cannot
know
what
i
think
of
him
and
may
imagine
that
i
do
not
like
him
and
princess
mary
tried
but
could
not
manage
to
be
cordial
to
her
new
guest
poor
girl
she
s
devilish
ugly
thought
anatole
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
roused
to
great
excitement
by
anatole
s
arrival
thought
in
another
way
of
course
she
a
handsome
young
woman
without
any
definite
position
without
relations
or
even
a
country
did
not
intend
to
devote
her
life
to
serving
prince
bolkonski
to
reading
aloud
to
him
and
being
friends
with
princess
mary
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
long
been
waiting
for
a
russian
prince
who
able
to
appreciate
at
a
glance
her
superiority
to
the
plain
badly
dressed
ungainly
russian
princesses
would
fall
in
love
with
her
and
carry
her
off
and
here
at
last
was
a
russian
prince
mademoiselle
bourienne
knew
a
story
heard
from
her
aunt
but
finished
in
her
own
way
which
she
liked
to
repeat
to
herself
it
was
the
story
of
a
girl
who
had
been
seduced
and
to
whom
her
poor
mother
sa
pauvre
mere
appeared
and
reproached
her
for
yielding
to
a
man
without
being
married
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
often
touched
to
tears
as
in
imagination
she
told
this
story
to
him
her
seducer
and
now
he
a
real
russian
prince
had
appeared
he
would
carry
her
away
and
then
sa
pauvre
mere
would
appear
and
he
would
marry
her
so
her
future
shaped
itself
in
mademoiselle
bourienne
s
head
at
the
very
time
she
was
talking
to
anatole
about
paris
it
was
not
calculation
that
guided
her
she
did
not
even
for
a
moment
consider
what
she
should
do
but
all
this
had
long
been
familiar
to
her
and
now
that
anatole
had
appeared
it
just
grouped
itself
around
him
and
she
wished
and
tried
to
please
him
as
much
as
possible
the
little
princess
like
an
old
war
horse
that
hears
the
trumpet
unconsciously
and
quite
forgetting
her
condition
prepared
for
the
familiar
gallop
of
coquetry
without
any
ulterior
motive
or
any
struggle
but
with
naive
and
lighthearted
gaiety
although
in
female
society
anatole
usually
assumed
the
role
of
a
man
tired
of
being
run
after
by
women
his
vanity
was
flattered
by
the
spectacle
of
his
power
over
these
three
women
besides
that
he
was
beginning
to
feel
for
the
pretty
and
provocative
mademoiselle
bourienne
that
passionate
animal
feeling
which
was
apt
to
master
him
with
great
suddenness
and
prompt
him
to
the
coarsest
and
most
reckless
actions
after
tea
the
company
went
into
the
sitting
room
and
princess
mary
was
asked
to
play
on
the
clavichord
anatole
laughing
and
in
high
spirits
came
and
leaned
on
his
elbows
facing
her
and
beside
mademoiselle
bourienne
princess
mary
felt
his
look
with
a
painfully
joyous
emotion
her
favorite
sonata
bore
her
into
a
most
intimately
poetic
world
and
the
look
she
felt
upon
her
made
that
world
still
more
poetic
but
anatole
s
expression
though
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
referred
not
to
her
but
to
the
movements
of
mademoiselle
bourienne
s
little
foot
which
he
was
then
touching
with
his
own
under
the
clavichord
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
also
looking
at
princess
mary
and
in
her
lovely
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
fearful
joy
and
hope
that
was
also
new
to
the
princess
how
she
loves
me
thought
princess
mary
how
happy
i
am
now
and
how
happy
i
may
be
with
such
a
friend
and
such
a
husband
husband
can
it
be
possible
she
thought
not
daring
to
look
at
his
face
but
still
feeling
his
eyes
gazing
at
her
in
the
evening
after
supper
when
all
were
about
to
retire
anatole
kissed
princess
mary
s
hand
she
did
not
know
how
she
found
the
courage
but
she
looked
straight
into
his
handsome
face
as
it
came
near
to
her
shortsighted
eyes
turning
from
princess
mary
he
went
up
and
kissed
mademoiselle
bourienne
s
hand
this
was
not
etiquette
but
then
he
did
everything
so
simply
and
with
such
assurance
mademoiselle
bourienne
flushed
and
gave
the
princess
a
frightened
look
what
delicacy
thought
the
princess
is
it
possible
that
amelie
mademoiselle
bourienne
thinks
i
could
be
jealous
of
her
and
not
value
her
pure
affection
and
devotion
to
me
she
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
warmly
anatole
went
up
to
kiss
the
little
princess
hand
no
no
no
when
your
father
writes
to
tell
me
that
you
are
behaving
well
i
will
give
you
my
hand
to
kiss
not
till
then
she
said
and
smilingly
raising
a
finger
at
him
she
left
the
room
chapter
v
they
all
separated
but
except
anatole
who
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
he
got
into
bed
all
kept
awake
a
long
time
that
night
is
he
really
to
be
my
husband
this
stranger
who
is
so
kind
yes
kind
that
is
the
chief
thing
thought
princess
mary
and
fear
which
she
had
seldom
experienced
came
upon
her
she
feared
to
look
round
it
seemed
to
her
that
someone
was
there
standing
behind
the
screen
in
the
dark
corner
and
this
someone
was
he
the
devil
and
he
was
also
this
man
with
the
white
forehead
black
eyebrows
and
red
lips
she
rang
for
her
maid
and
asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
room
mademoiselle
bourienne
walked
up
and
down
the
conservatory
for
a
long
time
that
evening
vainly
expecting
someone
now
smiling
at
someone
now
working
herself
up
to
tears
with
the
imaginary
words
of
her
pauvre
mere
rebuking
her
for
her
fall
the
little
princess
grumbled
to
her
maid
that
her
bed
was
badly
made
she
could
not
lie
either
on
her
face
or
on
her
side
every
position
was
awkward
and
uncomfortable
and
her
burden
oppressed
her
now
more
than
ever
because
anatole
s
presence
had
vividly
recalled
to
her
the
time
when
she
was
not
like
that
and
when
everything
was
light
and
gay
she
sat
in
an
armchair
in
her
dressing
jacket
and
nightcap
and
katie
sleepy
and
disheveled
beat
and
turned
the
heavy
feather
bed
for
the
third
time
muttering
to
herself
i
told
you
it
was
all
lumps
and
holes
the
little
princess
repeated
i
should
be
glad
enough
to
fall
asleep
so
it
s
not
my
fault
and
her
voice
quivered
like
that
of
a
child
about
to
cry
the
old
prince
did
not
sleep
either
tikhon
half
asleep
heard
him
pacing
angrily
about
and
snorting
the
old
prince
felt
as
though
he
had
been
insulted
through
his
daughter
the
insult
was
the
more
pointed
because
it
concerned
not
himself
but
another
his
daughter
whom
he
loved
more
than
himself
he
kept
telling
himself
that
he
would
consider
the
whole
matter
and
decide
what
was
right
and
how
he
should
act
but
instead
of
that
he
only
excited
himself
more
and
more
the
first
man
that
turns
up
she
forgets
her
father
and
everything
else
runs
upstairs
and
does
up
her
hair
and
wags
her
tail
and
is
unlike
herself
glad
to
throw
her
father
over
and
she
knew
i
should
notice
it
fr
fr
fr
and
don
t
i
see
that
that
idiot
had
eyes
only
for
bourienne
i
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
her
and
how
is
it
she
has
not
pride
enough
to
see
it
if
she
has
no
pride
for
herself
she
might
at
least
have
some
for
my
sake
she
must
be
shown
that
the
blockhead
thinks
nothing
of
her
and
looks
only
at
bourienne
no
she
has
no
pride
but
i
ll
let
her
see
the
old
prince
knew
that
if
he
told
his
daughter
she
was
making
a
mistake
and
that
anatole
meant
to
flirt
with
mademoiselle
bourienne
princess
mary
s
self
esteem
would
be
wounded
and
his
point
not
to
be
parted
from
her
would
be
gained
so
pacifying
himself
with
this
thought
he
called
tikhon
and
began
to
undress
what
devil
brought
them
here
thought
he
while
tikhon
was
putting
the
nightshirt
over
his
dried
up
old
body
and
gray
haired
chest
i
never
invited
them
they
came
to
disturb
my
life
and
there
is
not
much
of
it
left
devil
take
em
he
muttered
while
his
head
was
still
covered
by
the
shirt
tikhon
knew
his
master
s
habit
of
sometimes
thinking
aloud
and
therefore
met
with
unaltered
looks
the
angrily
inquisitive
expression
of
the
face
that
emerged
from
the
shirt
gone
to
bed
asked
the
prince
tikhon
like
all
good
valets
instinctively
knew
the
direction
of
his
master
s
thoughts
he
guessed
that
the
question
referred
to
prince
vasili
and
his
son
they
have
gone
to
bed
and
put
out
their
lights
your
excellency
no
good
no
good
said
the
prince
rapidly
and
thrusting
his
feet
into
his
slippers
and
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
his
dressing
gown
he
went
to
the
couch
on
which
he
slept
though
no
words
had
passed
between
anatole
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
they
quite
understood
one
another
as
to
the
first
part
of
their
romance
up
to
the
appearance
of
the
pauvre
mere
they
understood
that
they
had
much
to
say
to
one
another
in
private
and
so
they
had
been
seeking
an
opportunity
since
morning
to
meet
one
another
alone
when
princess
mary
went
to
her
father
s
room
at
the
usual
hour
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
anatole
met
in
the
conservatory
princess
mary
went
to
the
door
of
the
study
with
special
trepidation
it
seemed
to
her
that
not
only
did
everybody
know
that
her
fate
would
be
decided
that
day
but
that
they
also
knew
what
she
thought
about
it
she
read
this
in
tikhon
s
face
and
in
that
of
prince
vasili
s
valet
who
made
her
a
low
bow
when
she
met
him
in
the
corridor
carrying
hot
water
the
old
prince
was
very
affectionate
and
careful
in
his
treatment
of
his
daughter
that
morning
princess
mary
well
knew
this
painstaking
expression
of
her
father
s
his
face
wore
that
expression
when
his
dry
hands
clenched
with
vexation
at
her
not
understanding
a
sum
in
arithmetic
when
rising
from
his
chair
he
would
walk
away
from
her
repeating
in
a
low
voice
the
same
words
several
times
over
he
came
to
the
point
at
once
treating
her
ceremoniously
i
have
had
a
proposition
made
me
concerning
you
he
said
with
an
unnatural
smile
i
expect
you
have
guessed
that
prince
vasili
has
not
come
and
brought
his
pupil
with
him
for
some
reason
prince
bolkonski
referred
to
anatole
as
a
pupil
for
the
sake
of
my
beautiful
eyes
last
night
a
proposition
was
made
me
on
your
account
and
as
you
know
my
principles
i
refer
it
to
you
how
am
i
to
understand
you
mon
pere
said
the
princess
growing
pale
and
then
blushing
how
understand
me
cried
her
father
angrily
prince
vasili
finds
you
to
his
taste
as
a
daughter
in
law
and
makes
a
proposal
to
you
on
his
pupil
s
behalf
that
s
how
it
s
to
be
understood
how
understand
it
and
i
ask
you
i
do
not
know
what
you
think
father
whispered
the
princess
i
i
what
of
me
leave
me
out
of
the
question
i
m
not
going
to
get
married
what
about
you
that
s
what
i
want
to
know
the
princess
saw
that
her
father
regarded
the
matter
with
disapproval
but
at
that
moment
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
her
fate
would
be
decided
now
or
never
she
lowered
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
gaze
under
which
she
felt
that
she
could
not
think
but
would
only
be
able
to
submit
from
habit
and
she
said
i
wish
only
to
do
your
will
but
if
i
had
to
express
my
own
desire
she
had
no
time
to
finish
the
old
prince
interrupted
her
that
s
admirable
he
shouted
he
will
take
you
with
your
dowry
and
take
mademoiselle
bourienne
into
the
bargain
she
ll
be
the
wife
while
you
the
prince
stopped
he
saw
the
effect
these
words
had
produced
on
his
daughter
she
lowered
her
head
and
was
ready
to
burst
into
tears
now
then
now
then
i
m
only
joking
he
said
remember
this
princess
i
hold
to
the
principle
that
a
maiden
has
a
full
right
to
choose
i
give
you
freedom
only
remember
that
your
life
s
happiness
depends
on
your
decision
never
mind
me
but
i
do
not
know
father
there
s
no
need
to
talk
he
receives
his
orders
and
will
marry
you
or
anybody
but
you
are
free
to
choose
go
to
your
room
think
it
over
and
come
back
in
an
hour
and
tell
me
in
his
presence
yes
or
no
i
know
you
will
pray
over
it
well
pray
if
you
like
but
you
had
better
think
it
over
go
yes
or
no
yes
or
no
yes
or
no
he
still
shouted
when
the
princess
as
if
lost
in
a
fog
had
already
staggered
out
of
the
study
her
fate
was
decided
and
happily
decided
but
what
her
father
had
said
about
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
dreadful
it
was
untrue
to
be
sure
but
still
it
was
terrible
and
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
it
she
was
going
straight
on
through
the
conservatory
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
anything
when
suddenly
the
well
known
whispering
of
mademoiselle
bourienne
aroused
her
she
raised
her
eyes
and
two
steps
away
saw
anatole
embracing
the
frenchwoman
and
whispering
something
to
her
with
a
horrified
expression
on
his
handsome
face
anatole
looked
at
princess
mary
but
did
not
at
once
take
his
arm
from
the
waist
of
mademoiselle
bourienne
who
had
not
yet
seen
her
who
s
that
why
wait
a
moment
anatole
s
face
seemed
to
say
princess
mary
looked
at
them
in
silence
she
could
not
understand
it
at
last
mademoiselle
bourienne
gave
a
scream
and
ran
away
anatole
bowed
to
princess
mary
with
a
gay
smile
as
if
inviting
her
to
join
in
a
laugh
at
this
strange
incident
and
then
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
to
the
door
that
led
to
his
own
apartments
an
hour
later
tikhon
came
to
call
princess
mary
to
the
old
prince
he
added
that
prince
vasili
was
also
there
when
tikhon
came
to
her
princess
mary
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
her
room
holding
the
weeping
mademoiselle
bourienne
in
her
arms
and
gently
stroking
her
hair
the
princess
beautiful
eyes
with
all
their
former
calm
radiance
were
looking
with
tender
affection
and
pity
at
mademoiselle
bourienne
s
pretty
face
no
princess
i
have
lost
your
affection
forever
said
mademoiselle
bourienne
why
i
love
you
more
than
ever
said
princess
mary
and
i
will
try
to
do
all
i
can
for
your
happiness
but
you
despise
me
you
who
are
so
pure
can
never
understand
being
so
carried
away
by
passion
oh
only
my
poor
mother

she
said
and
went
out
prince
vasili
with
one
leg
thrown
high
over
the
other
and
a
snuffbox
in
his
hand
was
sitting
there
with
a
smile
of
deep
emotion
on
his
face
as
if
stirred
to
his
heart
s
core
and
himself
regretting
and
laughing
at
his
own
sensibility
when
princess
mary
entered
he
hurriedly
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
ah
my
dear
my
dear
he
began
rising
and
taking
her
by
both
hands
then
sighing
he
added

hands

dear
good
gentle
marie
whom
i
have
always

he
drew
back
and
a
real
tear
appeared
in
his
eye
fr

snorted

and
at

with
her
beautiful
eyes
humbug

cried
prince
bolkonski
frowning
and
taking
his
daughter
s
hand
he
did
not
kiss
her
but
only
bending
his
forehead
to
hers
just
touched
it
and
pressed
her
hand
so
that
she
winced
and
uttered
a
cry
prince
vasili
rose
my

i
must
tell

a
little
hope
of

this

so
kind
and
generous
say
perhaps
the

long

perhaps
prince
what
i
have
said
is
all
there
is
in
my
heart
i
thank

i
shall

said
the
old
prince
very
very
glad
to
have
seen
you
repeated
he
embracing
prince
vasili
my
vocation
is
a
different
one
thought
princess
mary
my
vocation
is
to
be
happy
with
another
kind
of
happiness
the
happiness
of
love
and
self
sacrifice
and
cost
what
it
may
i
will
arrange
poor
amelie
s
happiness
she
loves
him
so
passionately
and
so
passionately
repents
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
arrange
the
match
between
them
if
he
is
not
rich
i
will
give
her
the
means
i
will
ask
my
father
and
andrew
i
shall
be
so
happy
when
she
is
his
wife
she
is
so
unfortunate
a
stranger
alone
helpless
and
oh
god
how
passionately
she
must
love
him
if
she
could
so
far
forget
herself
perhaps
i
might
have
done
the
same
thought
princess

chapter
vi
it
was
long
since
the
rostovs
had
news
of
nicholas
not
till
midwinter
was
the
count
at
last
handed
a
letter
addressed
in
his
son
s
handwriting
on
receiving
it
he
ran
on
tiptoe
to
his
study
in
alarm
and
haste
trying
to
escape
notice
closed
the
door
and
began
to
read
the
letter
anna
mikhaylovna
who
always
knew
everything
that
passed
in
the
house
on
hearing
of
the
arrival
of
the
letter
went
softly
into
the
room
and
found
the
count
with
it
in
his
hand
sobbing
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
anna
mikhaylovna
though
her
circumstances
had
improved
was
still
living
with
the
rostovs
my
dear
friend
said
she
in
a
tone
of
pathetic
inquiry
prepared
to
sympathize
in
any
way
the
count
sobbed
yet
more
nikolenka
a
letter
wa
a
s
wounded
my
darling
boy
the
countess
promoted
to
be
an
officer
thank
god
how
tell
the
little
countess
anna
mikhaylovna
sat
down
beside
him
with
her
own
handkerchief
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
from
the
letter
then
having
dried
her
own
eyes
she
comforted
the
count
and
decided
that
at
dinner
and
till
teatime
she
would
prepare
the
countess
and
after
tea
with
god
s
help
would
inform
her
at
dinner
anna
mikhaylovna
talked
the
whole
time
about
the
war
news
and
about
nikolenka
twice
asked
when
the
last
letter
had
been
received
from
him
though
she
knew
that
already
and
remarked
that
they
might
very
likely
be
getting
a
letter
from
him
that
day
each
time
that
these
hints
began
to
make
the
countess
anxious
and
she
glanced
uneasily
at
the
count
and
at
anna
mikhaylovna
the
latter
very
adroitly
turned
the
conversation
to
insignificant
matters
natasha
who
of
the
whole
family
was
the
most
gifted
with
a
capacity
to
feel
any
shades
of
intonation
look
and
expression
pricked
up
her
ears
from
the
beginning
of
the
meal
and
was
certain
that
there
was
some
secret
between
her
father
and
anna
mikhaylovna
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
her
brother
and
that
anna
mikhaylovna
was
preparing
them
for
it
bold
as
she
was
natasha
who
knew
how
sensitive
her
mother
was
to
anything
relating
to
nikolenka
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
at
dinner
but
she
was
too
excited
to
eat
anything
and
kept
wriggling
about
on
her
chair
regardless
of
her
governess
remarks
after
dinner
she
rushed
headlong
after
anna
mikhaylovna
and
dashing
at
her
flung
herself
on
her
neck
as
soon
as
she
overtook
her
in
the
sitting
room
auntie
darling
do
tell
me
what
it
is
nothing
my
dear
no
dearest
sweet
one
honey
i
won
t
give
up
i
know
you
know
something
anna
mikhaylovna
shook
her
head
you
are
a
little
slyboots
she
said
a
letter
from
nikolenka
i
m
sure
of
it
exclaimed
natasha
reading
confirmation
in
anna
mikhaylovna
s
face
but
for
god
s
sake
be
careful
you
know
how
it
may
affect
your
mamma
i
will
i
will
only
tell
me
you
won
t
then
i
will
go
and
tell
at
once
anna
mikhaylovna
in
a
few
words
told
her
the
contents
of
the
letter
on
condition
that
she
should
tell
no
one
no
on
my
true
word
of
honor
said
natasha
crossing
herself
i
won
t
tell
anyone
and
she
ran
off
at
once
to
sonya
nikolenka
wounded
a
letter
she
announced
in
gleeful
triumph
nicholas
was
all
sonya
said
instantly
turning
white
natasha
seeing
the
impression
the
news
of
her
brother
s
wound
produced
on
sonya
felt
for
the
first
time
the
sorrowful
side
of
the
news
she
rushed
to
sonya
hugged
her
and
began
to
cry
a
little
wound
but
he
has
been
made
an
officer
he
is
well
now
he
wrote
himself
said
she
through
her
tears
there
now
it
s
true
that
all
you
women
are
crybabies
remarked
petya
pacing
the
room
with
large
resolute
strides
now
i
m
very
glad
very
glad
indeed
that
my
brother
has
distinguished
himself
so
you
are
all
blubberers
and
understand
nothing
natasha
smiled
through
her
tears
you
haven
t
read
the
letter
asked
sonya
no
but
she
said
that
it
was
all
over
and
that
he
s
now
an
officer
thank
god
said
sonya
crossing
herself
but
perhaps
she
deceived
you
let
us
go
to
mamma
petya
paced
the
room
in
silence
for
a
time
if
i
d
been
in
nikolenka
s
place
i
would
have
killed
even
more
of
those
frenchmen
he
said
what
nasty
brutes
they
are
i
d
have
killed
so
many
that
there
d
have
been
a
heap
of
them
hold
your
tongue
petya
what
a
goose
you
are
i
m
not
a
goose
but
they
are
who
cry
about
trifles
said
petya
do
you
remember
him
natasha
suddenly
asked
after
a
moment
s
silence
sonya
smiled
do
i
remember
nicholas
no
sonya
but
do
you
remember
so
that
you
remember
him
perfectly
remember
everything
said
natasha
with
an
expressive
gesture
evidently
wishing
to
give
her
words
a
very
definite
meaning
i
remember
nikolenka
too
i
remember
him
well
she
said
but
i
don
t
remember
boris
i
don
t
remember
him
a
bit
what
you
don
t
remember
boris
asked
sonya
in
surprise
it
s
not
that
i
don
t
remember
i
know
what
he
is
like
but
not
as
i
remember
nikolenka
him
i
just
shut
my
eyes
and
remember
but
boris
no
she
shut
her
eyes
no
there
s
nothing
at
all
oh
natasha
said
sonya
looking
ecstatically
and
earnestly
at
her
friend
as
if
she
did
not
consider
her
worthy
to
hear
what
she
meant
to
say
and
as
if
she
were
saying
it
to
someone
else
with
whom
joking
was
out
of
the
question
i
am
in
love
with
your
brother
once
for
all
and
whatever
may
happen
to
him
or
to
me
shall
never
cease
to
love
him
as
long
as
i
live
natasha
looked
at
sonya
with
wondering
and
inquisitive
eyes
and
said
nothing
she
felt
that
sonya
was
speaking
the
truth
that
there
was
such
love
as
sonya
was
speaking
of
but
natasha
had
not
yet
felt
anything
like
it
she
believed
it
could
be
but
did
not
understand
it
shall
you
write
to
him
she
asked
sonya
became
thoughtful
the
question
of
how
to
write
to
nicholas
and
whether
she
ought
to
write
tormented
her
now
that
he
was
already
an
officer
and
a
wounded
hero
would
it
be
right
to
remind
him
of
herself
and
as
it
might
seem
of
the
obligations
to
her
he
had
taken
on
himself
i
don
t
know
i
think
if
he
writes
i
will
write
too
she
said
blushing
and
you
won
t
feel
ashamed
to
write
to
him
sonya
smiled
no
and
i
should
be
ashamed
to
write
to
boris
i
m
not
going
to
why
should
you
be
ashamed
well
i
don
t
know
it
s
awkward
and
would
make
me
ashamed
and
i
know
why
she
d
be
ashamed
said
petya
offended
by
natasha
s
previous
remark
it
s
because
she
was
in
love
with
that
fat
one
in
spectacles
that
was
how
petya
described
his
namesake
the
new
count
bezukhov
and
now
she
s
in
love
with
that
singer
he
meant
natasha
s
italian
singing
master
that
s
why
she
s
ashamed
petya
you
re
a
stupid
said
natasha
not
more
stupid
than
you
madam
said
the
nine
year
old
petya
with
the
air
of
an
old
brigadier
the
countess
had
been
prepared
by
anna
mikhaylovna
s
hints
at
dinner
on
retiring
to
her
own
room
she
sat
in
an
armchair
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
miniature
portrait
of
her
son
on
the
lid
of
a
snuffbox
while
the
tears
kept
coming
into
her
eyes
anna
mikhaylovna
with
the
letter
came
on
tiptoe
to
the
countess
door
and
paused
don
t
come
in
she
said
to
the
old
count
who
was
following
her
come
later
and
she
went
in
closing
the
door
behind
her
the
count
put
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
listened
at
first
he
heard
the
sound
of
indifferent
voices
then
anna
mikhaylovna
s
voice
alone
in
a
long
speech
then
a
cry
then
silence
then
both
voices
together
with
glad
intonations
and
then
footsteps
anna
mikhaylovna
opened
the
door
her
face
wore
the
proud
expression
of
a
surgeon
who
has
just
performed
a
difficult
operation
and
admits
the
public
to
appreciate
his
skill
it
is
done
she
said
to
the
count
pointing
triumphantly
to
the
countess
who
sat
holding
in
one
hand
the
snuffbox
with
its
portrait
and
in
the
other
the
letter
and
pressing
them
alternately
to
her
lips
when
she
saw
the
count
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
embraced
his
bald
head
over
which
she
again
looked
at
the
letter
and
the
portrait
and
in
order
to
press
them
again
to
her
lips
she
slightly
pushed
away
the
bald
head
vera
natasha
sonya
and
petya
now
entered
the
room
and
the
reading
of
the
letter
began
after
a
brief
description
of
the
campaign
and
the
two
battles
in
which
he
had
taken
part
and
his
promotion
nicholas
said
that
he
kissed
his
father
s
and
mother
s
hands
asking
for
their
blessing
and
that
he
kissed
vera
natasha
and
petya
besides
that
he
sent
greetings
to
monsieur
schelling
madame
schoss
and
his
old
nurse
and
asked
them
to
kiss
for
him
dear
sonya
whom
he
loved
and
thought
of
just
the
same
as
ever
when
she
heard
this
sonya
blushed
so
that
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
unable
to
bear
the
looks
turned
upon
her
ran
away
into
the
dancing
hall
whirled
round
it
at
full
speed
with
her
dress
puffed
out
like
a
balloon
and
flushed
and
smiling
plumped
down
on
the
floor
the
countess
was
crying
why
are
you
crying
mamma
asked
vera
from
all
he
says
one
should
be
glad
and
not
cry
this
was
quite
true
but
the
count
the
countess
and
natasha
looked
at
her
reproachfully
and
who
is
it
she
takes
after
thought
the
countess
nicholas
letter
was
read
over
hundreds
of
times
and
those
who
were
considered
worthy
to
hear
it
had
to
come
to
the
countess
for
she
did
not
let
it
out
of
her
hands
the
tutors
came
and
the
nurses
and
dmitri
and
several
acquaintances
and
the
countess
reread
the
letter
each
time
with
fresh
pleasure
and
each
time
discovered
in
it
fresh
proofs
of
nikolenka
s
virtues
how
strange
how
extraordinary
how
joyful
it
seemed
that
her
son
the
scarcely
perceptible
motion
of
whose
tiny
limbs
she
had
felt
twenty
years
ago
within
her
that
son
about
whom
she
used
to
have
quarrels
with
the
too
indulgent
count
that
son
who
had
first
learned
to
say
pear
and
then
granny
that
this
son
should
now
be
away
in
a
foreign
land
amid
strange
surroundings
a
manly
warrior
doing
some
kind
of
man
s
work
of
his
own
without
help
or
guidance
the
universal
experience
of
ages
showing
that
children
do
grow
imperceptibly
from
the
cradle
to
manhood
did
not
exist
for
the
countess
her
son
s
growth
toward
manhood
at
each
of
its
stages
had
seemed
as
extraordinary
to
her
as
if
there
had
never
existed
the
millions
of
human
beings
who
grew
up
in
the
same
way
as
twenty
years
before
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
little
creature
who
lived
somewhere
under
her
heart
would
ever
cry
suck
her
breast
and
begin
to
speak
so
now
she
could
not
believe
that
that
little
creature
could
be
this
strong
brave
man
this
model
son
and
officer
that
judging
by
this
letter
he
now
was
what
a
style
how
charmingly
he
describes
said
she
reading
the
descriptive
part
of
the
letter
and
what
a
soul
not
a
word
about
himself
not
a
word
about
some
denisov
or
other
though
he
himself
i
dare
say
is
braver
than
any
of
them
he
says
nothing
about
his
sufferings
what
a
heart
how
like
him
it
is
and
how
he
has
remembered
everybody
not
forgetting
anyone
i
always
said
when
he
was
only
so
high
i
always
said
for
more
than
a
week
preparations
were
being
made
rough
drafts
of
letters
to
nicholas
from
all
the
household
were
written
and
copied
out
while
under
the
supervision
of
the
countess
and
the
solicitude
of
the
count
money
and
all
things
necessary
for
the
uniform
and
equipment
of
the
newly
commissioned
officer
were
collected
anna
mikhaylovna
practical
woman
that
she
was
had
even
managed
by
favor
with
army
authorities
to
secure
advantageous
means
of
communication
for
herself
and
her
son
she
had
opportunities
of
sending
her
letters
to
the
grand
duke
constantine
pavlovich
who
commanded
the
guards
the
rostovs
supposed
that
the
russian
guards
abroad
was
quite
a
definite
address
and
that
if
a
letter
reached
the
grand
duke
in
command
of
the
guards
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
not
reach
the
pavlograd
regiment
which
was
presumably
somewhere
in
the
same
neighborhood
and
so
it
was
decided
to
send
the
letters
and
money
by
the
grand
duke
s
courier
to
boris
and
boris
was
to
forward
them
to
nicholas
the
letters
were
from
the
old
count
the
countess
petya
vera
natasha
and
sonya
and
finally
there
were
six
thousand
rubles
for
his
outfit
and
various
other
things
the
old
count
sent
to
his
son
chapter
vii
on
the
twelfth
of
november
kutuzov
s
active
army
in
camp
before
olmutz
was
preparing
to
be
reviewed
next
day
by
the
two
emperors
the
russian
and
the
austrian
the
guards
just
arrived
from
russia
spent
the
night
ten
miles
from
olmutz
and
next
morning
were
to
come
straight
to
the
review
reaching
the
field
at
olmutz
by
ten
o
clock
that
day
nicholas
rostov
received
a
letter
from
boris
telling
him
that
the
ismaylov
regiment
was
quartered
for
the
night
ten
miles
from
olmutz
and
that
he
wanted
to
see
him
as
he
had
a
letter
and
money
for
him
rostov
was
particularly
in
need
of
money
now
that
the
troops
after
their
active
service
were
stationed
near
olmutz
and
the
camp
swarmed
with
well
provisioned
sutlers
and
austrian
jews
offering
all
sorts
of
tempting
wares
the
pavlograds
held
feast
after
feast
celebrating
awards
they
had
received
for
the
campaign
and
made
expeditions
to
olmutz
to
visit
a
certain
caroline
the
hungarian
who
had
recently
opened
a
restaurant
there
with
girls
as
waitresses
rostov
who
had
just
celebrated
his
promotion
to
a
cornetcy
and
bought
denisov
s
horse
bedouin
was
in
debt
all
round
to
his
comrades
and
the
sutlers
on
receiving
boris
letter
he
rode
with
a
fellow
officer
to
olmutz
dined
there
drank
a
bottle
of
wine
and
then
set
off
alone
to
the
guards
camp
to
find
his
old
playmate
rostov
had
not
yet
had
time
to
get
his
uniform
he
had
on
a
shabby
cadet
jacket
decorated
with
a
soldier
s
cross
equally
shabby
cadet
s
riding
breeches
lined
with
worn
leather
and
an
officer
s
saber
with
a
sword
knot
the
don
horse
he
was
riding
was
one
he
had
bought
from
a
cossack
during
the
campaign
and
he
wore
a
crumpled
hussar
cap
stuck
jauntily
back
on
one
side
of
his
head
as
he
rode
up
to
the
camp
he
thought
how
he
would
impress
boris
and
all
his
comrades
of
the
guards
by
his
appearance
that
of
a
fighting
hussar
who
had
been
under
fire
the
guards
had
made
their
whole
march
as
if
on
a
pleasure
trip
parading
their
cleanliness
and
discipline
they
had
come
by
easy
stages
their
knapsacks
conveyed
on
carts
and
the
austrian
authorities
had
provided
excellent
dinners
for
the
officers
at
every
halting
place
the
regiments
had
entered
and
left
the
town
with
their
bands
playing
and
by
the
grand
duke
s
orders
the
men
had
marched
all
the
way
in
step
a
practice
on
which
the
guards
prided
themselves
the
officers
on
foot
and
at
their
proper
posts
boris
had
been
quartered
and
had
marched
all
the
way
with
berg
who
was
already
in
command
of
a
company
berg
who
had
obtained
his
captaincy
during
the
campaign
had
gained
the
confidence
of
his
superiors
by
his
promptitude
and
accuracy
and
had
arranged
his
money
matters
very
satisfactorily
boris
during
the
campaign
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
persons
who
might
prove
useful
to
him
and
by
a
letter
of
recommendation
he
had
brought
from
pierre
had
become
acquainted
with
prince
andrew
bolkonski
through
whom
he
hoped
to
obtain
a
post
on
the
commander
in
chief
s
staff
berg
and
boris
having
rested
after
yesterday
s
march
were
sitting
clean
and
neatly
dressed
at
a
round
table
in
the
clean
quarters
allotted
to
them
playing
chess
berg
held
a
smoking
pipe
between
his
knees
boris
in
the
accurate
way
characteristic
of
him
was
building
a
little
pyramid
of
chessmen
with
his
delicate
white
fingers
while
awaiting
berg
s
move
and
watched
his
opponent
s
face
evidently
thinking
about
the
game
as
he
always
thought
only
of
whatever
he
was
engaged
on
well
how
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
that
he
remarked
we
ll
try
to
replied
berg
touching
a
pawn
and
then
removing
his
hand
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
here
he
is
at
last
shouted
rostov
and
berg
too
oh
you
petisenfans
allay
cushay
dormir
he
exclaimed
imitating
his
russian
nurse
s
french
at
which
he
and
boris
used
to
laugh
long
ago
dear
me
how
you
have
changed
boris
rose
to
meet
rostov
but
in
doing
so
did
not
omit
to
steady
and
replace
some
chessmen
that
were
falling
he
was
about
to
embrace
his
friend
but
nicholas
avoided
him
with
that
peculiar
feeling
of
youth
that
dread
of
beaten
tracks
and
wish
to
express
itself
in
a
manner
different
from
that
of
its
elders
which
is
often
insincere
nicholas
wished
to
do
something
special
on
meeting
his
friend
he
wanted
to
pinch
him
push
him
do
anything
but
kiss
him
a
thing
everybody
did
but
notwithstanding
this
boris
embraced
him
in
a
quiet
friendly
way
and
kissed
him
three
times
they
had
not
met
for
nearly
half
a
year
and
being
at
the
age
when
young
men
take
their
first
steps
on
life
s
road
each
saw
immense
changes
in
the
other
quite
a
new
reflection
of
the
society
in
which
they
had
taken
those
first
steps
both
had
changed
greatly
since
they
last
met
and
both
were
in
a
hurry
to
show
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
them
oh
you
damned
dandies
clean
and
fresh
as
if
you
d
been
to
a
fete
not
like
us
sinners
of
the
line
cried
rostov
with
martial
swagger
and
with
baritone
notes
in
his
voice
new
to
boris
pointing
to
his
own
mud
bespattered
breeches
the
german
landlady
hearing
rostov
s
loud
voice
popped
her
head
in
at
the
door
eh
is
she
pretty
he
asked
with
a
wink
why
do
you
shout
so
you
ll
frighten
them
said
boris
i
did
not
expect
you
today
he
added
i
only
sent
you
the
note
yesterday
by
bolkonski
an
adjutant
of
kutuzov
s
who
s
a
friend
of
mine
i
did
not
think
he
would
get
it
to
you
so
quickly
well
how
are
you
been
under
fire
already
asked
boris
without
answering
rostov
shook
the
soldier
s
cross
of
st
george
fastened
to
the
cording
of
his
uniform
and
indicating
a
bandaged
arm
glanced
at
berg
with
a
smile
as
you
see
he
said
indeed
yes
yes
said
boris
with
a
smile
and
we
too
have
had
a
splendid
march
you
know
of
course
that
his
imperial
highness
rode
with
our
regiment
all
the
time
so
that
we
had
every
comfort
and
every
advantage
what
receptions
we
had
in
poland
what
dinners
and
balls
i
can
t
tell
you
and
the
tsarevich
was
very
gracious
to
all
our
officers
and
the
two
friends
told
each
other
of
their
doings
the
one
of
his
hussar
revels
and
life
in
the
fighting
line
the
other
of
the
pleasures
and
advantages
of
service
under
members
of
the
imperial
family
oh
you
guards
said
rostov
i
say
send
for
some
wine
boris
made
a
grimace
if
you
really
want
it
said
he
he
went
to
his
bed
drew
a
purse
from
under
the
clean
pillow
and
sent
for
wine
yes
and
i
have
some
money
and
a
letter
to
give
you
he
added
rostov
took
the
letter
and
throwing
the
money
on
the
sofa
put
both
arms
on
the
table
and
began
to
read
after
reading
a
few
lines
he
glanced
angrily
at
berg
then
meeting
his
eyes
hid
his
face
behind
the
letter
well
they
ve
sent
you
a
tidy
sum
said
berg
eying
the
heavy
purse
that
sank
into
the
sofa
as
for
us
count
we
get
along
on
our
pay
i
can
tell
you
for
myself
i
say
berg
my
dear
fellow
said
rostov
when
you
get
a
letter
from
home
and
meet
one
of
your
own
people
whom
you
want
to
talk
everything
over
with
and
i
happen
to
be
there
i
ll
go
at
once
to
be
out
of
your
way
do
go
somewhere
anywhere
to
the
devil
he
exclaimed
and
immediately
seizing
him
by
the
shoulder
and
looking
amiably
into
his
face
evidently
wishing
to
soften
the
rudeness
of
his
words
he
added
don
t
be
hurt
my
dear
fellow
you
know
i
speak
from
my
heart
as
to
an
old
acquaintance
oh
don
t
mention
it
count
i
quite
understand
said
berg
getting
up
and
speaking
in
a
muffled
and
guttural
voice
go
across
to
our
hosts
they
invited
you
added
boris
berg
put
on
the
cleanest
of
coats
without
a
spot
or
speck
of
dust
stood
before
a
looking
glass
and
brushed
the
hair
on
his
temples
upwards
in
the
way
affected
by
the
emperor
alexander
and
having
assured
himself
from
the
way
rostov
looked
at
it
that
his
coat
had
been
noticed
left
the
room
with
a
pleasant
smile
oh
dear
what
a
beast
i
am
muttered
rostov
as
he
read
the
letter
why
oh
what
a
pig
i
am
not
to
have
written
and
to
have
given
them
such
a
fright
oh
what
a
pig
i
am
he
repeated
flushing
suddenly
well
have
you
sent
gabriel
for
some
wine
all
right
let
s
have
some
in
the
letter
from
his
parents
was
enclosed
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
bagration
which
the
old
countess
at
anna
mikhaylovna
s
advice
had
obtained
through
an
acquaintance
and
sent
to
her
son
asking
him
to
take
it
to
its
destination
and
make
use
of
it
what
nonsense
much
i
need
it
said
rostov
throwing
the
letter
under
the
table
why
have
you
thrown
that
away
asked
boris
it
is
some
letter
of
recommendation
what
the
devil
do
i
want
it
for
why
what
the
devil
said
boris
picking
it
up
and
reading
the
address
this
letter
would
be
of
great
use
to
you
i
want
nothing
and
i
won
t
be
anyone
s
adjutant
why
not
inquired
boris
it
s
a
lackey
s
job
you
are
still
the
same
dreamer
i
see
remarked
boris
shaking
his
head
and
you
re
still
the
same
diplomatist
but
that
s
not
the
point
come
how
are
you
asked
rostov
well
as
you
see
so
far
everything
s
all
right
but
i
confess
i
should
much
like
to
be
an
adjutant
and
not
remain
at
the
front
why
because
when
once
a
man
starts
on
military
service
he
should
try
to
make
as
successful
a
career
of
it
as
possible
oh
that
s
it
said
rostov
evidently
thinking
of
something
else
he
looked
intently
and
inquiringly
into
his
friend
s
eyes
evidently
trying
in
vain
to
find
the
answer
to
some
question
old
gabriel
brought
in
the
wine
shouldn
t
we
now
send
for
berg
asked
boris
he
would
drink
with
you
i
can
t
well
send
for
him
and
how
do
you
get
on
with
that
german
asked
rostov
with
a
contemptuous
smile
he
is
a
very
very
nice
honest
and
pleasant
fellow
answered
boris
again
rostov
looked
intently
into
boris
eyes
and
sighed
berg
returned
and
over
the
bottle
of
wine
conversation
between
the
three
officers
became
animated
the
guardsmen
told
rostov
of
their
march
and
how
they
had
been
made
much
of
in
russia
poland
and
abroad
they
spoke
of
the
sayings
and
doings
of
their
commander
the
grand
duke
and
told
stories
of
his
kindness
and
irascibility
berg
as
usual
kept
silent
when
the
subject
did
not
relate
to
himself
but
in
connection
with
the
stories
of
the
grand
duke
s
quick
temper
he
related
with
gusto
how
in
galicia
he
had
managed
to
deal
with
the
grand
duke
when
the
latter
made
a
tour
of
the
regiments
and
was
annoyed
at
the
irregularity
of
a
movement
with
a
pleasant
smile
berg
related
how
the
grand
duke
had
ridden
up
to
him
in
a
violent
passion
shouting
arnauts
arnauts
was
the
tsarevich
s
favorite
expression
when
he
was
in
a
rage
and
called
for
the
company
commander
would
you
believe
it
count
i
was
not
at
all
alarmed
because
i
knew
i
was
right
without
boasting
you
know
i
may
say
that
i
know
the
army
orders
by
heart
and
know
the
regulations
as
well
as
i
do
the
lord
s
prayer
so
count
there
never
is
any
negligence
in
my
company
and
so
my
conscience
was
at
ease
i
came
forward
berg
stood
up
and
showed
how
he
presented
himself
with
his
hand
to
his
cap
and
really
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
a
face
to
express
greater
respect
and
self
complacency
than
his
did
well
he
stormed
at
me
as
the
saying
is
stormed
and
stormed
and
stormed
it
was
not
a
matter
of
life
but
rather
of
death
as
the
saying
is
albanians
and
devils
and
to
siberia
said
berg
with
a
sagacious
smile
i
knew
i
was
in
the
right
so
i
kept
silent
was
not
that
best
count
hey
are
you
dumb
he
shouted
still
i
remained
silent
and
what
do
you
think
count
the
next
day
it
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the
orders
of
the
day
that
s
what
keeping
one
s
head
means
that
s
the
way
count
said
berg
lighting
his
pipe
and
emitting
rings
of
smoke
yes
that
was
fine
said
rostov
smiling
but
boris
noticed
that
he
was
preparing
to
make
fun
of
berg
and
skillfully
changed
the
subject
he
asked
him
to
tell
them
how
and
where
he
got
his
wound
this
pleased
rostov
and
he
began
talking
about
it
and
as
he
went
on
became
more
and
more
animated
he
told
them
of
his
schon
grabern
affair
just
as
those
who
have
taken
part
in
a
battle
generally
do
describe
it
that
is
as
they
would
like
it
to
have
been
as
they
have
heard
it
described
by
others
and
as
sounds
well
but
not
at
all
as
it
really
was
rostov
was
a
truthful
young
man
and
would
on
no
account
have
told
a
deliberate
lie
he
began
his
story
meaning
to
tell
everything
just
as
it
happened
but
imperceptibly
involuntarily
and
inevitably
he
lapsed
into
falsehood
if
he
had
told
the
truth
to
his
hearers
who
like
himself
had
often
heard
stories
of
attacks
and
had
formed
a
definite
idea
of
what
an
attack
was
and
were
expecting
to
hear
just
such
a
story
they
would
either
not
have
believed
him
or
still
worse
would
have
thought
that
rostov
was
himself
to
blame
since
what
generally
happens
to
the
narrators
of
cavalry
attacks
had
not
happened
to
him
he
could
not
tell
them
simply
that
everyone
went
at
a
trot
and
that
he
fell
off
his
horse
and
sprained
his
arm
and
then
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
from
a
frenchman
into
the
wood
besides
to
tell
everything
as
it
really
happened
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
make
an
effort
of
will
to
tell
only
what
happened
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
the
truth
and
young
people
are
rarely
capable
of
it
his
hearers
expected
a
story
of
how
beside
himself
and
all
aflame
with
excitement
he
had
flown
like
a
storm
at
the
square
cut
his
way
in
slashed
right
and
left
how
his
saber
had
tasted
flesh
and
he
had
fallen
exhausted
and
so
on
and
so
he
told
them
all
that
in
the
middle
of
his
story
just
as
he
was
saying
you
cannot
imagine
what
a
strange
frenzy
one
experiences
during
an
attack
prince
andrew
whom
boris
was
expecting
entered
the
room
prince
andrew
who
liked
to
help
young
men
was
flattered
by
being
asked
for
his
assistance
and
being
well
disposed
toward
boris
who
had
managed
to
please
him
the
day
before
he
wished
to
do
what
the
young
man
wanted
having
been
sent
with
papers
from
kutuzov
to
the
tsarevich
he
looked
in
on
boris
hoping
to
find
him
alone
when
he
came
in
and
saw
an
hussar
of
the
line
recounting
his
military
exploits
prince
andrew
could
not
endure
that
sort
of
man
he
gave
boris
a
pleasant
smile
frowned
as
with
half
closed
eyes
he
looked
at
rostov
bowed
slightly
and
wearily
and
sat
down
languidly
on
the
sofa
he
felt
it
unpleasant
to
have
dropped
in
on
bad
company
rostov
flushed
up
on
noticing
this
but
he
did
not
care
this
was
a
mere
stranger
glancing
however
at
boris
he
saw
that
he
too
seemed
ashamed
of
the
hussar
of
the
line
in
spite
of
prince
andrew
s
disagreeable
ironical
tone
in
spite
of
the
contempt
with
which
rostov
from
his
fighting
army
point
of
view
regarded
all
these
little
adjutants
on
the
staff
of
whom
the
newcomer
was
evidently
one
rostov
felt
confused
blushed
and
became
silent
boris
inquired
what
news
there
might
be
on
the
staff
and
what
without
indiscretion
one
might
ask
about
our
plans
we
shall
probably
advance
replied
bolkonski
evidently
reluctant
to
say
more
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
berg
took
the
opportunity
to
ask
with
great
politeness
whether
as
was
rumored
the
allowance
of
forage
money
to
captains
of
companies
would
be
doubled
to
this
prince
andrew
answered
with
a
smile
that
he
could
give
no
opinion
on
such
an
important
government
order
and
berg
laughed
gaily
as
to
your
business
prince
andrew
continued
addressing
boris
we
will
talk
of
it
later
and
he
looked
round
at
rostov
come
to
me
after
the
review
and
we
will
do
what
is
possible
and
having
glanced
round
the
room
prince
andrew
turned
to
rostov
whose
state
of
unconquerable
childish
embarrassment
now
changing
to
anger
he
did
not
condescend
to
notice
and
said
i
think
you
were
talking
of
the
schon
grabern
affair
were
you
there
i
was
there
said
rostov
angrily
as
if
intending
to
insult
the
aide
de
camp
bolkonski
noticed
the
hussar
s
state
of
mind
and
it
amused
him
with
a
slightly
contemptuous
smile
he
said
yes
there
are
many
stories
now
told
about
that
affair
yes
stories
repeated
rostov
loudly
looking
with
eyes
suddenly
grown
furious
now
at
boris
now
at
bolkonski
yes
many
stories
but
our
stories
are
the
stories
of
men
who
have
been
under
the
enemy
s
fire
our
stories
have
some
weight
not
like
the
stories
of
those
fellows
on
the
staff
who
get
rewards
without
doing
anything
of
whom
you
imagine
me
to
be
one
said
prince
andrew
with
a
quiet
and
particularly
amiable
smile
a
strange
feeling
of
exasperation
and
yet
of
respect
for
this
man
s
self
possession
mingled
at
that
moment
in
rostov
s
soul
i
am
not
talking
about
you
he
said
i
don
t
know
you
and
frankly
i
don
t
want
to
i
am
speaking
of
the
staff
in
general
and
i
will
tell
you
this
prince
andrew
interrupted
in
a
tone
of
quiet
authority
you
wish
to
insult
me
and
i
am
ready
to
agree
with
you
that
it
would
be
very
easy
to
do
so
if
you
haven
t
sufficient
self
respect
but
admit
that
the
time
and
place
are
very
badly
chosen
in
a
day
or
two
we
shall
all
have
to
take
part
in
a
greater
and
more
serious
duel
and
besides
drubetskoy
who
says
he
is
an
old
friend
of
yours
is
not
at
all
to
blame
that
my
face
has
the
misfortune
to
displease
you
however
he
added
rising
you
know
my
name
and
where
to
find
me
but
don
t
forget
that
i
do
not
regard
either
myself
or
you
as
having
been
at
all
insulted
and
as
a
man
older
than
you
my
advice
is
to
let
the
matter
drop
well
then
on
friday
after
the
review
i
shall
expect
you
drubetskoy
au
revoir
exclaimed
prince
andrew
and
with
a
bow
to
them
both
he
went
out
only
when
prince
andrew
was
gone
did
rostov
think
of
what
he
ought
to
have
said
and
he
was
still
more
angry
at
having
omitted
to
say
it
he
ordered
his
horse
at
once
and
coldly
taking
leave
of
boris
rode
home
should
he
go
to
headquarters
next
day
and
challenge
that
affected
adjutant
or
really
let
the
matter
drop
was
the
question
that
worried
him
all
the
way
he
thought
angrily
of
the
pleasure
he
would
have
at
seeing
the
fright
of
that
small
and
frail
but
proud
man
when
covered
by
his
pistol
and
then
he
felt
with
surprise
that
of
all
the
men
he
knew
there
was
none
he
would
so
much
like
to
have
for
a
friend
as
that
very
adjutant
whom
he
so
hated
chapter
viii
the
day
after
rostov
had
been
to
see
boris
a
review
was
held
of
the
austrian
and
russian
troops
both
those
freshly
arrived
from
russia
and
those
who
had
been
campaigning
under
kutuzov
the
two
emperors
the
russian
with
his
heir
the
tsarevich
and
the
austrian
with
the
archduke
inspected
the
allied
army
of
eighty
thousand
men
from
early
morning
the
smart
clean
troops
were
on
the
move
forming
up
on
the
field
before
the
fortress
now
thousands
of
feet
and
bayonets
moved
and
halted
at
the
officers
command
turned
with
banners
flying
formed
up
at
intervals
and
wheeled
round
other
similar
masses
of
infantry
in
different
uniforms
now
was
heard
the
rhythmic
beat
of
hoofs
and
the
jingling
of
showy
cavalry
in
blue
red
and
green
braided
uniforms
with
smartly
dressed
bandsmen
in
front
mounted
on
black
roan
or
gray
horses
then
again
spreading
out
with
the
brazen
clatter
of
the
polished
shining
cannon
that
quivered
on
the
gun
carriages
and
with
the
smell
of
linstocks
came
the
artillery
which
crawled
between
the
infantry
and
cavalry
and
took
up
its
appointed
position
not
only
the
generals
in
full
parade
uniforms
with
their
thin
or
thick
waists
drawn
in
to
the
utmost
their
red
necks
squeezed
into
their
stiff
collars
and
wearing
scarves
and
all
their
decorations
not
only
the
elegant
pomaded
officers
but
every
soldier
with
his
freshly
washed
and
shaven
face
and
his
weapons
clean
and
polished
to
the
utmost
and
every
horse
groomed
till
its
coat
shone
like
satin
and
every
hair
of
its
wetted
mane
lay
smooth
felt
that
no
small
matter
was
happening
but
an
important
and
solemn
affair
every
general
and
every
soldier
was
conscious
of
his
own
insignificance
aware
of
being
but
a
drop
in
that
ocean
of
men
and
yet
at
the
same
time
was
conscious
of
his
strength
as
a
part
of
that
enormous
whole
from
early
morning
strenuous
activities
and
efforts
had
begun
and
by
ten
o
clock
all
had
been
brought
into
due
order
the
ranks
were
drawn
up
on
the
vast
field
the
whole
army
was
extended
in
three
lines
the
cavalry
in
front
behind
it
the
artillery
and
behind
that
again
the
infantry
a
space
like
a
street
was
left
between
each
two
lines
of
troops
the
three
parts
of
that
army
were
sharply
distinguished
kutuzov
s
fighting
army
with
the
pavlograds
on
the
right
flank
of
the
front
those
recently
arrived
from
russia
both
guards
and
regiments
of
the
line
and
the
austrian
troops
but
they
all
stood
in
the
same
lines
under
one
command
and
in
a
like
order
like
wind
over
leaves
ran
an
excited
whisper
they
re
coming
they
re
coming
alarmed
voices
were
heard
and
a
stir
of
final
preparation
swept
over
all
the
troops
from
the
direction
of
olmutz
in
front
of
them
a
group
was
seen
approaching
and
at
that
moment
though
the
day
was
still
a
light
gust
of
wind
blowing
over
the
army
slightly
stirred
the
streamers
on
the
lances
and
the
unfolded
standards
fluttered
against
their
staffs
it
looked
as
if
by
that
slight
motion
the
army
itself
was
expressing
its
joy
at
the
approach
of
the
emperors
one
voice
was
heard
shouting
eyes
front
then
like
the
crowing
of
cocks
at
sunrise
this
was
repeated
by
others
from
various
sides
and
all
became
silent
in
the
deathlike
stillness
only
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard
this
was
the
emperors
suites
the
emperors
rode
up
to
the
flank
and
the
trumpets
of
the
first
cavalry
regiment
played
the
general
march
it
seemed
as
though
not
the
trumpeters
were
playing
but
as
if
the
army
itself
rejoicing
at
the
emperors
approach
had
naturally
burst
into
music
amid
these
sounds
only
the
youthful
kindly
voice
of
the
emperor
alexander
was
clearly
heard
he
gave
the
words
of
greeting
and
the
first
regiment
roared
hurrah
so
deafeningly
continuously
and
joyfully
that
the
men
themselves
were
awed
by
their
multitude
and
the
immensity
of
the
power
they
constituted
rostov
standing
in
the
front
lines
of
kutuzov
s
army
which
the
tsar
approached
first
experienced
the
same
feeling
as
every
other
man
in
that
army
a
feeling
of
self
forgetfulness
a
proud
consciousness
of
might
and
a
passionate
attraction
to
him
who
was
the
cause
of
this
triumph
he
felt
that
at
a
single
word
from
that
man
all
this
vast
mass
and
he
himself
an
insignificant
atom
in
it
would
go
through
fire
and
water
commit
crime
die
or
perform
deeds
of
highest
heroism
and
so
he
could
not
but
tremble
and
his
heart
stand
still
at
the
imminence
of
that
word
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
thundered
from
all
sides
one
regiment
after
another
greeting
the
tsar
with
the
strains
of
the
march
and
then
hurrah
then
the
general
march
and
again
hurrah
hurrah
growing
ever
stronger
and
fuller
and
merging
into
a
deafening
roar
till
the
tsar
reached
it
each
regiment
in
its
silence
and
immobility
seemed
like
a
lifeless
body
but
as
soon
as
he
came
up
it
became
alive
its
thunder
joining
the
roar
of
the
whole
line
along
which
he
had
already
passed
through
the
terrible
and
deafening
roar
of
those
voices
amid
the
square
masses
of
troops
standing
motionless
as
if
turned
to
stone
hundreds
of
riders
composing
the
suites
moved
carelessly
but
symmetrically
and
above
all
freely
and
in
front
of
them
two
men
the
emperors
upon
them
the
undivided
tensely
passionate
attention
of
that
whole
mass
of
men
was
concentrated
the
handsome
young
emperor
alexander
in
the
uniform
of
the
horse
guards
wearing
a
cocked
hat
with
its
peaks
front
and
back
with
his
pleasant
face
and
resonant
though
not
loud
voice
attracted
everyone
s
attention
rostov
was
not
far
from
the
trumpeters
and
with
his
keen
sight
had
recognized
the
tsar
and
watched
his
approach
when
he
was
within
twenty
paces
and
nicholas
could
clearly
distinguish
every
detail
of
his
handsome
happy
young
face
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
tenderness
and
ecstasy
such
as
he
had
never
before
known
every
trait
and
every
movement
of
the
tsar
s
seemed
to
him
enchanting
stopping
in
front
of
the
pavlograds
the
tsar
said
something
in
french
to
the
austrian
emperor
and
smiled
seeing
that
smile
rostov
involuntarily
smiled
himself
and
felt
a
still
stronger
flow
of
love
for
his
sovereign
he
longed
to
show
that
love
in
some
way
and
knowing
that
this
was
impossible
was
ready
to
cry
the
tsar
called
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
and
said
a
few
words
to
him
oh
god
what
would
happen
to
me
if
the
emperor
spoke
to
me
thought
rostov
i
should
die
of
happiness
the
tsar
addressed
the
officers
also
i
thank
you
all
gentlemen
i
thank
you
with
my
whole
heart
to
rostov
every
word
sounded
like
a
voice
from
heaven
how
gladly
would
he
have
died
at
once
for
his
tsar
you
have
earned
the
st
george
s
standards
and
will
be
worthy
of
them
oh
to
die
to
die
for
him
thought
rostov
the
tsar
said
something
more
which
rostov
did
not
hear
and
the
soldiers
straining
their
lungs
shouted
hurrah
rostov
too
bending
over
his
saddle
shouted
hurrah
with
all
his
might
feeling
that
he
would
like
to
injure
himself
by
that
shout
if
only
to
express
his
rapture
fully
the
tsar
stopped
a
few
minutes
in
front
of
the
hussars
as
if
undecided
how
can
the
emperor
be
undecided
thought
rostov
but
then
even
this
indecision
appeared
to
him
majestic
and
enchanting
like
everything
else
the
tsar
did
that
hesitation
lasted
only
an
instant
the
tsar
s
foot
in
the
narrow
pointed
boot
then
fashionable
touched
the
groin
of
the
bobtailed
bay
mare
he
rode
his
hand
in
a
white
glove
gathered
up
the
reins
and
he
moved
off
accompanied
by
an
irregularly
swaying
sea
of
aides
de
camp
farther
and
farther
he
rode
away
stopping
at
other
regiments
till
at
last
only
his
white
plumes
were
visible
to
rostov
from
amid
the
suites
that
surrounded
the
emperors
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite
rostov
noticed
bolkonski
sitting
his
horse
indolently
and
carelessly
rostov
recalled
their
quarrel
of
yesterday
and
the
question
presented
itself
whether
he
ought
or
ought
not
to
challenge
bolkonski
of
course
not
he
now
thought
is
it
worth
thinking
or
speaking
of
it
at
such
a
moment
at
a
time
of
such
love
such
rapture
and
such
self
sacrifice
what
do
any
of
our
quarrels
and
affronts
matter
i
love
and
forgive
everybody
now
when
the
emperor
had
passed
nearly
all
the
regiments
the
troops
began
a
ceremonial
march
past
him
and
rostov
on
bedouin
recently
purchased
from
denisov
rode
past
too
at
the
rear
of
his
squadron
that
is
alone
and
in
full
view
of
the
emperor
before
he
reached
him
rostov
who
was
a
splendid
horseman
spurred
bedouin
twice
and
successfully
put
him
to
the
showy
trot
in
which
the
animal
went
when
excited
bending
his
foaming
muzzle
to
his
chest
his
tail
extended
bedouin
as
if
also
conscious
of
the
emperor
s
eye
upon
him
passed
splendidly
lifting
his
feet
with
a
high
and
graceful
action
as
if
flying
through
the
air
without
touching
the
ground
rostov
himself
his
legs
well
back
and
his
stomach
drawn
in
and
feeling
himself
one
with
his
horse
rode
past
the
emperor
with
a
frowning
but
blissful
face
like
a
vewy
devil
as
denisov
expressed
it
fine
fellows
the
pavlograds
remarked
the
emperor
my
god
how
happy
i
should
be
if
he
ordered
me
to
leap
into
the
fire
this
instant
thought
rostov
when
the
review
was
over
the
newly
arrived
officers
and
also
kutuzov
s
collected
in
groups
and
began
to
talk
about
the
awards
about
the
austrians
and
their
uniforms
about
their
lines
about
bonaparte
and
how
badly
the
latter
would
fare
now
especially
if
the
essen
corps
arrived
and
prussia
took
our
side
but
the
talk
in
every
group
was
chiefly
about
the
emperor
alexander
his
every
word
and
movement
was
described
with
ecstasy
they
all
had
but
one
wish
to
advance
as
soon
as
possible
against
the
enemy
under
the
emperor
s
command
commanded
by
the
emperor
himself
they
could
not
fail
to
vanquish
anyone
be
it
whom
it
might
so
thought
rostov
and
most
of
the
officers
after
the
review
all
were
then
more
confident
of
victory
than
the
winning
of
two
battles
would
have
made
them
chapter
ix
the
day
after
the
review
boris
in
his
best
uniform
and
with
his
comrade
berg
s
best
wishes
for
success
rode
to
olmutz
to
see
bolkonski
wishing
to
profit
by
his
friendliness
and
obtain
for
himself
the
best
post
he
could
preferably
that
of
adjutant
to
some
important
personage
a
position
in
the
army
which
seemed
to
him
most
attractive
it
is
all
very
well
for
rostov
whose
father
sends
him
ten
thousand
rubles
at
a
time
to
talk
about
not
wishing
to
cringe
to
anybody
and
not
be
anyone
s
lackey
but
i
who
have
nothing
but
my
brains
have
to
make
a
career
and
must
not
miss
opportunities
but
must
avail
myself
of
them
he
reflected
he
did
not
find
prince
andrew
in
olmutz
that
day
but
the
appearance
of
the
town
where
the
headquarters
and
the
diplomatic
corps
were
stationed
and
the
two
emperors
were
living
with
their
suites
households
and
courts
only
strengthened
his
desire
to
belong
to
that
higher
world
he
knew
no
one
and
despite
his
smart
guardsman
s
uniform
all
these
exalted
personages
passing
in
the
streets
in
their
elegant
carriages
with
their
plumes
ribbons
and
medals
both
courtiers
and
military
men
seemed
so
immeasurably
above
him
an
insignificant
officer
of
the
guards
that
they
not
only
did
not
wish
to
but
simply
could
not
be
aware
of
his
existence
at
the
quarters
of
the
commander
in
chief
kutuzov
where
he
inquired
for
bolkonski
all
the
adjutants
and
even
the
orderlies
looked
at
him
as
if
they
wished
to
impress
on
him
that
a
great
many
officers
like
him
were
always
coming
there
and
that
everybody
was
heartily
sick
of
them
in
spite
of
this
or
rather
because
of
it
next
day
november
after
dinner
he
again
went
to
olmutz
and
entering
the
house
occupied
by
kutuzov
asked
for
bolkonski
prince
andrew
was
in
and
boris
was
shown
into
a
large
hall
probably
formerly
used
for
dancing
but
in
which
five
beds
now
stood
and
furniture
of
various
kinds
a
table
chairs
and
a
clavichord
one
adjutant
nearest
the
door
was
sitting
at
the
table
in
a
persian
dressing
gown
writing
another
the
red
stout
nesvitski
lay
on
a
bed
with
his
arms
under
his
head
laughing
with
an
officer
who
had
sat
down
beside
him
a
third
was
playing
a
viennese
waltz
on
the
clavichord
while
a
fourth
lying
on
the
clavichord
sang
the
tune
bolkonski
was
not
there
none
of
these
gentlemen
changed
his
position
on
seeing
boris
the
one
who
was
writing
and
whom
boris
addressed
turned
round
crossly
and
told
him
bolkonski
was
on
duty
and
that
he
should
go
through
the
door
on
the
left
into
the
reception
room
if
he
wished
to
see
him
boris
thanked
him
and
went
to
the
reception
room
where
he
found
some
ten
officers
and
generals
when
he
entered
prince
andrew
his
eyes
drooping
contemptuously
with
that
peculiar
expression
of
polite
weariness
which
plainly
says
if
it
were
not
my
duty
i
would
not
talk
to
you
for
a
moment
was
listening
to
an
old
russian
general
with
decorations
who
stood
very
erect
almost
on
tiptoe
with
a
soldier
s
obsequious
expression
on
his
purple
face
reporting
something
very
well
then
be
so
good
as
to
wait
said
prince
andrew
to
the
general
in
russian
speaking
with
the
french
intonation
he
affected
when
he
wished
to
speak
contemptuously
and
noticing
boris
prince
andrew
paying
no
more
heed
to
the
general
who
ran
after
him
imploring
him
to
hear
something
more
nodded
and
turned
to
him
with
a
cheerful
smile
at
that
moment
boris
clearly
realized
what
he
had
before
surmised
that
in
the
army
besides
the
subordination
and
discipline
prescribed
in
the
military
code
which
he
and
the
others
knew
in
the
regiment
there
was
another
more
important
subordination
which
made
this
tight
laced
purple
faced
general
wait
respectfully
while
captain
prince
andrew
for
his
own
pleasure
chose
to
chat
with
lieutenant
drubetskoy
more
than
ever
was
boris
resolved
to
serve
in
future
not
according
to
the
written
code
but
under
this
unwritten
law
he
felt
now
that
merely
by
having
been
recommended
to
prince
andrew
he
had
already
risen
above
the
general
who
at
the
front
had
the
power
to
annihilate
him
a
lieutenant
of
the
guards
prince
andrew
came
up
to
him
and
took
his
hand
i
am
very
sorry
you
did
not
find
me
in
yesterday
i
was
fussing
about
with
germans
all
day
we
went
with
weyrother
to
survey
the
dispositions
when
germans
start
being
accurate
there
s
no
end
to
it
boris
smiled
as
if
he
understood
what
prince
andrew
was
alluding
to
as
something
generally
known
but
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
weyrother
s
name
or
even
the
term
dispositions
well
my
dear
fellow
so
you
still
want
to
be
an
adjutant
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
yes
i
was
thinking
for
some
reason
boris
could
not
help
blushing
of
asking
the
commander
in
chief
he
has
had
a
letter
from
prince
kuragin
about
me
i
only
wanted
to
ask
because
i
fear
the
guards
won
t
be
in
action
he
added
as
if
in
apology
all
right
all
right
we
ll
talk
it
over
replied
prince
andrew
only
let
me
report
this
gentleman
s
business
and
i
shall
be
at
your
disposal
while
prince
andrew
went
to
report
about
the
purple
faced
general
that
gentleman
evidently
not
sharing
boris
conception
of
the
advantages
of
the
unwritten
code
of
subordination
looked
so
fixedly
at
the
presumptuous
lieutenant
who
had
prevented
his
finishing
what
he
had
to
say
to
the
adjutant
that
boris
felt
uncomfortable
he
turned
away
and
waited
impatiently
for
prince
andrew
s
return
from
the
commander
in
chief
s
room
you
see
my
dear
fellow
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
said
prince
andrew
when
they
had
gone
into
the
large
room
where
the
clavichord
was
it
s
no
use
your
going
to
the
commander
in
chief
he
would
say
a
lot
of
pleasant
things
ask
you
to
dinner
that
would
not
be
bad
as
regards
the
unwritten
code
thought
boris
but
nothing
more
would
come
of
it
there
will
soon
be
a
battalion
of
us
aides
de
camp
and
adjutants
but
this
is
what
we
ll
do
i
have
a
good
friend
an
adjutant
general
and
an
excellent
fellow
prince
dolgorukov
and
though
you
may
not
know
it
the
fact
is
that
now
kutuzov
with
his
staff
and
all
of
us
count
for
nothing
everything
is
now
centered
round
the
emperor
so
we
will
go
to
dolgorukov
i
have
to
go
there
anyhow
and
i
have
already
spoken
to
him
about
you
we
shall
see
whether
he
cannot
attach
you
to
himself
or
find
a
place
for
you
somewhere
nearer
the
sun
prince
andrew
always
became
specially
keen
when
he
had
to
guide
a
young
man
and
help
him
to
worldly
success
under
cover
of
obtaining
help
of
this
kind
for
another
which
from
pride
he
would
never
accept
for
himself
he
kept
in
touch
with
the
circle
which
confers
success
and
which
attracted
him
he
very
readily
took
up
boris
cause
and
went
with
him
to
dolgorukov
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
they
entered
the
palace
at
olmutz
occupied
by
the
emperors
and
their
retinues
that
same
day
a
council
of
war
had
been
held
in
which
all
the
members
of
the
hofkriegsrath
and
both
emperors
took
part
at
that
council
contrary
to
the
views
of
the
old
generals
kutuzov
and
prince
schwartzenberg
it
had
been
decided
to
advance
immediately
and
give
battle
to
bonaparte
the
council
of
war
was
just
over
when
prince
andrew
accompanied
by
boris
arrived
at
the
palace
to
find
dolgorukov
everyone
at
headquarters
was
still
under
the
spell
of
the
day
s
council
at
which
the
party
of
the
young
had
triumphed
the
voices
of
those
who
counseled
delay
and
advised
waiting
for
something
else
before
advancing
had
been
so
completely
silenced
and
their
arguments
confuted
by
such
conclusive
evidence
of
the
advantages
of
attacking
that
what
had
been
discussed
at
the
council
the
coming
battle
and
the
victory
that
would
certainly
result
from
it
no
longer
seemed
to
be
in
the
future
but
in
the
past
all
the
advantages
were
on
our
side
our
enormous
forces
undoubtedly
superior
to
napoleon
s
were
concentrated
in
one
place
the
troops
inspired
by
the
emperors
presence
were
eager
for
action
the
strategic
position
where
the
operations
would
take
place
was
familiar
in
all
its
details
to
the
austrian
general
weyrother
a
lucky
accident
had
ordained
that
the
austrian
army
should
maneuver
the
previous
year
on
the
very
fields
where
the
french
had
now
to
be
fought
the
adjacent
locality
was
known
and
shown
in
every
detail
on
the
maps
and
bonaparte
evidently
weakened
was
undertaking
nothing
dolgorukov
one
of
the
warmest
advocates
of
an
attack
had
just
returned
from
the
council
tired
and
exhausted
but
eager
and
proud
of
the
victory
that
had
been
gained
prince
andrew
introduced
his
protege
but
prince
dolgorukov
politely
and
firmly
pressing
his
hand
said
nothing
to
boris
and
evidently
unable
to
suppress
the
thoughts
which
were
uppermost
in
his
mind
at
that
moment
addressed
prince
andrew
in
french
ah
my
dear
fellow
what
a
battle
we
have
gained
god
grant
that
the
one
that
will
result
from
it
will
be
as
victorious
however
dear
fellow
he
said
abruptly
and
eagerly
i
must
confess
to
having
been
unjust
to
the
austrians
and
especially
to
weyrother
what
exactitude
what
minuteness
what
knowledge
of
the
locality
what
foresight
for
every
eventuality
every
possibility
even
to
the
smallest
detail
no
my
dear
fellow
no
conditions
better
than
our
present
ones
could
have
been
devised
this
combination
of
austrian
precision
with
russian
valor
what
more
could
be
wished
for
so
the
attack
is
definitely
resolved
on
asked
bolkonski
and
do
you
know
my
dear
fellow
it
seems
to
me
that
bonaparte
has
decidedly
lost
bearings
you
know
that
a
letter
was
received
from
him
today
for
the
emperor
dolgorukov
smiled
significantly
is
that
so
and
what
did
he
say
inquired
bolkonski
what
can
he
say
tra
di
ri
di
ra
and
so
on
merely
to
gain
time
i
tell
you
he
is
in
our
hands
that
s
certain
but
what
was
most
amusing
he
continued
with
a
sudden
good
natured
laugh
was
that
we
could
not
think
how
to
address
the
reply
if
not
as
consul
and
of
course
not
as
emperor
it
seemed
to
me
it
should
be
to
general
bonaparte
but
between
not
recognizing
him
as
emperor
and
calling
him
general
bonaparte
there
is
a
difference
remarked
bolkonski
that
s
just
it
interrupted
dolgorukov
quickly
laughing
you
know
bilibin
he
s
a
very
clever
fellow
he
suggested
addressing
him
as
usurper
and
enemy
of
mankind
dolgorukov
laughed
merrily
only
that
said
bolkonski
all
the
same
it
was
bilibin
who
found
a
suitable
form
for
the
address
he
is
a
wise
and
clever
fellow
what
was
it
to
the
head
of
the
french
government
au
chef
du
gouvernement
francais
said
dolgorukov
with
grave
satisfaction
good
wasn
t
it
yes
but
he
will
dislike
it
extremely
said
bolkonski
oh
yes
very
much
my
brother
knows
him
he
s
dined
with
him
the
present
emperor
more
than
once
in
paris
and
tells
me
he
never
met
a
more
cunning
or
subtle
diplomatist
you
know
a
combination
of
french
adroitness
and
italian
play
acting
do
you
know
the
tale
about
him
and
count
markov
count
markov
was
the
only
man
who
knew
how
to
handle
him
you
know
the
story
of
the
handkerchief
it
is
delightful
and
the
talkative
dolgorukov
turning
now
to
boris
now
to
prince
andrew
told
how
bonaparte
wishing
to
test
markov
our
ambassador
purposely
dropped
a
handkerchief
in
front
of
him
and
stood
looking
at
markov
probably
expecting
markov
to
pick
it
up
for
him
and
how
markov
immediately
dropped
his
own
beside
it
and
picked
it
up
without
touching
bonaparte
s
delightful
said
bolkonski
but
i
have
come
to
you
prince
as
a
petitioner
on
behalf
of
this
young
man
you
see
but
before
prince
andrew
could
finish
an
aide
de
camp
came
in
to
summon
dolgorukov
to
the
emperor
oh
what
a
nuisance
said
dolgorukov
getting
up
hurriedly
and
pressing
the
hands
of
prince
andrew
and
boris
you
know
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
all
in
my
power
both
for
you
and
for
this
dear
young
man
again
he
pressed
the
hand
of
the
latter
with
an
expression
of
good
natured
sincere
and
animated
levity
but
you
see
another
time
boris
was
excited
by
the
thought
of
being
so
close
to
the
higher
powers
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
at
that
moment
he
was
conscious
that
here
he
was
in
contact
with
the
springs
that
set
in
motion
the
enormous
movements
of
the
mass
of
which
in
his
regiment
he
felt
himself
a
tiny
obedient
and
insignificant
atom
they
followed
prince
dolgorukov
out
into
the
corridor
and
met
coming
out
of
the
door
of
the
emperor
s
room
by
which
dolgorukov
had
entered
a
short
man
in
civilian
clothes
with
a
clever
face
and
sharply
projecting
jaw
which
without
spoiling
his
face
gave
him
a
peculiar
vivacity
and
shiftiness
of
expression
this
short
man
nodded
to
dolgorukov
as
to
an
intimate
friend
and
stared
at
prince
andrew
with
cool
intensity
walking
straight
toward
him
and
evidently
expecting
him
to
bow
or
to
step
out
of
his
way
prince
andrew
did
neither
a
look
of
animosity
appeared
on
his
face
and
the
other
turned
away
and
went
down
the
side
of
the
corridor
who
was
that
asked
boris
he
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
but
to
me
most
unpleasant
of
men
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
prince
adam
czartoryski
it
is
such
men
as
he
who
decide
the
fate
of
nations
added
bolkonski
with
a
sigh
he
could
not
suppress
as
they
passed
out
of
the
palace
next
day
the
army
began
its
campaign
and
up
to
the
very
battle
of
austerlitz
boris
was
unable
to
see
either
prince
andrew
or
dolgorukov
again
and
remained
for
a
while
with
the
ismaylov
regiment
chapter
x
at
dawn
on
the
sixteenth
of
november
denisov
s
squadron
in
which
nicholas
rostov
served
and
which
was
in
prince
bagration
s
detachment
moved
from
the
place
where
it
had
spent
the
night
advancing
into
action
as
arranged
and
after
going
behind
other
columns
for
about
two
thirds
of
a
mile
was
stopped
on
the
highroad
rostov
saw
the
cossacks
and
then
the
first
and
second
squadrons
of
hussars
and
infantry
battalions
and
artillery
pass
by
and
go
forward
and
then
generals
bagration
and
dolgorukov
ride
past
with
their
adjutants
all
the
fear
before
action
which
he
had
experienced
as
previously
all
the
inner
struggle
to
conquer
that
fear
all
his
dreams
of
distinguishing
himself
as
a
true
hussar
in
this
battle
had
been
wasted
their
squadron
remained
in
reserve
and
nicholas
rostov
spent
that
day
in
a
dull
and
wretched
mood
at
nine
in
the
morning
he
heard
firing
in
front
and
shouts
of
hurrah
and
saw
wounded
being
brought
back
there
were
not
many
of
them
and
at
last
he
saw
how
a
whole
detachment
of
french
cavalry
was
brought
in
convoyed
by
a
sotnya
of
cossacks
evidently
the
affair
was
over
and
though
not
big
had
been
a
successful
engagement
the
men
and
officers
returning
spoke
of
a
brilliant
victory
of
the
occupation
of
the
town
of
wischau
and
the
capture
of
a
whole
french
squadron
the
day
was
bright
and
sunny
after
a
sharp
night
frost
and
the
cheerful
glitter
of
that
autumn
day
was
in
keeping
with
the
news
of
victory
which
was
conveyed
not
only
by
the
tales
of
those
who
had
taken
part
in
it
but
also
by
the
joyful
expression
on
the
faces
of
soldiers
officers
generals
and
adjutants
as
they
passed
rostov
going
or
coming
and
nicholas
who
had
vainly
suffered
all
the
dread
that
precedes
a
battle
and
had
spent
that
happy
day
in
inactivity
was
all
the
more
depressed
come
here
wostov
let
s
dwink
to

our
gwief
shouted
denisov
who
had
settled
down
by
the
roadside
with
a
flask
and
some
food
the
officers
gathered
round
denisov
s
canteen
eating
and
talking
there
they

cried
one
of
the
officers
indicating
a
captive
french
dragoon
who
was
being
brought
in
on
foot
by
two
cossacks
one
of
them
was
leading
by

a
fine

french
horse

had
taken
from

denisov
called

like
your
honor
the
officers
got
up
and
stood
round
the
cossacks
and
their
prisoner
the
french
dragoon
was
a
young
alsatian
who
spoke
french
with
a
german
accent
he
was
breathless
with
agitation
his
face
was
red
and
when
he
heard
some
french
spoken
he
at
once
began
speaking
to
the
officers
addressing
first
one
then
another
he
said
he
would
not
have
been
taken
it
was
not
his
fault
but
the
corporal
s
who
had
sent
him
to
seize
some
horsecloths
though
he
had
told
him
the
russians
were
there
and
at
every
word
he
added
but
don
t
hurt
my
little
horse
and
stroked
the
animal
it
was
plain
that
he
did
not
quite
grasp
where
he
was
now
he
excused
himself
for
having
been
taken
prisoner
and
now
imagining
himself
before
his
own
officers
insisted
on
his
soldierly
discipline
and
zeal
in
the
service
he
brought
with
him
into
our
rearguard
all
the
freshness
of
atmosphere
of
the
french
army
which
was
so
alien
to
us
the
cossacks
sold
the
horse
for
two
gold
pieces
and
rostov
being
the
richest
of
the
officers
now
that
he
had
received
his
money
bought
it
but
don
t
hurt
my
little
horse
said
the
alsatian
good
naturedly
to
rostov
when
the
animal
was
handed
over
to
the
hussar
rostov
smilingly
reassured
the
dragoon
and
gave
him
money
alley
alley
said
the
cossack
touching
the
prisoner
s
arm
to
make
him
go
on
the
emperor
the
emperor
was
suddenly
heard
among
the
hussars
all
began
to
run
and
bustle
and
rostov
saw
coming
up
the
road
behind
him
several
riders
with
white
plumes
in
their
hats
in
a
moment
everyone
was
in
his
place
waiting
rostov
did
not
know
or
remember
how
he
ran
to
his
place
and
mounted
instantly
his
regret
at
not
having
been
in
action
and
his
dejected
mood
amid
people
of
whom
he
was
weary
had
gone
instantly
every
thought
of
himself
had
vanished
he
was
filled
with
happiness
at
his
nearness
to
the
emperor
he
felt
that
this
nearness
by
itself
made
up
to
him
for
the
day
he
had
lost
he
was
happy
as
a
lover
when
the
longed
for
moment
of
meeting
arrives
not
daring
to
look
round
and
without
looking
round
he
was
ecstatically
conscious
of
his
approach
he
felt
it
not
only
from
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
of
the
approaching
cavalcade
but
because
as
he
drew
near
everything
grew
brighter
more
joyful
more
significant
and
more
festive
around
him
nearer
and
nearer
to
rostov
came
that
sun
shedding
beams
of
mild
and
majestic
light
around
and
already
he
felt
himself
enveloped
in
those
beams
he
heard
his
voice
that
kindly
calm
and
majestic
voice
that
was
yet
so
simple
and
as
if
in
accord
with
rostov
s
feeling
there
was
a
deathly
stillness
amid
which
was
heard
the
emperor
s
voice
the
pavlograd
hussars
he
inquired
the
reserves
sire
replied
a
voice
a
very
human
one
compared
to
that
which
had
said
the
pavlograd
hussars
the
emperor
drew
level
with
rostov
and
halted
alexander
s
face
was
even
more
beautiful
than
it
had
been
three
days
before
at
the
review
it
shone
with
such
gaiety
and
youth
such
innocent
youth
that
it
suggested
the
liveliness
of
a
fourteen
year
old
boy
and
yet
it
was
the
face
of
the
majestic
emperor
casually
while
surveying
the
squadron
the
emperor
s
eyes
met
rostov
s
and
rested
on
them
for
not
more
than
two
seconds
whether
or
no
the
emperor
understood
what
was
going
on
in
rostov
s
soul
it
seemed
to
rostov
that
he
understood
everything
at
any
rate
his
light
blue
eyes
gazed
for
about
two
seconds
into
rostov
s
face
a
gentle
mild
light
poured
from
them
then
all
at
once
he
raised
his
eyebrows
abruptly
touched
his
horse
with
his
left
foot
and
galloped
on
the
younger
emperor
could
not
restrain
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
battle
and
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
his
courtiers
at
twelve
o
clock
left
the
third
column
with
which
he
had
been
and
galloped
toward
the
vanguard
before
he
came
up
with
the
hussars
several
adjutants
met
him
with
news
of
the
successful
result
of
the
action
this
battle
which
consisted
in
the
capture
of
a
french
squadron
was
represented
as
a
brilliant
victory
over
the
french
and
so
the
emperor
and
the
whole
army
especially
while
the
smoke
hung
over
the
battlefield
believed
that
the
french
had
been
defeated
and
were
retreating
against
their
will
a
few
minutes
after
the
emperor
had
passed
the
pavlograd
division
was
ordered
to
advance
in
wischau
itself
a
petty
german
town
rostov
saw
the
emperor
again
in
the
market
place
where
there
had
been
some
rather
heavy
firing
before
the
emperor
s
arrival
lay
several
killed
and
wounded
soldiers
whom
there
had
not
been
time
to
move
the
emperor
surrounded
by
his
suite
of
officers
and
courtiers
was
riding
a
bobtailed
chestnut
mare
a
different
one
from
that
which
he
had
ridden
at
the
review
and
bending
to
one
side
he
gracefully
held
a
gold
lorgnette
to
his
eyes
and
looked
at
a
soldier
who
lay
prone
with
blood
on
his
uncovered
head
the
wounded
soldier
was
so
dirty
coarse
and
revolting
that
his
proximity
to
the
emperor
shocked
rostov
rostov
saw
how
the
emperor
s
rather
round
shoulders
shuddered
as
if
a
cold
shiver
had
run
down
them
how
his
left
foot
began
convulsively
tapping
the
horse
s
side
with
the
spur
and
how
the
well
trained
horse
looked
round
unconcerned
and
did
not
stir
an
adjutant
dismounting
lifted
the
soldier
under
the
arms
to
place
him
on
a
stretcher
that
had
been
brought
the
soldier
groaned
gently
gently
can
t
you
do
it
more
gently
said
the
emperor
apparently
suffering
more
than
the
dying
soldier
and
he
rode
away
rostov
saw
tears
filling
the
emperor
s
eyes
and
heard
him
as
he
was
riding
away
say
to
czartoryski
what
a
terrible
thing
war
is
what
a
terrible
thing
quelle
terrible
chose
que
la
guerre
the
troops
of
the
vanguard
were
stationed
before
wischau
within
sight
of
the
enemy
s
lines
which
all
day
long
had
yielded
ground
to
us
at
the
least
firing
the
emperor
s
gratitude
was
announced
to
the
vanguard
rewards
were
promised
and
the
men
received
a
double
ration
of
vodka
the
campfires
crackled
and
the
soldiers
songs
resounded
even
more
merrily
than
on
the
previous
night
denisov
celebrated
his
promotion
to
the
rank
of
major
and
rostov
who
had
already
drunk
enough
at
the
end
of
the
feast
proposed
the
emperor
s
health
not
our
sovereign
the
emperor
as
they
say
at
official
dinners
said
he
but
the
health
of
our
sovereign
that
good
enchanting
and
great
man
let
us
drink
to
his
health
and
to
the
certain
defeat
of
the
french
if
we
fought
before
he
said
not
letting
the
french
pass
as
at
schon
grabern
what
shall
we
not
do
now
when
he
is
at
the
front
we
will
all
die
for
him
gladly
is
it
not
so
gentlemen
perhaps
i
am
not
saying
it
right
i
have
drunk
a
good
deal
but
that
is
how
i
feel
and
so
do
you
too
to
the
health
of
alexander
the
first
hurrah
hurrah
rang
the
enthusiastic
voices
of
the
officers
and
the
old
cavalry
captain
kirsten
shouted
enthusiastically
and
no
less
sincerely
than
the
twenty
year
old
rostov
when
the
officers
had
emptied
and
smashed
their
glasses
kirsten
filled
others
and
in
shirt
sleeves
and
breeches
went
glass
in
hand
to
the
soldiers
bonfires
and
with
his
long
gray
mustache
his
white
chest
showing
under
his
open
shirt
he
stood
in
a
majestic
pose
in
the
light
of
the
campfire
waving
his
uplifted
arm
lads
here
s
to
our
sovereign
the
emperor
and
victory
over
our
enemies
hurrah
he
exclaimed
in
his
dashing
old
hussar
s
baritone
the
hussars
crowded
round
and
responded
heartily
with
loud
shouts
late
that
night
when
all
had
separated
denisov
with
his
short
hand
patted
his
favorite
rostov
on
the
shoulder
as
there
s
no
one
to
fall
in
love
with
on
campaign
he
s
fallen
in
love
with
the
tsar
he
said
denisov
don
t
make
fun
of
it
cried
rostov
it
is
such
a
lofty
beautiful
feeling
such
a
i
believe
it
i
believe
it
fwiend
and
i
share
and
appwove
no
you
don
t
understand
and
rostov
got
up
and
went
wandering
among
the
campfires
dreaming
of
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
die
not
in
saving
the
emperor
s
life
he
did
not
even
dare
to
dream
of
that
but
simply
to
die
before
his
eyes
he
really
was
in
love
with
the
tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
russian
arms
and
the
hope
of
future
triumph
and
he
was
not
the
only
man
to
experience
that
feeling
during
those
memorable
days
preceding
the
battle
of
austerlitz
nine
tenths
of
the
men
in
the
russian
army
were
then
in
love
though
less
ecstatically
with
their
tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
russian
arms
chapter
xi
the
next
day
the
emperor
stopped
at
wischau
and
villier
his
physician
was
repeatedly
summoned
to
see
him
at
headquarters
and
among
the
troops
near
by
the
news
spread
that
the
emperor
was
unwell
he
ate
nothing
and
had
slept
badly
that
night
those
around
him
reported
the
cause
of
this
indisposition
was
the
strong
impression
made
on
his
sensitive
mind
by
the
sight
of
the
killed
and
wounded
at
daybreak
on
the
seventeenth
a
french
officer
who
had
come
with
a
flag
of
truce
demanding
an
audience
with
the
russian
emperor
was
brought
into
wischau
from
our
outposts
this
officer
was
savary
the
emperor
had
only
just
fallen
asleep
and
so
savary
had
to
wait
at
midday
he
was
admitted
to
the
emperor
and
an
hour
later
he
rode
off
with
prince
dolgorukov
to
the
advanced
post
of
the
french
army
it
was
rumored
that
savary
had
been
sent
to
propose
to
alexander
a
meeting
with
napoleon
to
the
joy
and
pride
of
the
whole
army
a
personal
interview
was
refused
and
instead
of
the
sovereign
prince
dolgorukov
the
victor
at
wischau
was
sent
with
savary
to
negotiate
with
napoleon
if
contrary
to
expectations
these
negotiations
were
actuated
by
a
real
desire
for
peace
toward
evening
dolgorukov
came
back
went
straight
to
the
tsar
and
remained
alone
with
him
for
a
long
time
on
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
of
november
the
army
advanced
two
days
march
and
the
enemy
s
outposts
after
a
brief
interchange
of
shots
retreated
in
the
highest
army
circles
from
midday
on
the
nineteenth
a
great
excitedly
bustling
activity
began
which
lasted
till
the
morning
of
the
twentieth
when
the
memorable
battle
of
austerlitz
was
fought
till
midday
on
the
nineteenth
the
activity
the
eager
talk
running
to
and
fro
and
dispatching
of
adjutants
was
confined
to
the
emperor
s
headquarters
but
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
this
activity
reached
kutuzov
s
headquarters
and
the
staffs
of
the
commanders
of
columns
by
evening
the
adjutants
had
spread
it
to
all
ends
and
parts
of
the
army
and
in
the
night
from
the
nineteenth
to
the
twentieth
the
whole
eighty
thousand
allied
troops
rose
from
their
bivouacs
to
the
hum
of
voices
and
the
army
swayed
and
started
in
one
enormous
mass
six
miles
long
the
concentrated
activity
which
had
begun
at
the
emperor
s
headquarters
in
the
morning
and
had
started
the
whole
movement
that
followed
was
like
the
first
movement
of
the
main
wheel
of
a
large
tower
clock
one
wheel
slowly
moved
another
was
set
in
motion
and
a
third
and
wheels
began
to
revolve
faster
and
faster
levers
and
cogwheels
to
work
chimes
to
play
figures
to
pop
out
and
the
hands
to
advance
with
regular
motion
as
a
result
of
all
that
activity
just
as
in
the
mechanism
of
a
clock
so
in
the
mechanism
of
the
military
machine
an
impulse
once
given
leads
to
the
final
result
and
just
as
indifferently
quiescent
till
the
moment
when
motion
is
transmitted
to
them
are
the
parts
of
the
mechanism
which
the
impulse
has
not
yet
reached
wheels
creak
on
their
axles
as
the
cogs
engage
one
another
and
the
revolving
pulleys
whirr
with
the
rapidity
of
their
movement
but
a
neighboring
wheel
is
as
quiet
and
motionless
as
though
it
were
prepared
to
remain
so
for
a
hundred
years
but
the
moment
comes
when
the
lever
catches
it
and
obeying
the
impulse
that
wheel
begins
to
creak
and
joins
in
the
common
motion
the
result
and
aim
of
which
are
beyond
its
ken
just
as
in
a
clock
the
result
of
the
complicated
motion
of
innumerable
wheels
and
pulleys
is
merely
a
slow
and
regular
movement
of
the
hands
which
show
the
time
so
the
result
of
all
the
complicated
human
activities
of
russians
and
french
all
their
passions
desires
remorse
humiliations
sufferings
outbursts
of
pride
fear
and
enthusiasm
was
only
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
the
so
called
battle
of
the
three
emperors
that
is
to
say
a
slow
movement
of
the
hand
on
the
dial
of
human
history
prince
andrew
was
on
duty
that
day
and
in
constant
attendance
on
the
commander
in
chief
at
six
in
the
evening
kutuzov
went
to
the
emperor
s
headquarters
and
after
staying
but
a
short
time
with
the
tsar
went
to
see
the
grand
marshal
of
the
court
count
tolstoy
bolkonski
took
the
opportunity
to
go
in
to
get
some
details
of
the
coming
action
from
dolgorukov
he
felt
that
kutuzov
was
upset
and
dissatisfied
about
something
and
that
at
headquarters
they
were
dissatisfied
with
him
and
also
that
at
the
emperor
s
headquarters
everyone
adopted
toward
him
the
tone
of
men
who
know
something
others
do
not
know
he
therefore
wished
to
speak
to
dolgorukov
well
how
d
you
do
my
dear
fellow
said
dolgorukov
who
was
sitting
at
tea
with
bilibin
the
fete
is
for
tomorrow
how
is
your
old
fellow
out
of
sorts
i
won
t
say
he
is
out
of
sorts
but
i
fancy
he
would
like
to
be
heard
but
they
heard
him
at
the
council
of
war
and
will
hear
him
when
he
talks
sense
but
to
temporize
and
wait
for
something
now
when
bonaparte
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
general
battle
is
impossible
yes
you
have
seen
him
said
prince
andrew
well
what
is
bonaparte
like
how
did
he
impress
you
yes
i
saw
him
and
am
convinced
that
he
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
general
engagement
repeated
dolgorukov
evidently
prizing
this
general
conclusion
which
he
had
arrived
at
from
his
interview
with
napoleon
if
he
weren
t
afraid
of
a
battle
why
did
he
ask
for
that
interview
why
negotiate
and
above
all
why
retreat
when
to
retreat
is
so
contrary
to
his
method
of
conducting
war
believe
me
he
is
afraid
afraid
of
a
general
battle
his
hour
has
come
mark
my
words
but
tell
me
what
is
he
like
eh
said
prince
andrew
again
he
is
a
man
in
a
gray
overcoat
very
anxious
that
i
should
call
him
your
majesty
but
who
to
his
chagrin
got
no
title
from
me
that
s
the
sort
of
man
he
is
and
nothing
more
replied
dolgorukov
looking
round
at
bilibin
with
a
smile
despite
my
great
respect
for
old
kutuzov
he
continued
we
should
be
a
nice
set
of
fellows
if
we
were
to
wait
about
and
so
give
him
a
chance
to
escape
or
to
trick
us
now
that
we
certainly
have
him
in
our
hands
no
we
mustn
t
forget
suvorov
and
his
rule
not
to
put
yourself
in
a
position
to
be
attacked
but
yourself
to
attack
believe
me
in
war
the
energy
of
young
men
often
shows
the
way
better
than
all
the
experience
of
old
cunctators
but
in
what
position
are
we
going
to
attack
him
i
have
been
at
the
outposts
today
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
his
chief
forces
are
situated
said
prince
andrew
he
wished
to
explain
to
dolgorukov
a
plan
of
attack
he
had
himself
formed
oh
that
is
all
the
same
dolgorukov
said
quickly
and
getting
up
he
spread
a
map
on
the
table
all
eventualities
have
been
foreseen
if
he
is
standing
before
brunn
and
prince
dolgorukov
rapidly
but
indistinctly
explained
weyrother
s
plan
of
a
flanking
movement
prince
andrew
began
to
reply
and
to
state
his
own
plan
which
might
have
been
as
good
as
weyrother
s
but
for
the
disadvantage
that
weyrother
s
had
already
been
approved
as
soon
as
prince
andrew
began
to
demonstrate
the
defects
of
the
latter
and
the
merits
of
his
own
plan
prince
dolgorukov
ceased
to
listen
to
him
and
gazed
absent
mindedly
not
at
the
map
but
at
prince
andrew
s
face
there
will
be
a
council
of
war
at
kutuzov
s
tonight
though
you
can
say
all
this
there
remarked
dolgorukov
i
will
do
so
said
prince
andrew
moving
away
from
the
map
whatever
are
you
bothering
about
gentlemen
said
bilibin
who
till
then
had
listened
with
an
amused
smile
to
their
conversation
and
now
was
evidently
ready
with
a
joke
whether
tomorrow
brings
victory
or
defeat
the
glory
of
our
russian
arms
is
secure
except
your
kutuzov
there
is
not
a
single
russian
in
command
of
a
column
the
commanders
are
herr
general
wimpfen
le
comte
de
langeron
le
prince
de
lichtenstein
le
prince
de
hohenlohe
and
finally
prishprish
and
so
on
like
all
those
polish
names
be
quiet
backbiter
said
dolgorukov
it
is
not
true
there
are
now
two
russians
miloradovich
and
dokhturov
and
there
would
be
a
third
count
arakcheev
if
his
nerves
were
not
too
weak
however
i
think
general
kutuzov
has
come
out
said
prince
andrew
i
wish
you
good
luck
and
success
gentlemen
he
added
and
went
out
after
shaking
hands
with
dolgorukov
and
bilibin
on
the
way
home
prince
andrew
could
not
refrain
from
asking
kutuzov
who
was
sitting
silently
beside
him
what
he
thought
of
tomorrow
s
battle
kutuzov
looked
sternly
at
his
adjutant
and
after
a
pause
replied
i
think
the
battle
will
be
lost
and
so
i
told
count
tolstoy
and
asked
him
to
tell
the
emperor
what
do
you
think
he
replied
but
my
dear
general
i
am
engaged
with
rice
and
cutlets
look
after
military
matters
yourself
yes
that
was
the
answer
i
got
chapter
xii
shortly
after
nine
o
clock
that
evening
weyrother
drove
with
his
plans
to
kutuzov
s
quarters
where
the
council
of
war
was
to
be
held
all
the
commanders
of
columns
were
summoned
to
the
commander
in
chief
s
and
with
the
exception
of
prince
bagration
who
declined
to
come
were
all
there
at
the
appointed
time
weyrother
who
was
in
full
control
of
the
proposed
battle
by
his
eagerness
and
briskness
presented
a
marked
contrast
to
the
dissatisfied
and
drowsy
kutuzov
who
reluctantly
played
the
part
of
chairman
and
president
of
the
council
of
war
weyrother
evidently
felt
himself
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
movement
that
had
already
become
unrestrainable
he
was
like
a
horse
running
downhill
harnessed
to
a
heavy
cart
whether
he
was
pulling
it
or
being
pushed
by
it
he
did
not
know
but
rushed
along
at
headlong
speed
with
no
time
to
consider
what
this
movement
might
lead
to
weyrother
had
been
twice
that
evening
to
the
enemy
s
picket
line
to
reconnoiter
personally
and
twice
to
the
emperors
russian
and
austrian
to
report
and
explain
and
to
his
headquarters
where
he
had
dictated
the
dispositions
in
german
and
now
much
exhausted
he
arrived
at
kutuzov
s
he
was
evidently
so
busy
that
he
even
forgot
to
be
polite
to
the
commander
in
chief
he
interrupted
him
talked
rapidly
and
indistinctly
without
looking
at
the
man
he
was
addressing
and
did
not
reply
to
questions
put
to
him
he
was
bespattered
with
mud
and
had
a
pitiful
weary
and
distracted
air
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
haughty
and
self
confident
kutuzov
was
occupying
a
nobleman
s
castle
of
modest
dimensions
near
ostralitz
in
the
large
drawing
room
which
had
become
the
commander
in
chief
s
office
were
gathered
kutuzov
himself
weyrother
and
the
members
of
the
council
of
war
they
were
drinking
tea
and
only
awaited
prince
bagration
to
begin
the
council
at
last
bagration
s
orderly
came
with
the
news
that
the
prince
could
not
attend
prince
andrew
came
in
to
inform
the
commander
in
chief
of
this
and
availing
himself
of
permission
previously
given
him
by
kutuzov
to
be
present
at
the
council
he
remained
in
the
room
since
prince
bagration
is
not
coming
we
may
begin
said
weyrother
hurriedly
rising
from
his
seat
and
going
up
to
the
table
on
which
an
enormous
map
of
the
environs
of
brunn
was
spread
out
kutuzov
with
his
uniform
unbuttoned
so
that
his
fat
neck
bulged
over
his
collar
as
if
escaping
was
sitting
almost
asleep
in
a
low
chair
with
his
podgy
old
hands
resting
symmetrically
on
its
arms
at
the
sound
of
weyrother
s
voice
he
opened
his
one
eye
with
an
effort
yes
yes
if
you
please
it
is
already
late
said
he
and
nodding
his
head
he
let
it
droop
and
again
closed
his
eye
if
at
first
the
members
of
the
council
thought
that
kutuzov
was
pretending
to
sleep
the
sounds
his
nose
emitted
during
the
reading
that
followed
proved
that
the
commander
in
chief
at
that
moment
was
absorbed
by
a
far
more
serious
matter
than
a
desire
to
show
his
contempt
for
the
dispositions
or
anything
else
he
was
engaged
in
satisfying
the
irresistible
human
need
for
sleep
he
really
was
asleep
weyrother
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
too
busy
to
lose
a
moment
glanced
at
kutuzov
and
having
convinced
himself
that
he
was
asleep
took
up
a
paper
and
in
a
loud
monotonous
voice
began
to
read
out
the
dispositions
for
the
impending
battle
under
a
heading
which
he
also
read
out
dispositions
for
an
attack
on
the
enemy
position
behind
kobelnitz
and
sokolnitz
november
the
dispositions
were
very
complicated
and
difficult
they
began
as
follows
as
the
enemy
s
left
wing
rests
on
wooded
hills
and
his
right
extends
along
kobelnitz
and
sokolnitz
behind
the
ponds
that
are
there
while
we
on
the
other
hand
with
our
left
wing
by
far
outflank
his
right
it
is
advantageous
to
attack
the
enemy
s
latter
wing
especially
if
we
occupy
the
villages
of
sokolnitz
and
kobelnitz
whereby
we
can
both
fall
on
his
flank
and
pursue
him
over
the
plain
between
schlappanitz
and
the
thuerassa
forest
avoiding
the
defiles
of
schlappanitz
and
bellowitz
which
cover
the
enemy
s
front
for
this
object
it
is
necessary
that
the
first
column
marches
the
second
column
marches
the
third
column
marches
and
so
on
read
weyrother
the
generals
seemed
to
listen
reluctantly
to
the
difficult
dispositions
the
tall
fair
haired
general
buxhowden
stood
leaning
his
back
against
the
wall
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
burning
candle
and
seemed
not
to
listen
or
even
to
wish
to
be
thought
to
listen
exactly
opposite
weyrother
with
his
glistening
wide
open
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
his
mustache
twisted
upwards
sat
the
ruddy
miloradovich
in
a
military
pose
his
elbows
turned
outwards
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
his
shoulders
raised
he
remained
stubbornly
silent
gazing
at
weyrother
s
face
and
only
turned
away
his
eyes
when
the
austrian
chief
of
staff
finished
reading
then
miloradovich
looked
round
significantly
at
the
other
generals
but
one
could
not
tell
from
that
significant
look
whether
he
agreed
or
disagreed
and
was
satisfied
or
not
with
the
arrangements
next
to
weyrother
sat
count
langeron
who
with
a
subtle
smile
that
never
left
his
typically
southern
french
face
during
the
whole
time
of
the
reading
gazed
at
his
delicate
fingers
which
rapidly
twirled
by
its
corners
a
gold
snuffbox
on
which
was
a
portrait
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
longest
sentences
he
stopped
the
rotary
motion
of
the
snuffbox
raised
his
head
and
with
inimical
politeness
lurking
in
the
corners
of
his
thin
lips
interrupted
weyrother
wishing
to
say
something
but
the
austrian
general
continuing
to
read
frowned
angrily
and
jerked
his
elbows
as
if
to
say
you
can
tell
me
your
views
later
but
now
be
so
good
as
to
look
at
the
map
and
listen
langeron
lifted
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
perplexity
turned
round
to
miloradovich
as
if
seeking
an
explanation
but
meeting
the
latter
s
impressive
but
meaningless
gaze
drooped
his
eyes
sadly
and
again
took
to
twirling
his
snuffbox
a
geography
lesson
he
muttered
as
if
to
himself
but
loud
enough
to
be
heard
przebyszewski
with
respectful
but
dignified
politeness
held
his
hand
to
his
ear
toward
weyrother
with
the
air
of
a
man
absorbed
in
attention
dohkturov
a
little
man
sat
opposite
weyrother
with
an
assiduous
and
modest
mien
and
stooping
over
the
outspread
map
conscientiously
studied
the
dispositions
and
the
unfamiliar
locality
he
asked
weyrother
several
times
to
repeat
words
he
had
not
clearly
heard
and
the
difficult
names
of
villages
weyrother
complied
and
dohkturov
noted
them
down
when
the
reading
which
lasted
more
than
an
hour
was
over
langeron
again
brought
his
snuffbox
to
rest
and
without
looking
at
weyrother
or
at
anyone
in
particular
began
to
say
how
difficult
it
was
to
carry
out
such
a
plan
in
which
the
enemy
s
position
was
assumed
to
be
known
whereas
it
was
perhaps
not
known
since
the
enemy
was
in
movement
langeron
s
objections
were
valid
but
it
was
obvious
that
their
chief
aim
was
to
show
general
weyrother
who
had
read
his
dispositions
with
as
much
self
confidence
as
if
he
were
addressing
school
children
that
he
had
to
do
not
with
fools
but
with
men
who
could
teach
him
something
in
military
matters
when
the
monotonous
sound
of
weyrother
s
voice
ceased
kutuzov
opened
his
eye
as
a
miller
wakes
up
when
the
soporific
drone
of
the
mill
wheel
is
interrupted
he
listened
to
what
langeron
said
as
if
remarking
so
you
are
still
at
that
silly
business
quickly
closed
his
eye
again
and
let
his
head
sink
still
lower
langeron
trying
as
virulently
as
possible
to
sting
weyrother
s
vanity
as
author
of
the
military
plan
argued
that
bonaparte
might
easily
attack
instead
of
being
attacked
and
so
render
the
whole
of
this
plan
perfectly
worthless
weyrother
met
all
objections
with
a
firm
and
contemptuous
smile
evidently
prepared
beforehand
to
meet
all
objections
be
they
what
they
might
if
he
could
attack
us
he
would
have
done
so
today
said
he
so
you
think
he
is
powerless
said
langeron
he
has
forty
thousand
men
at
most
replied
weyrother
with
the
smile
of
a
doctor
to
whom
an
old
wife
wishes
to
explain
the
treatment
of
a
case
in
that
case
he
is
inviting
his
doom
by
awaiting
our
attack
said
langeron
with
a
subtly
ironical
smile
again
glancing
round
for
support
to
miloradovich
who
was
near
him
but
miloradovich
was
at
that
moment
evidently
thinking
of
anything
rather
than
of
what
the
generals
were
disputing
about
ma
foi
said
he
tomorrow
we
shall
see
all
that
on
the
battlefield
weyrother
again
gave
that
smile
which
seemed
to
say
that
to
him
it
was
strange
and
ridiculous
to
meet
objections
from
russian
generals
and
to
have
to
prove
to
them
what
he
had
not
merely
convinced
himself
of
but
had
also
convinced
the
sovereign
emperors
of
the
enemy
has
quenched
his
fires
and
a
continual
noise
is
heard
from
his
camp
said
he
what
does
that
mean
either
he
is
retreating
which
is
the
only
thing
we
need
fear
or
he
is
changing
his
position
he
smiled
ironically
but
even
if
he
also
took
up
a
position
in
the
thuerassa
he
merely
saves
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
all
our
arrangements
to
the
minutest
detail
remain
the
same
how
is
that
began
prince
andrew
who
had
for
long
been
waiting
an
opportunity
to
express
his
doubts
kutuzov
here
woke
up
coughed
heavily
and
looked
round
at
the
generals
gentlemen
the
dispositions
for
tomorrow
or
rather
for
today
for
it
is
past
midnight
cannot
now
be
altered
said
he
you
have
heard
them
and
we
shall
all
do
our
duty
but
before
a
battle
there
is
nothing
more
important
he
paused
than
to
have
a
good
sleep
he
moved
as
if
to
rise
the
generals
bowed
and
retired
it
was
past
midnight
prince
andrew
went
out
the
council
of
war
at
which
prince
andrew
had
not
been
able
to
express
his
opinion
as
he
had
hoped
to
left
on
him
a
vague
and
uneasy
impression
whether
dolgorukov
and
weyrother
or
kutuzov
langeron
and
the
others
who
did
not
approve
of
the
plan
of
attack
were
right
he
did
not
know
but
was
it
really
not
possible
for
kutuzov
to
state
his
views
plainly
to
the
emperor
is
it
possible
that
on
account
of
court
and
personal
considerations
tens
of
thousands
of
lives
and
my
life
my
life
he
thought
must
be
risked
yes
it
is
very
likely
that
i
shall
be
killed
tomorrow
he
thought
and
suddenly
at
this
thought
of
death
a
whole
series
of
most
distant
most
intimate
memories
rose
in
his
imagination
he
remembered
his
last
parting
from
his
father
and
his
wife
he
remembered
the
days
when
he
first
loved
her
he
thought
of
her
pregnancy
and
felt
sorry
for
her
and
for
himself
and
in
a
nervously
emotional
and
softened
mood
he
went
out
of
the
hut
in
which
he
was
billeted
with
nesvitski
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
before
it
the
night
was
foggy
and
through
the
fog
the
moonlight
gleamed
mysteriously
yes
tomorrow
tomorrow
he
thought
tomorrow
everything
may
be
over
for
me
all
these
memories
will
be
no
more
none
of
them
will
have
any
meaning
for
me
tomorrow
perhaps
even
certainly
i
have
a
presentiment
that
for
the
first
time
i
shall
have
to
show
all
i
can
do
and
his
fancy
pictured
the
battle
its
loss
the
concentration
of
fighting
at
one
point
and
the
hesitation
of
all
the
commanders
and
then
that
happy
moment
that
toulon
for
which
he
had
so
long
waited
presents
itself
to
him
at
last
he
firmly
and
clearly
expresses
his
opinion
to
kutuzov
to
weyrother
and
to
the
emperors
all
are
struck
by
the
justness
of
his
views
but
no
one
undertakes
to
carry
them
out
so
he
takes
a
regiment
a
division
stipulates
that
no
one
is
to
interfere
with
his
arrangements
leads
his
division
to
the
decisive
point
and
gains
the
victory
alone
but
death
and
suffering
suggested
another
voice
prince
andrew
however
did
not
answer
that
voice
and
went
on
dreaming
of
his
triumphs
the
dispositions
for
the
next
battle
are
planned
by
him
alone
nominally
he
is
only
an
adjutant
on
kutuzov
s
staff
but
he
does
everything
alone
the
next
battle
is
won
by
him
alone
kutuzov
is
removed
and
he
is
appointed
well
and
then
asked
the
other
voice
if
before
that
you
are
not
ten
times
wounded
killed
or
betrayed
well
what
then
well
then
prince
andrew
answered
himself
i
don
t
know
what
will
happen
and
don
t
want
to
know
and
can
t
but
if
i
want
this
want
glory
want
to
be
known
to
men
want
to
be
loved
by
them
it
is
not
my
fault
that
i
want
it
and
want
nothing
but
that
and
live
only
for
that
yes
for
that
alone
i
shall
never
tell
anyone
but
oh
god
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
nothing
but
fame
and
men
s
esteem
death
wounds
the
loss
of
family
i
fear
nothing
and
precious
and
dear
as
many
persons
are
to
me
father
sister
wife
those
dearest
to
me
yet
dreadful
and
unnatural
as
it
seems
i
would
give
them
all
at
once
for
a
moment
of
glory
of
triumph
over
men
of
love
from
men
i
don
t
know
and
never
shall
know
for
the
love
of
these
men
here
he
thought
as
he
listened
to
voices
in
kutuzov
s
courtyard
the
voices
were
those
of
the
orderlies
who
were
packing
up
one
voice
probably
a
coachman
s
was
teasing
kutuzov
s
old
cook
whom
prince
andrew
knew
and
who
was
called
tit
he
was
saying
tit
i
say
tit
well

the
old
man

a
bit
said
the
wag
oh
go
to
the
devil
called
out
a
voice
drowned
by
the
laughter
of
the
orderlies
and
servants
all
the
same
i
love
and
value
nothing
but
triumph
over
them
all
i
value
this
mystic
power
and
glory
that
is
floating
here
above
me
in

chapter
xiii
that
same
night
rostov
was
with
a
platoon
on
skirmishing
duty
in
front
of
bagration
s
detachment
his
hussars
were
placed
along
the
line
in
couples
and
he
himself
rode
along
the
line
trying
to
master
the
sleepiness
that
kept
coming
over
him
an
enormous
space
with
our
army
s
campfires
dimly
glowing
in
the
fog
could
be
seen
behind
him
in
front
of
him
was
misty
darkness
rostov
could
see
nothing
peer
as
he
would
into
that
foggy
distance
now
something
gleamed
gray
now
there
was
something
black
now
little
lights
seemed
to
glimmer
where
the
enemy
ought
to
be
now
he
fancied
it
was
only
something
in
his
own
eyes
his
eyes
kept
closing
and
in
his
fancy
appeared
now
the
emperor
now
denisov
and
now
moscow
memories
and
he
again
hurriedly
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
close
before
him
the
head
and
ears
of
the
horse
he
was
riding
and
sometimes
when
he
came
within
six
paces
of
them
the
black
figures
of
hussars
but
in
the
distance
was
still
the
same
misty
darkness
why
not
it
might
easily
happen
thought
rostov
that
the
emperor
will
meet
me
and
give
me
an
order
as
he
would
to
any
other
officer
he
ll
say
go
and
find
out
what
s
there
there
are
many
stories
of
his
getting
to
know
an
officer
in
just
such
a
chance
way
and
attaching
him
to
himself
what
if
he
gave
me
a
place
near
him
oh
how
i
would
guard
him
how
i
would
tell
him
the
truth
how
i
would
unmask
his
deceivers
and
in
order
to
realize
vividly
his
love
devotion
to
the
sovereign
rostov
pictured
to
himself
an
enemy
or
a
deceitful
german
whom
he
would
not
only
kill
with
pleasure
but
whom
he
would
slap
in
the
face
before
the
emperor
suddenly
a
distant
shout
aroused
him
he
started
and
opened
his
eyes
where
am
i
oh
yes
in
the
skirmishing
line
pass
and
watchword
shaft
olmutz
what
a
nuisance
that
our
squadron
will
be
in
reserve
tomorrow
he
thought
i
ll
ask
leave
to
go
to
the
front
this
may
be
my
only
chance
of
seeing
the
emperor
it
won
t
be
long
now
before
i
am
off
duty
i
ll
take
another
turn
and
when
i
get
back
i
ll
go
to
the
general
and
ask
him
he
readjusted
himself
in
the
saddle
and
touched
up
his
horse
to
ride
once
more
round
his
hussars
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
getting
lighter
to
the
left
he
saw
a
sloping
descent
lit
up
and
facing
it
a
black
knoll
that
seemed
as
steep
as
a
wall
on
this
knoll
there
was
a
white
patch
that
rostov
could
not
at
all
make
out
was
it
a
glade
in
the
wood
lit
up
by
the
moon
or
some
unmelted
snow
or
some
white
houses
he
even
thought
something
moved
on
that
white
spot
i
expect
it
s
snow
that
spot
a
spot
une
tache
he
thought
there
now
it
s
not
a
tache
natasha
sister
black
eyes
na
tasha
won
t
she
be
surprised
when
i
tell
her
how
i
ve
seen
the
emperor
natasha
take
my
sabretache
keep
to
the
right
your
honor
there
are
bushes
here
came
the
voice
of
an
hussar
past
whom
rostov
was
riding
in
the
act
of
falling
asleep
rostov
lifted
his
head
that
had
sunk
almost
to
his
horse
s
mane
and
pulled
up
beside
the
hussar
he
was
succumbing
to
irresistible
youthful
childish
drowsiness
but
what
was
i
thinking
i
mustn
t
forget
how
shall
i
speak
to
the
emperor
no
that
s
not
it
that
s
tomorrow
oh
yes
natasha
sabretache
saber
them
whom
the
hussars
ah
the
hussars
with
mustaches
along
the
tverskaya
street
rode
the
hussar
with
mustaches
i
thought
about
him
too
just
opposite
guryev
s
house
old
guryev
oh
but
denisov
s
a
fine
fellow
but
that
s
all
nonsense
the
chief
thing
is
that
the
emperor
is
here
how
he
looked
at
me
and
wished
to
say
something
but
dared
not
no
it
was
i
who
dared
not
but
that
s
nonsense
the
chief
thing
is
not
to
forget
the
important
thing
i
was
thinking
of
yes
na
tasha
sabretache
oh
yes
yes
that
s
right
and
his
head
once
more
sank
to
his
horse
s
neck
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
being
fired
at
what
what
what
cut
them
down
what
said
rostov
waking
up
at
the
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
he
heard
in
front
of
him
where
the
enemy
was
the
long
drawn
shouts
of
thousands
of
voices
his
horse
and
the
horse
of
the
hussar
near
him
pricked
their
ears
at
these
shouts
over
there
where
the
shouting
came
from
a
fire
flared
up
and
went
out
again
then
another
and
all
along
the
french
line
on
the
hill
fires
flared
up
and
the
shouting
grew
louder
and
louder
rostov
could
hear
the
sound
of
french
words
but
could
not
distinguish
them
the
din
of
many
voices
was
too
great
all
he
could
hear
was
ahahah
and
rrrr
what
s
that
what
do
you
make
of
it
said
rostov
to
the
hussar
beside
him
that
must
be
the
enemy
s
camp
the
hussar
did
not
reply
why
don
t
you
hear
it
rostov
asked
again
after
waiting
for
a
reply
who
can
tell
your
honor
replied
the
hussar
reluctantly
from
the
direction
it
must
be
the
enemy
repeated
rostov
it
may
be
he
or
it
may
be
nothing
muttered
the
hussar
it
s
dark
steady
he
cried
to
his
fidgeting
horse
rostov
s
horse
was
also
getting
restive
it
pawed
the
frozen
ground
pricking
its
ears
at
the
noise
and
looking
at
the
lights
the
shouting
grew
still
louder
and
merged
into
a
general
roar
that
only
an
army
of
several
thousand
men
could
produce
the
lights
spread
farther
and
farther
probably
along
the
line
of
the
french
camp
rostov
no
longer
wanted
to
sleep
the
gay
triumphant
shouting
of
the
enemy
army
had
a
stimulating
effect
on
him
vive
l
empereur
l
empereur
he
now
heard
distinctly
they
can
t
be
far
off
probably
just
beyond
the
stream
he
said
to
the
hussar
beside
him
the
hussar
only
sighed
without
replying
and
coughed
angrily
the
sound
of
horse
s
hoofs
approaching
at
a
trot
along
the
line
of
hussars
was
heard
and
out
of
the
foggy
darkness
the
figure
of
a
sergeant
of
hussars
suddenly
appeared
looming
huge
as
an
elephant
your
honor
the
generals
said
the
sergeant
riding
up
to
rostov
rostov
still
looking
round
toward
the
fires
and
the
shouts
rode
with
the
sergeant
to
meet
some
mounted
men
who
were
riding
along
the
line
one
was
on
a
white
horse
prince
bagration
and
prince
dolgorukov
with
their
adjutants
had
come
to
witness
the
curious
phenomenon
of
the
lights
and
shouts
in
the
enemy
s
camp
rostov
rode
up
to
bagration
reported
to
him
and
then
joined
the
adjutants
listening
to
what
the
generals
were
saying
believe
me
said
prince
dolgorukov
addressing
bagration
it
is
nothing
but
a
trick
he
has
retreated
and
ordered
the
rearguard
to
kindle
fires
and
make
a
noise
to
deceive
us
hardly
said
bagration
i
saw
them
this
evening
on
that
knoll
if
they
had
retreated
they
would
have
withdrawn
from
that
too
officer
said
bagration
to
rostov
are
the
enemy
s
skirmishers
still
there
they
were
there
this
evening
but
now
i
don
t
know
your
excellency
shall
i
go
with
some
of
my
hussars
to
see
replied
rostov
bagration
stopped
and
before
replying
tried
to
see
rostov
s
face
in
the
mist
well
go
and
see
he
said
after
a
pause
yes
sir
rostov
spurred
his
horse
called
to
sergeant
fedchenko
and
two
other
hussars
told
them
to
follow
him
and
trotted
downhill
in
the
direction
from
which
the
shouting
came
he
felt
both
frightened
and
pleased
to
be
riding
alone
with
three
hussars
into
that
mysterious
and
dangerous
misty
distance
where
no
one
had
been
before
him
bagration
called
to
him
from
the
hill
not
to
go
beyond
the
stream
but
rostov
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
did
not
stop
but
rode
on
and
on
continually
mistaking
bushes
for
trees
and
gullies
for
men
and
continually
discovering
his
mistakes
having
descended
the
hill
at
a
trot
he
no
longer
saw
either
our
own
or
the
enemy
s
fires
but
heard
the
shouting
of
the
french
more
loudly
and
distinctly
in
the
valley
he
saw
before
him
something
like
a
river
but
when
he
reached
it
he
found
it
was
a
road
having
come
out
onto
the
road
he
reined
in
his
horse
hesitating
whether
to
ride
along
it
or
cross
it
and
ride
over
the
black
field
up
the
hillside
to
keep
to
the
road
which
gleamed
white
in
the
mist
would
have
been
safer
because
it
would
be
easier
to
see
people
coming
along
it
follow
me
said
he
crossed
the
road
and
began
riding
up
the
hill
at
a
gallop
toward
the
point
where
the
french
pickets
had
been
standing
that
evening
your
honor
there
he
is
cried
one
of
the
hussars
behind
him
and
before
rostov
had
time
to
make
out
what
the
black
thing
was
that
had
suddenly
appeared
in
the
fog
there
was
a
flash
followed
by
a
report
and
a
bullet
whizzing
high
up
in
the
mist
with
a
plaintive
sound
passed
out
of
hearing
another
musket
missed
fire
but
flashed
in
the
pan
rostov
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
four
more
reports
followed
at
intervals
and
the
bullets
passed
somewhere
in
the
fog
singing
in
different
tones
rostov
reined
in
his
horse
whose
spirits
had
risen
like
his
own
at
the
firing
and
went
back
at
a
footpace
well
some
more
some
more
a
merry
voice
was
saying
in
his
soul
but
no
more
shots
came
only
when
approaching
bagration
did
rostov
let
his
horse
gallop
again
and
with
his
hand
at
the
salute
rode
up
to
the
general
dolgorukov
was
still
insisting
that
the
french
had
retreated
and
had
only
lit
fires
to
deceive
us
what
does
that
prove
he
was
saying
as
rostov
rode
up
they
might
retreat
and
leave
the
pickets
it
s
plain
that
they
have
not
all
gone
yet
prince
said
bagration
wait
till
tomorrow
morning
we
ll
find
out
everything
tomorrow
the
picket
is
still
on
the
hill
your
excellency
just
where
it
was
in
the
evening
reported
rostov
stooping
forward
with
his
hand
at
the
salute
and
unable
to
repress
the
smile
of
delight
induced
by
his
ride
and
especially
by
the
sound
of
the
bullets
very
good
very
good
said
bagration
thank
you
officer
your
excellency
said
rostov
may
i
ask
a
favor
what
is
it
tomorrow
our
squadron
is
to
be
in
reserve
may
i
ask
to
be
attached
to
the
first
squadron
what
s
your
name
count
rostov
oh
very
well
you
may
stay
in
attendance
on
me
count
ilya
rostov
s
son
asked
dolgorukov
but
rostov
did
not
reply
then
i
may
reckon
on
it
your
excellency
i
will
give
the
order
tomorrow
very
likely
i
may
be
sent
with
some
message
to
the
emperor
thought
rostov
thank
god
the
fires
and
shouting
in
the
enemy
s
army
were
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
while
napoleon
s
proclamation
was
being
read
to
the
troops
the
emperor
himself
rode
round
his
bivouacs
the
soldiers
on
seeing
him
lit
wisps
of
straw
and
ran
after
him
shouting
vive
l
empereur
napoleon
s
proclamation
was
as
follows
soldiers
the
russian
army
is
advancing
against
you
to
avenge
the
austrian
army
of
ulm
they
are
the
same
battalions
you
broke
at
hollabrunn
and
have
pursued
ever
since
to
this
place
the
position
we
occupy
is
a
strong
one
and
while
they
are
marching
to
go
round
me
on
the
right
they
will
expose
a
flank
to
me
soldiers
i
will
myself
direct
your
battalions
i
will
keep
out
of
fire
if
you
with
your
habitual
valor
carry
disorder
and
confusion
into
the
enemy
s
ranks
but
should
victory
be
in
doubt
even
for
a
moment
you
will
see
your
emperor
exposing
himself
to
the
first
blows
of
the
enemy
for
there
must
be
no
doubt
of
victory
especially
on
this
day
when
what
is
at
stake
is
the
honor
of
the
french
infantry
so
necessary
to
the
honor
of
our
nation
do
not
break
your
ranks
on
the
plea
of
removing
the
wounded
let
every
man
be
fully
imbued
with
the
thought
that
we
must
defeat
these
hirelings
of
england
inspired
by
such
hatred
of
our
nation
this
victory
will
conclude
our
campaign
and
we
can
return
to
winter
quarters
where
fresh
french
troops
who
are
being
raised
in
france
will
join
us
and
the
peace
i
shall
conclude
will
be
worthy
of
my
people
of
you
and
of
myself

showed
himself

surrounded
by
the
same
decks
masts
and
rigging
of
his
ship
so
the
soldier
always
has
around
him
the
same
comrades
the
same
ranks
the
same
sergeant
major
ivan
mitrich
the
same
company
dog
jack
and
the
same
commanders
the
sailor
rarely
cares
to
know
the
latitude
in
which
his
ship
is
sailing
but
on
the
day
of
battle
heaven
knows
how
and
whence
a
stern
note
of
which
all
are
conscious
sounds
in
the
moral
atmosphere
of
an
army
announcing
the
approach
of
something
decisive
and
solemn
and
awakening
in
the
men
an
unusual
curiosity
on
the
day
of
battle
the
soldiers
excitedly
try
to
get
beyond
the
interests
of
their
regiment
they
listen
intently
look
about
and
eagerly
ask
concerning
what
is
going
on
around
them
the
fog
had
grown
so
dense
that
though
it
was
growing
light
they
could
not
see
ten
paces
ahead
bushes
looked
like
gigantic
trees
and
level
ground
like
cliffs
and
slopes
anywhere
on
any
side
one
might
encounter
an
enemy
invisible
ten
paces
off
but
the
columns
advanced
for
a
long
time
always
in
the
same
fog
descending
and
ascending
hills
avoiding
gardens
and
enclosures
going
over
new
and
unknown
ground
and
nowhere
encountering
the
enemy
on
the
contrary
the
soldiers
became
aware
that
in
front
behind
and
on
all
sides
other
russian
columns
were
moving
in
the
same
direction
every
soldier
felt
glad
to
know
that
to
the
unknown
place
where
he
was
going
many
more
of
our
men
were
going
too
there
now
the
kurskies
have
also
gone
past
was
being
said
in
the
ranks
it
s
wonderful
what
a
lot
of
our
troops
have
gathered
lads
last
night
i
looked
at
the
campfires
and
there
was
no
end
of
them
a
regular
moscow
though
none
of
the
column
commanders
rode
up
to
the
ranks
or
talked
to
the
men
the
commanders
as
we
saw
at
the
council
of
war
were
out
of
humor
and
dissatisfied
with
the
affair
and
so
did
not
exert
themselves
to
cheer
the
men
but
merely
carried
out
the
orders
yet
the
troops
marched
gaily
as
they
always
do
when
going
into
action
especially
to
an
attack
but
when
they
had
marched
for
about
an
hour
in
the
dense
fog
the
greater
part
of
the
men
had
to
halt
and
an
unpleasant
consciousness
of
some
dislocation
and
blunder
spread
through
the
ranks
how
such
a
consciousness
is
communicated
is
very
difficult
to
define
but
it
certainly
is
communicated
very
surely
and
flows
rapidly
imperceptibly
and
irrepressibly
as
water
does
in
a
creek
had
the
russian
army
been
alone
without
any
allies
it
might
perhaps
have
been
a
long
time
before
this
consciousness
of
mismanagement
became
a
general
conviction
but
as
it
was
the
disorder
was
readily
and
naturally
attributed
to
the
stupid
germans
and
everyone
was
convinced
that
a
dangerous
muddle
had
been
occasioned
by
the
sausage
eaters
why
have
we
stopped
is
the
way
blocked
or
have
we
already
come
up
against
the
french
no
one
can
t
hear
them
they
d
be
firing
if
we
had
they
were
in
a
hurry
enough
to
start
us
and
now
here
we
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
field
without
rhyme
or
reason
it
s
all
those
damned
germans
muddling
what
stupid
devils
yes
i
d
send
them
on
in
front
but
no
fear
they
re
crowding
up
behind
and
now
here
we
stand
hungry
i
say
shall
we
soon
be
clear
they
say
the
cavalry
are
blocking
the
way
said
an
officer
ah
those
damned
germans
they
don
t
know
their
own
country
said
another
what
division
are
you
shouted
an
adjutant
riding
up
the
eighteenth
then
why
are
you
here
you
should
have
gone
on
long
ago
now
you
won
t
get
there
till
evening
what
stupid
orders
they
don
t
themselves
know
what
they
are
doing
said
the
officer
and
rode
off
then
a
general
rode
past
shouting
something
angrily
not
in
russian
tafa
lafa
but
what
he
s
jabbering
no
one
can
make
out
said
a
soldier
mimicking
the
general
who
had
ridden
away
i
d
shoot
them
the
scoundrels
we
were
ordered
to
be
at
the
place
before
nine
but
we
haven
t
got
halfway
fine
orders
was
being
repeated
on
different
sides
and
the
feeling
of
energy
with
which
the
troops
had
started
began
to
turn
into
vexation
and
anger
at
the
stupid
arrangements
and
at
the
germans
the
cause
of
the
confusion
was
that
while
the
austrian
cavalry
was
moving
toward
our
left
flank
the
higher
command
found
that
our
center
was
too
far
separated
from
our
right
flank
and
the
cavalry
were
all
ordered
to
turn
back
to
the
right
several
thousand
cavalry
crossed
in
front
of
the
infantry
who
had
to
wait
at
the
front
an
altercation
occurred
between
an
austrian
guide
and
a
russian
general
the
general
shouted
a
demand
that
the
cavalry
should
be
halted
the
austrian
argued
that
not
he
but
the
higher
command
was
to
blame
the
troops
meanwhile
stood
growing
listless
and
dispirited
after
an
hour
s
delay
they
at
last
moved
on
descending
the
hill
the
fog
that
was
dispersing
on
the
hill
lay
still
more
densely
below
where
they
were
descending
in
front
in
the
fog
a
shot
was
heard
and
then
another
at
first
irregularly
at
varying
intervals
trata
tat
and
then
more
and
more
regularly
and
rapidly
and
the
action
at
the
goldbach
stream
began
not
expecting
to
come
on
the
enemy
down
by
the
stream
and
having
stumbled
on
him
in
the
fog
hearing
no
encouraging
word
from
their
commanders
and
with
a
consciousness
of
being
too
late
spreading
through
the
ranks
and
above
all
being
unable
to
see
anything
in
front
or
around
them
in
the
thick
fog
the
russians
exchanged
shots
with
the
enemy
lazily
and
advanced
and
again
halted
receiving
no
timely
orders
from
the
officers
or
adjutants
who
wandered
about
in
the
fog
in
those
unknown
surroundings
unable
to
find
their
own
regiments
in
this
way
the
action
began
for
the
first
second
and
third
columns
which
had
gone
down
into
the
valley
the
fourth
column
with
which
kutuzov
was
stood
on
the
pratzen
heights
below
where
the
fight
was
beginning
there
was
still
thick
fog
on
the
higher
ground
it
was
clearing
but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
what
was
going
on
in
front
whether
all
the
enemy
forces
were
as
we
supposed
six
miles
away
or
whether
they
were
near
by
in
that
sea
of
mist
no
one
knew
till
after
eight
o
clock
it
was
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
fog
lay
unbroken
like
a
sea
down
below
but
higher
up
at
the
village
of
schlappanitz
where
napoleon
stood
with
his
marshals
around
him
it
was
quite
light
above
him
was
a
clear
blue
sky
and
the
sun
s
vast
orb
quivered
like
a
huge
hollow
crimson
float
on
the
surface
of
that
milky
sea
of
mist
the
whole
french
army
and
even
napoleon
himself
with
his
staff
were
not
on
the
far
side
of
the
streams
and
hollows
of
sokolnitz
and
schlappanitz
beyond
which
we
intended
to
take
up
our
position
and
begin
the
action
but
were
on
this
side
so
close
to
our
own
forces
that
napoleon
with
the
naked
eye
could
distinguish
a
mounted
man
from
one
on
foot
napoleon
in
the
blue
cloak
which
he
had
worn
on
his
italian
campaign
sat
on
his
small
gray
arab
horse
a
little
in
front
of
his
marshals
he
gazed
silently
at
the
hills
which
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
sea
of
mist
and
on
which
the
russian
troops
were
moving
in
the
distance
and
he
listened
to
the
sounds
of
firing
in
the
valley
not
a
single
muscle
of
his
face
which
in
those
days
was
still
thin
moved
his
gleaming
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
one
spot
his
predictions
were
being
justified
part
of
the
russian
force
had
already
descended
into
the
valley
toward
the
ponds
and
lakes
and
part
were
leaving
these
pratzen
heights
which
he
intended
to
attack
and
regarded
as
the
key
to
the
position
he
saw
over
the
mist
that
in
a
hollow
between
two
hills
near
the
village
of
pratzen
the
russian
columns
their
bayonets
glittering
were
moving
continuously
in
one
direction
toward
the
valley
and
disappearing
one
after
another
into
the
mist
from
information
he
had
received
the
evening
before
from
the
sound
of
wheels
and
footsteps
heard
by
the
outposts
during
the
night
by
the
disorderly
movement
of
the
russian
columns
and
from
all
indications
he
saw
clearly
that
the
allies
believed
him
to
be
far
away
in
front
of
them
and
that
the
columns
moving
near
pratzen
constituted
the
center
of
the
russian
army
and
that
that
center
was
already
sufficiently
weakened
to
be
successfully
attacked
but
still
he
did
not
begin
the
engagement
today
was
a
great
day
for
him
the
anniversary
of
his
coronation
before
dawn
he
had
slept
for
a
few
hours
and
refreshed
vigorous
and
in
good
spirits
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
out
into
the
field
in
that
happy
mood
in
which
everything
seems
possible
and
everything
succeeds
he
sat
motionless
looking
at
the
heights
visible
above
the
mist
and
his
cold
face
wore
that
special
look
of
confident
self
complacent
happiness
that
one
sees
on
the
face
of
a
boy
happily
in
love
the
marshals
stood
behind
him
not
venturing
to
distract
his
attention
he
looked
now
at
the
pratzen
heights
now
at
the
sun
floating
up
out
of
the
mist
when
the
sun
had
entirely
emerged
from
the
fog
and
fields
and
mist
were
aglow
with
dazzling
light
as
if
he
had
only
awaited
this
to
begin
the
action
he
drew
the
glove
from
his
shapely
white
hand
made
a
sign
with
it
to
the
marshals
and
ordered
the
action
to
begin
the
marshals
accompanied
by
adjutants
galloped
off
in
different
directions
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
chief
forces
of
the
french
army
moved
rapidly
toward
those
pratzen
heights
which
were
being
more
and
more
denuded
by
russian
troops
moving
down
the
valley
to
their
left
chapter
xv
at
eight
o
clock
kutuzov
rode
to
pratzen
at
the
head
of
the
fourth
column
miloradovich
s
the
one
that
was
to
take
the
place
of
przebyszewski
s
and
langeron
s
columns
which
had
already
gone
down
into
the
valley
he
greeted
the
men
of
the
foremost
regiment
and
gave
them
the
order
to
march
thereby
indicating
that
he
intended
to
lead
that
column
himself
when
he
had
reached
the
village
of
pratzen
he
halted
prince
andrew
was
behind
among
the
immense
number
forming
the
commander
in
chief
s
suite
he
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
and
irritation
though
controlledly
calm
as
a
man
is
at
the
approach
of
a
long
awaited
moment
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
this
was
the
day
of
his
toulon
or
his
bridge
of
arcola
how
it
would
come
about
he
did
not
know
but
he
felt
sure
it
would
do
so
the
locality
and
the
position
of
our
troops
were
known
to
him
as
far
as
they
could
be
known
to
anyone
in
our
army
his
own
strategic
plan
which
obviously
could
not
now
be
carried
out
was
forgotten
now
entering
into
weyrother
s
plan
prince
andrew
considered
possible
contingencies
and
formed
new
projects
such
as
might
call
for
his
rapidity
of
perception
and
decision
to
the
left
down
below
in
the
mist
the
musketry
fire
of
unseen
forces
could
be
heard
it
was
there
prince
andrew
thought
the
fight
would
concentrate
there
we
shall
encounter
difficulties
and
there
thought
he
i
shall
be
sent
with
a
brigade
or
division
and
there
standard
in
hand
i
shall
go
forward
and
break
whatever
is
in
front
of
me
he
could
not
look
calmly
at
the
standards
of
the
passing
battalions
seeing
them
he
kept
thinking
that
may
be
the
very
standard
with
which
i
shall
lead
the
army
in
the
morning
all
that
was
left
of
the
night
mist
on
the
heights
was
a
hoar
frost
now
turning
to
dew
but
in
the
valleys
it
still
lay
like
a
milk
white
sea
nothing
was
visible
in
the
valley
to
the
left
into
which
our
troops
had
descended
and
from
whence
came
the
sounds
of
firing
above
the
heights
was
the
dark
clear
sky
and
to
the
right
the
vast
orb
of
the
sun
in
front
far
off
on
the
farther
shore
of
that
sea
of
mist
some
wooded
hills
were
discernible
and
it
was
there
the
enemy
probably
was
for
something
could
be
descried
on
the
right
the
guards
were
entering
the
misty
region
with
a
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
and
now
and
then
a
gleam
of
bayonets
to
the
left
beyond
the
village
similar
masses
of
cavalry
came
up
and
disappeared
in
the
sea
of
mist
in
front
and
behind
moved
infantry
the
commander
in
chief
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
village
letting
the
troops
pass
by
him
that
morning
kutuzov
seemed
worn
and
irritable
the
infantry
passing
before
him
came
to
a
halt
without
any
command
being
given
apparently
obstructed
by
something
in
front
do
order
them
to
form
into
battalion
columns
and
go
round
the
village
he
said
angrily
to
a
general
who
had
ridden
up
don
t
you
understand
your
excellency
my
dear
sir
that
you
must
not
defile
through
narrow
village
streets
when
we
are
marching
against
the
enemy
i
intended
to
re
form
them
beyond
the
village
your
excellency
answered
the
general
kutuzov
laughed
bitterly
you
ll
make
a
fine
thing
of
it
deploying
in
sight
of
the
enemy
very
fine
the
enemy
is
still
far
away
your
excellency
according
to
the
dispositions
the
dispositions
exclaimed
kutuzov
bitterly
who
told
you
that
kindly
do
as
you
are
ordered
yes
sir
my
dear
fellow
nesvitski
whispered
to
prince
andrew
the
old
man
is
as
surly
as
a
dog
an
austrian
officer
in
a
white
uniform
with
green
plumes
in
his
hat
galloped
up
to
kutuzov
and
asked
in
the
emperor
s
name
had
the
fourth
column
advanced
into
action
kutuzov
turned
round
without
answering
and
his
eye
happened
to
fall
upon
prince
andrew
who
was
beside
him
seeing
him
kutuzov
s
malevolent
and
caustic
expression
softened
as
if
admitting
that
what
was
being
done
was
not
his
adjutant
s
fault
and
still
not
answering
the
austrian
adjutant
he
addressed
bolkonski
go
my
dear
fellow
and
see
whether
the
third
division
has
passed
the
village
tell
it
to
stop
and
await
my
orders
hardly
had
prince
andrew
started
than
he
stopped
him
and
ask
whether
sharpshooters
have
been
posted
he
added
what
are
they
doing
what
are
they
doing
he
murmured
to
himself
still
not
replying
to
the
austrian
prince
andrew
galloped
off
to
execute
the
order
overtaking
the
battalions
that
continued
to
advance
he
stopped
the
third
division
and
convinced
himself
that
there
really
were
no
sharpshooters
in
front
of
our
columns
the
colonel
at
the
head
of
the
regiment
was
much
surprised
at
the
commander
in
chief
s
order
to
throw
out
skirmishers
he
had
felt
perfectly
sure
that
there
were
other
troops
in
front
of
him
and
that
the
enemy
must
be
at
least
six
miles
away
there
was
really
nothing
to
be
seen
in
front
except
a
barren
descent
hidden
by
dense
mist
having
given
orders
in
the
commander
in
chief
s
name
to
rectify
this
omission
prince
andrew
galloped
back
kutuzov
still
in
the
same
place
his
stout
body
resting
heavily
in
the
saddle
with
the
lassitude
of
age
sat
yawning
wearily
with
closed
eyes
the
troops
were
no
longer
moving
but
stood
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
on
the
ground
all
right
all
right
he
said
to
prince
andrew
and
turned
to
a
general
who
watch
in
hand
was
saying
it
was
time
they
started
as
all
the
left
flank
columns
had
already
descended
plenty
of
time
your
excellency
muttered
kutuzov
in
the
midst
of
a
yawn
plenty
of
time
he
repeated
just
then
at
a
distance
behind
kutuzov
was
heard
the
sound
of
regiments
saluting
and
this
sound
rapidly
came
nearer
along
the
whole
extended
line
of
the
advancing
russian
columns
evidently
the
person
they
were
greeting
was
riding
quickly
when
the
soldiers
of
the
regiment
in
front
of
which
kutuzov
was
standing
began
to
shout
he
rode
a
little
to
one
side
and
looked
round
with
a
frown
along
the
road
from
pratzen
galloped
what
looked
like
a
squadron
of
horsemen
in
various
uniforms
two
of
them
rode
side
by
side
in
front
at
full
gallop
one
in
a
black
uniform
with
white
plumes
in
his
hat
rode
a
bobtailed
chestnut
horse
the
other
who
was
in
a
white
uniform
rode
a
black
one
these
were
the
two
emperors
followed
by
their
suites
kutuzov
affecting
the
manners
of
an
old
soldier
at
the
front
gave
the
command
attention
and
rode
up
to
the
emperors
with
a
salute
his
whole
appearance
and
manner
were
suddenly
transformed
he
put
on
the
air
of
a
subordinate
who
obeys
without
reasoning
with
an
affectation
of
respect
which
evidently
struck
alexander
unpleasantly
he
rode
up
and
saluted
this
unpleasant
impression
merely
flitted
over
the
young
and
happy
face
of
the
emperor
like
a
cloud
of
haze
across
a
clear
sky
and
vanished
after
his
illness
he
looked
rather
thinner
that
day
than
on
the
field
of
olmutz
where
bolkonski
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
abroad
but
there
was
still
the
same
bewitching
combination
of
majesty
and
mildness
in
his
fine
gray
eyes
and
on
his
delicate
lips
the
same
capacity
for
varying
expression
and
the
same
prevalent
appearance
of
goodhearted
innocent
youth
at
the
olmutz
review
he
had
seemed
more
majestic
here
he
seemed
brighter
and
more
energetic
he
was
slightly
flushed
after
galloping
two
miles
and
reining
in
his
horse
he
sighed
restfully
and
looked
round
at
the
faces
of
his
suite
young
and
animated
as
his
own
czartoryski
novosiltsev
prince
volkonsky
strogonov
and
the
others
all
richly
dressed
gay
young
men
on
splendid
well
groomed
fresh
only
slightly
heated
horses
exchanging
remarks
and
smiling
had
stopped
behind
the
emperor
the
emperor
francis
a
rosy
long
faced
young
man
sat
very
erect
on
his
handsome
black
horse
looking
about
him
in
a
leisurely
and
preoccupied
manner
he
beckoned
to
one
of
his
white
adjutants
and
asked
some
question
most
likely
he
is
asking
at
what
o
clock
they
started
thought
prince
andrew
watching
his
old
acquaintance
with
a
smile
he
could
not
repress
as
he
recalled
his
reception
at
brunn
in
the
emperors
suite
were
the
picked
young
orderly
officers
of
the
guard
and
line
regiments
russian
and
austrian
among
them
were
grooms
leading
the
tsar
s
beautiful
relay
horses
covered
with
embroidered
cloths
as
when
a
window
is
opened
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
from
the
fields
enters
a
stuffy
room
so
a
whiff
of
youthfulness
energy
and
confidence
of
success
reached
kutuzov
s
cheerless
staff
with
the
galloping
advent
of
all
these
brilliant
young
men
why
aren
t
you
beginning
michael
ilarionovich
said
the
emperor
alexander
hurriedly
to
kutuzov
glancing
courteously
at
the
same
time
at
the
emperor
francis
i
am
waiting
your
majesty
answered
kutuzov
bending
forward
respectfully
the
emperor
frowning
slightly
bent
his
ear
forward
as
if
he
had
not
quite
heard
waiting
your
majesty
repeated
kutuzov
prince
andrew
noted
that
kutuzov
s
upper
lip
twitched
unnaturally
as
he
said
the
word
waiting
not
all
the
columns
have
formed
up
yet
your
majesty
the
tsar
heard
but
obviously
did
not
like
the
reply
he
shrugged
his
rather
round
shoulders
and
glanced
at
novosiltsev
who
was
near
him
as
if
complaining
of
kutuzov
you
know
michael
ilarionovich
we
are
not
on
the
empress
field
where
a
parade
does
not
begin
till
all
the
troops
are
assembled
said
the
tsar
with
another
glance
at
the
emperor
francis
as
if
inviting
him
if
not
to
join
in
at
least
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
but
the
emperor
francis
continued
to
look
about
him
and
did
not
listen
that
is
just
why
i
do
not
begin
sire
said
kutuzov
in
a
resounding
voice
apparently
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
not
being
heard
and
again
something
in
his
face
twitched
that
is
just
why
i
do
not
begin
sire
because
we
are
not
on
parade
and
not
on
the
empress
field
said
he
clearly
and
distinctly
in
the
emperor
s
suite
all
exchanged
rapid
looks
that
expressed
dissatisfaction
and
reproach
old
though
he
may
be
he
should
not
he
certainly
should
not
speak
like
that
their
glances
seemed
to
say
the
tsar
looked
intently
and
observantly
into
kutuzov
s
eye
waiting
to
hear
whether
he
would
say
anything
more
but
kutuzov
with
respectfully
bowed
head
seemed
also
to
be
waiting
the
silence
lasted
for
about
a
minute
however
if
you
command
it
your
majesty
said
kutuzov
lifting
his
head
and
again
assuming
his
former
tone
of
a
dull
unreasoning
but
submissive
general
he
touched
his
horse
and
having
called
miloradovich
the
commander
of
the
column
gave
him
the
order
to
advance
the
troops
again
began
to
move
and
two
battalions
of
the
novgorod
and
one
of
the
apsheron
regiment
went
forward
past
the
emperor
as
this
apsheron
battalion
marched
by
the
red
faced
miloradovich
without
his
greatcoat
with
his
orders
on
his
breast
and
an
enormous
tuft
of
plumes
in
his
cocked
hat
worn
on
one
side
with
its
corners
front
and
back
galloped
strenuously
forward
and
with
a
dashing
salute
reined
in
his
horse
before
the
emperor
god
be
with
you
general
said
the
emperor
ma
foi
sire
nous
ferons
ce
qui
sera
dans
notre
possibilite
sire
he
answered
gaily
raising
nevertheless
ironic
smiles
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
tsar
s
suite
by
his
poor
french
indeed
sire
we
shall
do
everything
it
is
possible
to
do
sire
miloradovich
wheeled
his
horse
sharply
and
stationed
himself
a
little
behind
the
emperor
the
apsheron
men
excited
by
the
tsar
s
presence
passed
in
step
before
the
emperors
and
their
suites
at
a
bold
brisk
pace
lads
shouted
miloradovich
in
a
loud
self
confident
and
cheery
voice
obviously
so
elated
by
the
sound
of
firing
by
the
prospect
of
battle
and
by
the
sight
of
the
gallant
apsherons
his
comrades
in
suvorov
s
time
now
passing
so
gallantly
before
the
emperors
that
he
forgot
the
sovereigns
presence
lads
it
s
not
the
first
village
you
ve
had
to
take
cried
he
glad
to
do
our
best
shouted
the
soldiers
the
emperor
s
horse
started
at
the
sudden
cry
this
horse
that
had
carried
the
sovereign
at
reviews
in
russia
bore
him
also
here
on
the
field
of
austerlitz
enduring
the
heedless
blows
of
his
left
foot
and
pricking
its
ears
at
the
sound
of
shots
just
as
it
had
done
on
the
empress
field
not
understanding
the
significance
of
the
firing
nor
of
the
nearness
of
the
emperor
francis
black
cob
nor
of
all
that
was
being
said
thought
and
felt
that
day
by
its
rider
the
emperor
turned
with
a
smile
to
one
of
his
followers
and
made
a
remark
to
him
pointing
to
the
gallant
apsherons
chapter
xvi
kutuzov
accompanied
by
his
adjutants
rode
at
a
walking
pace
behind
the
carabineers
when
he
had
gone
less
than
half
a
mile
in
the
rear
of
the
column
he
stopped
at
a
solitary
deserted
house
that
had
probably
once
been
an
inn
where
two
roads
parted
both
of
them
led
downhill
and
troops
were
marching
along
both
the
fog
had
begun
to
clear
and
enemy
troops
were
already
dimly
visible
about
a
mile
and
a
half
off
on
the
opposite
heights
down
below
on
the
left
the
firing
became
more
distinct
kutuzov
had
stopped
and
was
speaking
to
an
austrian
general
prince
andrew
who
was
a
little
behind
looking
at
them
turned
to
an
adjutant
to
ask
him
for
a
field
glass
look
look
said
this
adjutant
looking
not
at
the
troops
in
the
distance
but
down
the
hill
before
him
it
s
the
french
the
two
generals
and
the
adjutant
took
hold
of
the
field
glass
trying
to
snatch
it
from
one
another
the
expression
on
all
their
faces
suddenly
changed
to
one
of
horror
the
french
were
supposed
to
be
a
mile
and
a
half
away
but
had
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
appeared
just
in
front
of
us
it
s
the
enemy
no
yes
see
it
is
for
certain
but
how
is
that
said
different
voices
with
the
naked
eye
prince
andrew
saw
below
them
to
the
right
not
more
than
five
hundred
paces
from
where
kutuzov
was
standing
a
dense
french
column
coming
up
to
meet
the
apsherons
here
it
is
the
decisive
moment
has
arrived
my
turn
has
come
thought
prince
andrew
and
striking
his
horse
he
rode
up
to
kutuzov
the
apsherons
must
be
stopped
your
excellency
cried
he
but
at
that
very
instant
a
cloud
of
smoke
spread
all
round
firing
was
heard
quite
close
at
hand
and
a
voice
of
naive
terror
barely
two
steps
from
prince
andrew
shouted
brothers
all
s
lost
and
at
this
as
if
at
a
command
everyone
began
to
run
confused
and
ever
increasing
crowds
were
running
back
to
where
five
minutes
before
the
troops
had
passed
the
emperors
not
only
would
it
have
been
difficult
to
stop
that
crowd
it
was
even
impossible
not
to
be
carried
back
with
it
oneself
bolkonski
only
tried
not
to
lose
touch
with
it
and
looked
around
bewildered
and
unable
to
grasp
what
was
happening
in
front
of
him
nesvitski
with
an
angry
face
red
and
unlike
himself
was
shouting
to
kutuzov
that
if
he
did
not
ride
away
at
once
he
would
certainly
be
taken
prisoner
kutuzov
remained
in
the
same
place
and
without
answering
drew
out
a
handkerchief
blood
was
flowing
from
his
cheek
prince
andrew
forced
his
way
to
him
you
are
wounded
he
asked
hardly
able
to
master
the
trembling
of
his
lower
jaw
the
wound
is
not
here
it
is
there
said
kutuzov
pressing
the
handkerchief
to
his
wounded
cheek
and
pointing
to
the
fleeing
soldiers
stop
them
he
shouted
and
at
the
same
moment
probably
realizing
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
them
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
right
a
fresh
wave
of
the
flying
mob
caught
him
and
bore
him
back
with
it
the
troops
were
running
in
such
a
dense
mass
that
once
surrounded
by
them
it
was
difficult
to
get
out
again
one
was
shouting
get
on
why
are
you
hindering
us
another
in
the
same
place
turned
round
and
fired
in
the
air
a
third
was
striking
the
horse
kutuzov
himself
rode
having
by
a
great
effort
got
away
to
the
left
from
that
flood
of
men
kutuzov
with
his
suite
diminished
by
more
than
half
rode
toward
a
sound
of
artillery
fire
near
by
having
forced
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
of
fugitives
prince
andrew
trying
to
keep
near
kutuzov
saw
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
amid
the
smoke
a
russian
battery
that
was
still
firing
and
frenchmen
running
toward
it
higher
up
stood
some
russian
infantry
neither
moving
forward
to
protect
the
battery
nor
backward
with
the
fleeing
crowd
a
mounted
general
separated
himself
from
the
infantry
and
approached
kutuzov
of
kutuzov
s
suite
only
four
remained
they
were
all
pale
and
exchanged
looks
in
silence
stop
those
wretches
gasped
kutuzov
to
the
regimental
commander
pointing
to
the
flying
soldiers
but
at
that
instant
as
if
to
punish
him
for
those
words
bullets
flew
hissing
across
the
regiment
and
across
kutuzov
s
suite
like
a
flock
of
little
birds
the
french
had
attacked
the
battery
and
seeing
kutuzov
were
firing
at
him
after
this
volley
the
regimental
commander
clutched
at
his
leg
several
soldiers
fell
and
a
second
lieutenant
who
was
holding
the
flag
let
it
fall
from
his
hands
it
swayed
and
fell
but
caught
on
the
muskets
of
the
nearest
soldiers
the
soldiers
started
firing
without
orders
oh
oh
oh
groaned
kutuzov
despairingly
and
looked
around
bolkonski
he
whispered
his
voice
trembling
from
a
consciousness
of
the
feebleness
of
age
bolkonski
he
whispered
pointing
to
the
disordered
battalion
and
at
the
enemy
what
s
that
but
before
he
had
finished
speaking
prince
andrew
feeling
tears
of
shame
and
anger
choking
him
had
already
leapt
from
his
horse
and
run
to
the
standard
forward
lads
he
shouted
in
a
voice
piercing
as
a
child
s
here
it
is
thought
he
seizing
the
staff
of
the
standard
and
hearing
with
pleasure
the
whistle
of
bullets
evidently
aimed
at
him
several
soldiers
fell
hurrah
shouted
prince
andrew
and
scarcely
able
to
hold
up
the
heavy
standard
he
ran
forward
with
full
confidence
that
the
whole
battalion
would
follow
him
and
really
he
only
ran
a
few
steps
alone
one
soldier
moved
and
then
another
and
soon
the
whole
battalion
ran
forward
shouting
hurrah
and
overtook
him
a
sergeant
of
the
battalion
ran
up
and
took
the
flag
that
was
swaying
from
its
weight
in
prince
andrew
s
hands
but
he
was
immediately
killed
prince
andrew
again
seized
the
standard
and
dragging
it
by
the
staff
ran
on
with
the
battalion
in
front
he
saw
our
artillerymen
some
of
whom
were
fighting
while
others
having
abandoned
their
guns
were
running
toward
him
he
also
saw
french
infantry
soldiers
who
were
seizing
the
artillery
horses
and
turning
the
guns
round
prince
andrew
and
the
battalion
were
already
within
twenty
paces
of
the
cannon
he
heard
the
whistle
of
bullets
above
him
unceasingly
and
to
right
and
left
of
him
soldiers
continually
groaned
and
dropped
but
he
did
not
look
at
them
he
looked
only
at
what
was
going
on
in
front
of
him
at
the
battery
he
now
saw
clearly
the
figure
of
a
red
haired
gunner
with
his
shako
knocked
awry
pulling
one
end
of
a
mop
while
a
french
soldier
tugged
at
the
other
he
could
distinctly
see
the
distraught
yet
angry
expression
on
the
faces
of
these
two
men
who
evidently
did
not
realize
what
they
were
doing
what
are
they
about
thought
prince
andrew
as
he
gazed
at
them
why
doesn
t
the
red
haired
gunner
run
away
as
he
is
unarmed
why
doesn
t
the
frenchman
stab
him
he
will
not
get
away
before
the
frenchman
remembers
his
bayonet
and
stabs
him
and
really
another
french
soldier
trailing
his
musket
ran
up
to
the
struggling
men
and
the
fate
of
the
red
haired
gunner
who
had
triumphantly
secured
the
mop
and
still
did
not
realize
what
awaited
him
was
about
to
be
decided
but
prince
andrew
did
not
see
how
it
ended
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
one
of
the
soldiers
near
him
hit
him
on
the
head
with
the
full
swing
of
a
bludgeon
it
hurt
a
little
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
pain
distracted
him
and
prevented
his
seeing
what
he
had
been
looking
at
what
s
this
am
i
falling
my
legs
are
giving
way
thought
he
and
fell
on
his
back
he
opened
his
eyes
hoping
to
see
how
the
struggle
of
the
frenchmen
with
the
gunners
ended
whether
the
red
haired
gunner
had
been
killed
or
not
and
whether
the
cannon
had
been
captured
or
saved
but
he
saw
nothing
above
him
there
was
now
nothing
but
the
sky
the
lofty
sky
not
clear
yet
still
immeasurably
lofty
with
gray
clouds
gliding
slowly
across
it
how
quiet
peaceful
and
solemn
not
at
all
as
i
ran
thought
prince
andrew
not
as
we
ran
shouting
and
fighting
not
at
all
as
the
gunner
and
the
frenchman
with
frightened
and
angry
faces
struggled
for
the
mop
how
differently
do
those
clouds
glide
across
that
lofty
infinite
sky
how
was
it
i
did
not
see
that
lofty
sky
before
and
how
happy
i
am
to
have
found
it
at
last
yes
all
is
vanity
all
falsehood
except
that
infinite
sky
there
is
nothing
nothing
but
that
but
even
it
does
not
exist
there
is
nothing
but
quiet
and
peace

by
bagration
at
nine
o
clock
the
battle
had
not
yet
begun
not
wishing
to
agree
to
dolgorukov
s
demand
to
commence
the
action
and
wishing
to
avert
responsibility
from
himself
prince
bagration
proposed
to
dolgorukov
to
send
to
inquire
of
the
commander
in
chief
bagration
knew
that
as
the
distance
between
the
two
flanks
was
more
than
six
miles
even
if
the
messenger
were
not
killed
which
he
very
likely
would
be
and
found
the
commander
in
chief
which
would
be
very
difficult
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
back
before
evening
bagration
cast
his
large
expressionless
sleepy
eyes
round
his
suite
and
the
boyish
face
rostov
breathless
with
excitement
and
hope
was
the
first
to
catch
his
eye
he
sent
him
and
if
i
should
meet
his
majesty
before
i
meet
the
commander
in
chief
your
excellency
said
rostov
with
his
hand
to
his
cap
you
can
give
the
message
to
his
majesty
said
dolgorukov
hurriedly
interrupting
bagration
on
being
relieved
from
picket
duty
rostov
had
managed
to
get
a
few
hours
sleep
before
morning
and
felt
cheerful
bold
and
resolute
with
elasticity
of
movement
faith
in
his
good
fortune
and
generally
in
that
state
of
mind
which
makes
everything
seem
possible
pleasant
and
easy
all
his
wishes
were
being
fulfilled
that
morning
there
was
to
be
a
general
engagement
in
which
he
was
taking
part
more
than
that
he
was
orderly
to
the
bravest
general
and
still
more
he
was
going
with
a
message
to
kutuzov
perhaps
even
to
the
sovereign
himself
the
morning
was
bright
he
had
a
good
horse
under
him
and
his
heart
was
full
of
joy
and
happiness
on
receiving
the
order
he
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
galloped
along
the
line
at
first
he
rode
along
the
line
of
bagration
s
troops
which
had
not
yet
advanced
into
action
but
were
standing
motionless
then
he
came
to
the
region
occupied
by
uvarov
s
cavalry
and
here
he
noticed
a
stir
and
signs
of
preparation
for
battle
having
passed
uvarov
s
cavalry
he
clearly
heard
the
sound
of
cannon
and
musketry
ahead
of
him
the
firing
grew
louder
and
louder
in
the
fresh
morning
air
were
now
heard
not
two
or
three
musket
shots
at
irregular
intervals
as
before
followed
by
one
or
two
cannon
shots
but
a
roll
of
volleys
of
musketry
from
the
slopes
of
the
hill
before
pratzen
interrupted
by
such
frequent
reports
of
cannon
that
sometimes
several
of
them
were
not
separated
from
one
another
but
merged
into
a
general
roar
he
could
see
puffs
of
musketry
smoke
that
seemed
to
chase
one
another
down
the
hillsides
and
clouds
of
cannon
smoke
rolling
spreading
and
mingling
with
one
another
he
could
also
by
the
gleam
of
bayonets
visible
through
the
smoke
make
out
moving
masses
of
infantry
and
narrow
lines
of
artillery
with
green
caissons
rostov
stopped
his
horse
for
a
moment
on
a
hillock
to
see
what
was
going
on
but
strain
his
attention
as
he
would
he
could
not
understand
or
make
out
anything
of
what
was
happening
there
in
the
smoke
men
of
some
sort
were
moving
about
in
front
and
behind
moved
lines
of
troops
but
why
whither
and
who
they
were
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
these
sights
and
sounds
had
no
depressing
or
intimidating
effect
on
him
on
the
contrary
they
stimulated
his
energy
and
determination
go
on
go
on
give
it
them
he
mentally
exclaimed
at
these
sounds
and
again
proceeded
to
gallop
along
the
line
penetrating
farther
and
farther
into
the
region
where
the
army
was
already
in
action
how
it
will
be
there
i
don
t
know
but
all
will
be
well
thought
rostov
after
passing
some
austrian
troops
he
noticed
that
the
next
part
of
the
line
the
guards
was
already
in
action
so
much
the
better
i
shall
see
it
close
he
thought
he
was
riding
almost
along
the
front
line
a
handful
of
men
came
galloping
toward
him
they
were
our
uhlans
who
with
disordered
ranks
were
returning
from
the
attack
rostov
got
out
of
their
way
involuntarily
noticed
that
one
of
them
was
bleeding
and
galloped
on
that
is
no
business
of
mine
he
thought
he
had
not
ridden
many
hundred
yards
after
that
before
he
saw
to
his
left
across
the
whole
width
of
the
field
an
enormous
mass
of
cavalry
in
brilliant
white
uniforms
mounted
on
black
horses
trotting
straight
toward
him
and
across
his
path
rostov
put
his
horse
to
full
gallop
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
these
men
and
he
would
have
got
clear
had
they
continued
at
the
same
speed
but
they
kept
increasing
their
pace
so
that
some
of
the
horses
were
already
galloping
rostov
heard
the
thud
of
their
hoofs
and
the
jingle
of
their
weapons
and
saw
their
horses
their
figures
and
even
their
faces
more
and
more
distinctly
they
were
our
horse
guards
advancing
to
attack
the
french
cavalry
that
was
coming
to
meet
them
the
horse
guards
were
galloping
but
still
holding
in
their
horses
rostov
could
already
see
their
faces
and
heard
the
command
charge
shouted
by
an
officer
who
was
urging
his
thoroughbred
to
full
speed
rostov
fearing
to
be
crushed
or
swept
into
the
attack
on
the
french
galloped
along
the
front
as
hard
as
his
horse
could
go
but
still
was
not
in
time
to
avoid
them
the
last
of
the
horse
guards
a
huge
pockmarked
fellow
frowned
angrily
on
seeing
rostov
before
him
with
whom
he
would
inevitably
collide
this
guardsman
would
certainly
have
bowled
rostov
and
his
bedouin
over
rostov
felt
himself
quite
tiny
and
weak
compared
to
these
gigantic
men
and
horses
had
it
not
occurred
to
rostov
to
flourish
his
whip
before
the
eyes
of
the
guardsman
s
horse
the
heavy
black
horse
sixteen
hands
high
shied
throwing
back
its
ears
but
the
pockmarked
guardsman
drove
his
huge
spurs
in
violently
and
the
horse
flourishing
its
tail
and
extending
its
neck
galloped
on
yet
faster
hardly
had
the
horse
guards
passed
rostov
before
he
heard
them
shout
hurrah
and
looking
back
saw
that
their
foremost
ranks
were
mixed
up
with
some
foreign
cavalry
with
red
epaulets
probably
french
he
could
see
nothing
more
for
immediately
afterwards
cannon
began
firing
from
somewhere
and
smoke
enveloped
everything
at
that
moment
as
the
horse
guards
having
passed
him
disappeared
in
the
smoke
rostov
hesitated
whether
to
gallop
after
them
or
to
go
where
he
was
sent
this
was
the
brilliant
charge
of
the
horse
guards
that
amazed
the
french
themselves
rostov
was
horrified
to
hear
later
that
of
all
that
mass
of
huge
and
handsome
men
of
all
those
brilliant
rich
youths
officers
and
cadets
who
had
galloped
past
him
on
their
thousand
ruble
horses
only
eighteen
were
left
after
the
charge
why
should
i
envy
them
my
chance
is
not
lost
and
maybe
i
shall
see
the
emperor
immediately
thought
rostov
and
galloped
on
when
he
came
level
with
the
foot
guards
he
noticed
that
about
them
and
around
them
cannon
balls
were
flying
of
which
he
was
aware
not
so
much
because
he
heard
their
sound
as
because
he
saw
uneasiness
on
the
soldiers
faces
and
unnatural
warlike
solemnity
on
those
of
the
officers
passing
behind
one
of
the
lines
of
a
regiment
of
foot
guards
he
heard
a
voice
calling
him
by
name
rostov
what
he
answered
not
recognizing
boris
i
say
we
ve
been
in
the
front
line
our
regiment
attacked
said
boris
with
the
happy
smile
seen
on
the
faces
of
young
men
who
have
been
under
fire
for
the
first
time
rostov
stopped
have
you
he
said
well
how
did
it
go
we
drove
them
back
said
boris
with
animation
growing
talkative
can
you
imagine
it
and
he
began
describing
how
the
guards
having
taken
up
their
position
and
seeing
troops
before
them
thought
they
were
austrians
and
all
at
once
discovered
from
the
cannon
balls
discharged
by
those
troops
that
they
were
themselves
in
the
front
line
and
had
unexpectedly
to
go
into
action
rostov
without
hearing
boris
to
the
end
spurred
his
horse
where
are
you
off
to
asked
boris
with
a
message
to
his
majesty
there
he
is
said
boris
thinking
rostov
had
said
his
highness
and
pointing
to
the
grand
duke
who
with
his
high
shoulders
and
frowning
brows
stood
a
hundred
paces
away
from
them
in
his
helmet
and
horse
guards
jacket
shouting
something
to
a
pale
white
uniformed
austrian
officer
but
that
s
the
grand
duke
and
i
want
the
commander
in
chief
or
the
emperor
said
rostov
and
was
about
to
spur
his
horse
count
count
shouted
berg
who
ran
up
from
the
other
side
as
eager
as
boris
count
i
am
wounded
in
my
right
hand
and
he
showed
his
bleeding
hand
with
a
handkerchief
tied
round
it
and
i
remained
at
the
front
i
held
my
sword
in
my
left
hand
count
all
our
family
the
von
bergs
have
been
knights
he
said
something
more
but
rostov
did
not
wait
to
hear
it
and
rode
away
having
passed
the
guards
and
traversed
an
empty
space
rostov
to
avoid
again
getting
in
front
of
the
first
line
as
he
had
done
when
the
horse
guards
charged
followed
the
line
of
reserves
going
far
round
the
place
where
the
hottest
musket
fire
and
cannonade
were
heard
suddenly
he
heard
musket
fire
quite
close
in
front
of
him
and
behind
our
troops
where
he
could
never
have
expected
the
enemy
to
be
what
can
it
be
he
thought
the
enemy
in
the
rear
of
our
army
impossible
and
suddenly
he
was
seized
by
a
panic
of
fear
for
himself
and
for
the
issue
of
the
whole
battle
but
be
that
what
it
may
he
reflected
there
is
no
riding
round
it
now
i
must
look
for
the
commander
in
chief
here
and
if
all
is
lost
it
is
for
me
to
perish
with
the
rest
the
foreboding
of
evil
that
had
suddenly
come
over
rostov
was
more
and
more
confirmed
the
farther
he
rode
into
the
region
behind
the
village
of
pratzen
which
was
full
of
troops
of
all
kinds
what
does
it
mean
what
is
it
whom
are
they
firing
at
who
is
firing
rostov
kept
asking
as
he
came
up
to
russian
and
austrian
soldiers
running
in
confused
crowds
across
his
path
the
devil
knows
they
ve
killed
everybody
it
s
all
up
now
he
was
told
in
russian
german
and
czech
by
the
crowd
of
fugitives
who
understood
what
was
happening
as
little
as
he
did
kill
the
germans
shouted
one
may
the
devil
take
them
the
traitors
zum
henker
diese
russen
muttered
a
german
hang
these
russians
several
wounded
men
passed
along
the
road
and
words
of
abuse
screams
and
groans
mingled
in
a
general
hubbub
then
the
firing
died
down
rostov
learned
later
that
russian
and
austrian
soldiers
had
been
firing
at
one
another
my
god
what
does
it
all
mean
thought
he
and
here
where
at
any
moment
the
emperor
may
see
them
but
no
these
must
be
only
a
handful
of
scoundrels
it
will
soon
be
over
it
can
t
be
that
it
can
t
be
only
to
get
past
them
quicker
quicker
the
idea
of
defeat
and
flight
could
not
enter
rostov
s
head
though
he
saw
french
cannon
and
french
troops
on
the
pratzen
heights
just
where
he
had
been
ordered
to
look
for
the
commander
in
chief
he
could
not
did
not
wish
to
believe
that
chapter
xviii
rostov
had
been
ordered
to
look
for
kutuzov
and
the
emperor
near
the
village
of
pratzen
but
neither
they
nor
a
single
commanding
officer
were
there
only
disorganized
crowds
of
troops
of
various
kinds
he
urged
on
his
already
weary
horse
to
get
quickly
past
these
crowds
but
the
farther
he
went
the
more
disorganized
they
were
the
highroad
on
which
he
had
come
out
was
thronged
with
caleches
carriages
of
all
sorts
and
russian
and
austrian
soldiers
of
all
arms
some
wounded
and
some
not
this
whole
mass
droned
and
jostled
in
confusion
under
the
dismal
influence
of
cannon
balls
flying
from
the
french
batteries
stationed
on
the
pratzen
heights
where
is
the
emperor
where
is
kutuzov
rostov
kept
asking
everyone
he
could
stop
but
got
no
answer
from
anyone
at
last
seizing
a
soldier
by
his
collar
he
forced
him
to
answer
eh
brother
they
ve
all
bolted
long
ago
said
the
soldier
laughing
for
some
reason
and
shaking
himself
free
having
left
that
soldier
who
was
evidently
drunk
rostov
stopped
the
horse
of
a
batman
or
groom
of
some
important
personage
and
began
to
question
him
the
man
announced
that
the
tsar
had
been
driven
in
a
carriage
at
full
speed
about
an
hour
before
along
that
very
road
and
that
he
was
dangerously
wounded
it
can
t
be
said
rostov
it
must
have
been
someone
else
i
saw
him
myself
replied
the
man
with
a
self
confident
smile
of
derision
i
ought
to
know
the
emperor
by
now
after
the
times
i
ve
seen
him
in
petersburg
i
saw
him
just
as
i
see
you
there
he
sat
in
the
carriage
as
pale
as
anything
how
they
made
the
four
black
horses
fly
gracious
me
they
did
rattle
past
it
s
time
i
knew
the
imperial
horses
and
ilya
ivanych
i
don
t
think
ilya
drives
anyone
except
the
tsar
rostov
let
go
of
the
horse
and
was
about
to
ride
on
when
a
wounded
officer
passing
by
addressed
him
who
is
it
you
want
he
asked
the
commander
in
chief
he
was
killed
by
a
cannon
ball
struck
in
the
breast
before
our
regiment
not
killed
wounded
another
officer
corrected
him
who
kutuzov
asked
rostov
not
kutuzov
but
what
s
his
name
well
never
mind
there
are
not
many
left
alive
go
that
way
to
that
village
all
the
commanders
are
there
said
the
officer
pointing
to
the
village
of
hosjeradek
and
he
walked
on
rostov
rode
on
at
a
footpace
not
knowing
why
or
to
whom
he
was
now
going
the
emperor
was
wounded
the
battle
lost
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
it
now
rostov
rode
in
the
direction
pointed
out
to
him
in
which
he
saw
turrets
and
a
church
what
need
to
hurry
what
was
he
now
to
say
to
the
tsar
or
to
kutuzov
even
if
they
were
alive
and
unwounded
take
this
road
your
honor
that
way
you
will
be
killed
at
once
a
soldier
shouted
to
him
they
d
kill
you
there
oh
what
are
you
talking
about
said
another
where
is
he
to
go
that
way
is
nearer
rostov
considered
and
then
went
in
the
direction
where
they
said
he
would
be
killed
it
s
all
the
same
now
if
the
emperor
is
wounded
am
i
to
try
to
save
myself
he
thought
he
rode
on
to
the
region
where
the
greatest
number
of
men
had
perished
in
fleeing
from
pratzen
the
french
had
not
yet
occupied
that
region
and
the
russians
the
uninjured
and
slightly
wounded
had
left
it
long
ago
all
about
the
field
like
heaps
of
manure
on
well
kept
plowland
lay
from
ten
to
fifteen
dead
and
wounded
to
each
couple
of
acres
the
wounded
crept
together
in
twos
and
threes
and
one
could
hear
their
distressing
screams
and
groans
sometimes
feigned
or
so
it
seemed
to
rostov
he
put
his
horse
to
a
trot
to
avoid
seeing
all
these
suffering
men
and
he
felt
afraid
afraid
not
for
his
life
but
for
the
courage
he
needed
and
which
he
knew
would
not
stand
the
sight
of
these
unfortunates
the
french
who
had
ceased
firing
at
this
field
strewn
with
dead
and
wounded
where
there
was
no
one
left
to
fire
at
on
seeing
an
adjutant
riding
over
it
trained
a
gun
on
him
and
fired
several
shots
the
sensation
of
those
terrible
whistling
sounds
and
of
the
corpses
around
him
merged
in
rostov
s
mind
into
a
single
feeling
of
terror
and
pity
for
himself
he
remembered
his
mother
s
last
letter
what
would
she
feel
thought
he
if
she
saw
me
here
now
on
this
field
with
the
cannon
aimed
at
me
in
the
village
of
hosjeradek
there
were
russian
troops
retiring
from
the
field
of
battle
who
though
still
in
some
confusion
were
less
disordered
the
french
cannon
did
not
reach
there
and
the
musketry
fire
sounded
far
away
here
everyone
clearly
saw
and
said
that
the
battle
was
lost
no
one
whom
rostov
asked
could
tell
him
where
the
emperor
or
kutuzov
was
some
said
the
report
that
the
emperor
was
wounded
was
correct
others
that
it
was
not
and
explained
the
false
rumor
that
had
spread
by
the
fact
that
the
emperor
s
carriage
had
really
galloped
from
the
field
of
battle
with
the
pale
and
terrified
ober
hofmarschal
count
tolstoy
who
had
ridden
out
to
the
battlefield
with
others
in
the
emperor
s
suite
one
officer
told
rostov
that
he
had
seen
someone
from
headquarters
behind
the
village
to
the
left
and
thither
rostov
rode
not
hoping
to
find
anyone
but
merely
to
ease
his
conscience
when
he
had
ridden
about
two
miles
and
had
passed
the
last
of
the
russian
troops
he
saw
near
a
kitchen
garden
with
a
ditch
round
it
two
men
on
horseback
facing
the
ditch
one
with
a
white
plume
in
his
hat
seemed
familiar
to
rostov
the
other
on
a
beautiful
chestnut
horse
which
rostov
fancied
he
had
seen
before
rode
up
to
the
ditch
struck
his
horse
with
his
spurs
and
giving
it
the
rein
leaped
lightly
over
only
a
little
earth
crumbled
from
the
bank
under
the
horse
s
hind
hoofs
turning
the
horse
sharply
he
again
jumped
the
ditch
and
deferentially
addressed
the
horseman
with
the
white
plumes
evidently
suggesting
that
he
should
do
the
same
the
rider
whose
figure
seemed
familiar
to
rostov
and
involuntarily
riveted
his
attention
made
a
gesture
of
refusal
with
his
head
and
hand
and
by
that
gesture
rostov
instantly
recognized
his
lamented
and
adored
monarch
but
it
can
t
be
he
alone
in
the
midst
of
this
empty
field
thought
rostov
at
that
moment
alexander
turned
his
head
and
rostov
saw
the
beloved
features
that
were
so
deeply
engraved
on
his
memory
the
emperor
was
pale
his
cheeks
sunken
and
his
eyes
hollow
but
the
charm
the
mildness
of
his
features
was
all
the
greater
rostov
was
happy
in
the
assurance
that
the
rumors
about
the
emperor
being
wounded
were
false
he
was
happy
to
be
seeing
him
he
knew
that
he
might
and
even
ought
to
go
straight
to
him
and
give
the
message
dolgorukov
had
ordered
him
to
deliver
but
as
a
youth
in
love
trembles
is
unnerved
and
dares
not
utter
the
thoughts
he
has
dreamed
of
for
nights
but
looks
around
for
help
or
a
chance
of
delay
and
flight
when
the
longed
for
moment
comes
and
he
is
alone
with
her
so
rostov
now
that
he
had
attained
what
he
had
longed
for
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
did
not
know
how
to
approach
the
emperor
and
a
thousand
reasons
occurred
to
him
why
it
would
be
inconvenient
unseemly
and
impossible
to
do
so
what
it
is
as
if
i
were
glad
of
a
chance
to
take
advantage
of
his
being
alone
and
despondent
a
strange
face
may
seem
unpleasant
or
painful
to
him
at
this
moment
of
sorrow
besides
what
can
i
say
to
him
now
when
my
heart
fails
me
and
my
mouth
feels
dry
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
not
one
of
the
innumerable
speeches
addressed
to
the
emperor
that
he
had
composed
in
his
imagination
could
he
now
recall
those
speeches
were
intended
for
quite
other
conditions
they
were
for
the
most
part
to
be
spoken
at
a
moment
of
victory
and
triumph
generally
when
he
was
dying
of
wounds
and
the
sovereign
had
thanked
him
for
heroic
deeds
and
while
dying
he
expressed
the
love
his
actions
had
proved
besides
how
can
i
ask
the
emperor
for
his
instructions
for
the
right
flank
now
that
it
is
nearly
four
o
clock
and
the
battle
is
lost
no
certainly
i
must
not
approach
him
i
must
not
intrude
on
his
reflections
better
die
a
thousand
times
than
risk
receiving
an
unkind
look
or
bad
opinion
from
him
rostov
decided
and
sorrowfully
and
with
a
heart
full
despair
he
rode
away
continually
looking
back
at
the
tsar
who
still
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
indecision
while
rostov
was
thus
arguing
with
himself
and
riding
sadly
away
captain
von
toll
chanced
to
ride
to
the
same
spot
and
seeing
the
emperor
at
once
rode
up
to
him
offered
his
services
and
assisted
him
to
cross
the
ditch
on
foot
the
emperor
wishing
to
rest
and
feeling
unwell
sat
down
under
an
apple
tree
and
von
toll
remained
beside
him
rostov
from
a
distance
saw
with
envy
and
remorse
how
von
toll
spoke
long
and
warmly
to
the
emperor
and
how
the
emperor
evidently
weeping
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
pressed
von
toll
s
hand
and
i
might
have
been
in
his
place
thought
rostov
and
hardly
restraining
his
tears
of
pity
for
the
emperor
he
rode
on
in
utter
despair
not
knowing
where
to
or
why
he
was
now
riding
his
despair
was
all
the
greater
from
feeling
that
his
own
weakness
was
the
cause
of
his
grief
he
might
not
only
might
but
should
have
gone
up
to
the
sovereign
it
was
a
unique
chance
to
show
his
devotion
to
the
emperor
and
he
had
not
made
use
of
it
what
have
i
done
thought
he
and
he
turned
round
and
galloped
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
emperor
but
there
was
no
one
beyond
the
ditch
now
only
some
carts
and
carriages
were
passing
by
from
one
of
the
drivers
he
learned
that
kutuzov
s
staff
were
not
far
off
in
the
village
the
vehicles
were
going
to
rostov
followed
them
in
front
of
him
walked
kutuzov
s
groom
leading
horses
in
horsecloths
then
came
a
cart
and
behind
that
walked
an
old
bandy
legged
domestic
serf
in
a
peaked
cap
and
sheepskin
coat
tit
i
say
tit
said
the
groom
what
answered
the
old
man
absent
mindedly
go
tit
thresh
a
bit
oh
you
fool
said
the
old
man
spitting
angrily
some
time
passed
in
silence
and
then
the
same
joke
was
repeated
before
five
in
the
evening
the
battle
had
been
lost
at
all
points
more
than
a
hundred
cannon
were
already
in
the
hands
of
the
french
przebyszewski
and
his
corps
had
laid
down
their
arms
other
columns
after
losing
half
their
men
were
retreating
in
disorderly
confused
masses
the
remains
of
langeron
s
and
dokhturov
s
mingled
forces
were
crowding
around
the
dams
and
banks
of
the
ponds
near
the
village
of
augesd
after
five
o
clock
it
was
only
at
the
augesd
dam
that
a
hot
cannonade
delivered
by
the
french
alone
was
still
to
be
heard
from
numerous
batteries
ranged
on
the
slopes
of
the
pratzen
heights
directed
at
our
retreating
forces
in
the
rearguard
dokhturov
and
others
rallying
some
battalions
kept
up
a
musketry
fire
at
the
french
cavalry
that
was
pursuing
our
troops
it
was
growing
dusk
on
the
narrow
augesd
dam
where
for
so
many
years
the
old
miller
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
in
his
tasseled
cap
peacefully
angling
while
his
grandson
with
shirt
sleeves
rolled
up
handled
the
floundering
silvery
fish
in
the
watering
can
on
that
dam
over
which
for
so
many
years
moravians
in
shaggy
caps
and
blue
jackets
had
peacefully
driven
their
two
horse
carts
loaded
with
wheat
and
had
returned
dusty
with
flour
whitening
their
carts
on
that
narrow
dam
amid
the
wagons
and
the
cannon
under
the
horses
hoofs
and
between
the
wagon
wheels
men
disfigured
by
fear
of
death
now
crowded
together
crushing
one
another
dying
stepping
over
the
dying
and
killing
one
another
only
to
move
on
a
few
steps
and
be
killed
themselves
in
the
same
way
every
ten
seconds
a
cannon
ball
flew
compressing
the
air
around
or
a
shell
burst
in
the
midst
of
that
dense
throng
killing
some
and
splashing
with
blood
those
near
them
dolokhov
now
an
officer
wounded
in
the
arm
and
on
foot
with
the
regimental
commander
on
horseback
and
some
ten
men
of
his
company
represented
all
that
was
left
of
that
whole
regiment
impelled
by
the
crowd
they
had
got
wedged
in
at
the
approach
to
the
dam
and
jammed
in
on
all
sides
had
stopped
because
a
horse
in
front
had
fallen
under
a
cannon
and
the
crowd
were
dragging
it
out
a
cannon
ball
killed
someone
behind
them
another
fell
in
front
and
splashed
dolokhov
with
blood
the
crowd
pushing
forward
desperately
squeezed
together
moved
a
few
steps
and
again
stopped
move
on
a
hundred
yards
and
we
are
certainly
saved
remain
here
another
two
minutes
and
it
is
certain
death
thought
each
one
dolokhov
who
was
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
forced
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
dam
throwing
two
soldiers
off
their
feet
and
ran
onto
the
slippery
ice
that
covered
the
millpool

way
he
shouted
jumping
over
the
ice
which
creaked
under
him
turn
this
way
he
shouted
to
those
with
the
gun
it
bears
the
ice
bore
him
but
it
swayed
and
creaked
and
it
was
plain
that
it
would
give
way
not
only
under
a
cannon
or
a
crowd
but
very
soon
even
under
his
weight
alone
the
men
looked
at
him
and
pressed
to
the
bank
hesitating
to
step
onto
the
ice
the
general
on
horseback
at
the
entrance
to
the
dam
raised
his
hand
and
opened
his
mouth
to
address
dolokhov
suddenly
a
cannon
ball
hissed
so
low
above
the
crowd
that
everyone
ducked
it
flopped
into
something
moist
and
the
general
fell
from
his
horse
in
a
pool
of
blood
nobody
gave
him
a
look
or
thought
of
raising
him

onto

the
ice

don
t
you
hear
go
on
innumerable
voices
suddenly
shouted
after
the
ball
had
struck
the
general
the
men
themselves
not
knowing
what
or
why
they
were
shouting
one
of
the
hindmost
guns
that
was
going
onto
the
dam
turned
off
onto
the
ice
crowds
of
soldiers
from
the
dam
began
running
onto
the
frozen
pond
the
ice
gave
way
under
one
of
the
foremost
soldiers
and
one
leg
slipped
into
the
water
he
tried
to
right
himself
but
fell
in
up
to
his
waist
the
nearest
soldiers
shrank
back
the
gun
driver
stopped
his
horse
but
from
behind
still
came
the
shouts
onto
the
ice
why
do
you
stop
go
on
go
on
and
cries
of
horror
were
heard
in
the
crowd
the
soldiers
near
the
gun
waved
their
arms
and
beat
the
horses
to
make
them
turn
and
move
on
the
horses
moved
off
the
bank
the
ice
that
had
held
under
those
on

collapsed
in
a
great
mass
and
some
forty
men
who
were
on
it
dashed
some
forward
and
some
back
drowning
one
another
still
the
cannon
balls
continued
regularly
to
whistle
and
flop
onto
the
ice

chapter
xix
on
the
pratzen
heights
where
he
had
fallen
with
the
flagstaff
in
his
hand
lay
prince
andrew
bolkonski
bleeding
profusely
and
unconsciously
uttering
a
gentle
piteous
and
childlike
moan
toward
evening
he
ceased
moaning
and
became
quite
still
he
did
not
know
how
long
his
unconsciousness
lasted
suddenly
he
again
felt
that
he
was
alive
and
suffering
from
a
burning
lacerating
pain
in
his
head
where
is
it
that
lofty
sky
that
i
did
not
know
till
now
but
saw
today
was
his
first
thought
and
i
did
not
know
this
suffering
either
he
thought
yes
i
did
not
know
anything
anything
at
all
till
now
but
where
am
i
he
listened
and
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
horses
and
voices
speaking
french
he
opened
his
eyes
above
him
again
was
the
same
lofty
sky
with
clouds
that
had
risen
and
were
floating
still
higher
and
between
them
gleamed
blue
infinity
he
did
not
turn
his
head
and
did
not
see
those
who
judging
by
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
voices
had
ridden
up
and
stopped
near
him
it
was
napoleon
accompanied
by
two
aides
de
camp
bonaparte
riding
over
the
battlefield
had
given
final
orders
to
strengthen
the
batteries
firing
at
the
augesd
dam
and
was
looking
at
the
killed
and
wounded
left
on
the
field
fine
men
remarked
napoleon
looking
at
a
dead
russian
grenadier
who
with
his
face
buried
in
the
ground
and
a
blackened
nape
lay
on
his
stomach
with
an
already
stiffened
arm
flung
wide
the
ammunition
for
the
guns
in
position
is
exhausted
your
majesty
said
an
adjutant
who
had
come
from
the
batteries
that
were
firing
at
augesd
have
some
brought
from
the
reserve
said
napoleon
and
having
gone
on
a
few
steps
he
stopped
before
prince
andrew
who
lay
on
his
back
with
the
flagstaff
that
had
been
dropped
beside
him
the
flag
had
already
been
taken
by
the
french
as
a
trophy
that
s
a
fine
death
said
napoleon
as
he
gazed
at
bolkonski
prince
andrew
understood
that
this
was
said
of
him
and
that
it
was
napoleon
who
said
it
he
heard
the
speaker
addressed
as
sire
but
he
heard
the
words
as
he
might
have
heard
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
not
only
did
they
not
interest
him
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
and
at
once
forgot
them
his
head
was
burning
he
felt
himself
bleeding
to
death
and
he
saw
above
him
the
remote
lofty
and
everlasting
sky
he
knew
it
was
napoleon
his
hero
but
at
that
moment
napoleon
seemed
to
him
such
a
small
insignificant
creature
compared
with
what
was
passing
now
between
himself
and
that
lofty
infinite
sky
with
the
clouds
flying
over
it
at
that
moment
it
meant
nothing
to
him
who
might
be
standing
over
him
or
what
was
said
of
him
he
was
only
glad
that
people
were
standing
near
him
and
only
wished
that
they
would
help
him
and
bring
him
back
to
life
which
seemed
to
him
so
beautiful
now
that
he
had
today
learned
to
understand
it
so
differently
he
collected
all
his
strength
to
stir
and
utter
a
sound
he
feebly
moved
his
leg
and
uttered
a
weak
sickly
groan
which
aroused
his
own
pity
ah
he
is
alive
said
napoleon
lift
this
young
man
up
and
carry
him
to
the
dressing
station
having
said
this
napoleon
rode
on
to
meet
marshal
lannes
who
hat
in
hand
rode
up
smiling
to
the
emperor
to
congratulate
him
on
the
victory
prince
andrew
remembered
nothing
more
he
lost
consciousness
from
the
terrible
pain
of
being
lifted
onto
the
stretcher
the
jolting
while
being
moved
and
the
probing
of
his
wound
at
the
dressing
station
he
did
not
regain
consciousness
till
late
in
the
day
when
with
other
wounded
and
captured
russian
officers
he
was
carried
to
the
hospital
during
this
transfer
he
felt
a
little
stronger
and
was
able
to
look
about
him
and
even
speak
the
first
words
he
heard
on
coming
to
his
senses
were
those
of
a
french
convoy
officer
who
said
rapidly
we
must
halt
here
the
emperor
will
pass
here
immediately
it
will
please
him
to
see
these
gentlemen
prisoners
there
are
so
many
prisoners
today
nearly
the
whole
russian
army
that
he
is
probably
tired
of
them

the
same

say
this
one
is
the

of

which
is
the
senior
he
asked
on
seeing
the
prisoners
they
named
the
colonel
prince
repnin
you
are
the
commander
of
the
emperor
alexander
s
regiment
of
horse
guards
asked
napoleon
i
commanded
a
squadron
replied
repnin
your
regiment
fulfilled
its
duty
honorably
said
napoleon
the
praise
of
a
great
commander
is
a
soldier
s
highest
reward
said
repnin
i
bestow
it
with
pleasure
said
napoleon
and
who
is
that
young
man
beside
you
prince
repnin
named
lieutenant
sukhtelen
after
looking
at
him
napoleon
smiled
he
s
very
young
to
come
to
meddle
with
us
youth
is
no
hindrance
to
courage
muttered
sukhtelen
in
a
failing
voice
a
splendid
reply
said
napoleon
young
man
you
will
go
far
prince
andrew
who
had
also
been
brought
forward
before
the
emperor
s
eyes
to
complete
the
show
of
prisoners
could
not
fail
to
attract
his
attention
napoleon
apparently
remembered
seeing
him
on
the
battlefield
and
addressing
him
again
used
the
epithet
young
man
that
was
connected
in
his
memory
with
prince
andrew
well
and
you
young
man
said
he
how
do
you
feel
mon
brave
though
five
minutes
before
prince
andrew
had
been
able
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
soldiers
who
were
carrying
him
now
with
his
eyes
fixed
straight
on
napoleon
he
was
silent
so
insignificant
at
that
moment
seemed
to
him
all
the
interests
that
engrossed
napoleon
so
mean
did
his
hero
himself
with
his
paltry
vanity
and
joy
in
victory
appear
compared
to
the
lofty
equitable
and
kindly
sky
which
he
had
seen
and
understood
that
he
could
not
answer
him
everything
seemed
so
futile
and
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
stern
and
solemn
train
of
thought
that
weakness
from
loss
of
blood
suffering
and
the
nearness
of
death
aroused
in
him
looking
into
napoleon
s
eyes
prince
andrew
thought
of
the
insignificance
of
greatness
the
unimportance
of
life
which
no
one
could
understand
and
the
still
greater
unimportance
of
death
the
meaning
of
which
no
one
alive
could
understand
or
explain
the
emperor
without
waiting
for
an
answer
turned
away
and
said
to
one
of
the
officers
as
he
went
have
these
gentlemen
attended
to
and
taken
to
my
bivouac
let
my
doctor
larrey
examine
their
wounds
au
revoir
prince
repnin
and
he
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
away
his
face
shone
with
self
satisfaction
and
pleasure
the
soldiers
who
had
carried
prince
andrew
had
noticed
and
taken
the
little
gold
icon
princess
mary
had
hung
round
her
brother
s
neck
but
seeing
the
favor
the
emperor
showed
the
prisoners
they
now
hastened
to
return
the
holy
image
prince
andrew
did
not
see
how
and
by
whom
it
was
replaced
but
the
little
icon
with
its
thin
gold
chain
suddenly
appeared
upon
his
chest
outside
his
uniform
it
would
be
good
thought
prince
andrew
glancing
at
the
icon
his
sister
had
hung
round
his
neck
with
such
emotion
and
reverence
it
would
be
good
if
everything
were
as
clear
and
simple
as
it
seems
to
mary
how
good
it
would
be
to
know
where
to
seek
for
help
in
this
life
and
what
to
expect
after
it
beyond
the
grave
how
happy
and
calm
i
should
be
if
i
could
now
say
lord
have
mercy
on
me
but
to
whom
should
i
say
that
either
to
a
power
indefinable
incomprehensible
which
i
not
only
cannot
address
but
which
i
cannot
even
express
in
words
the
great
all
or
nothing
said
he
to
himself
or
to
that
god
who
has
been
sewn
into
this
amulet
by
mary
there
is
nothing
certain
nothing
at
all
except
the
unimportance
of
everything
i
understand
and
the
greatness
of
something
incomprehensible
but
all
important
the
stretchers
moved
on
at
every
jolt
he
again
felt
unendurable
pain
his
feverishness
increased
and
he
grew
delirious
visions
of
his
father
wife
sister
and
future
son
and
the
tenderness
he
had
felt
the
night
before
the
battle
the
figure
of
the
insignificant
little
napoleon
and
above
all
this
the
lofty
sky
formed
the
chief
subjects
of
his
delirious
fancies
the
quiet
home
life
and
peaceful
happiness
of
bald
hills
presented
itself
to
him
he
was
already
enjoying
that
happiness
when
that
little
napoleon
had
suddenly
appeared
with
his
unsympathizing
look
of
shortsighted
delight
at
the
misery
of
others
and
doubts
and
torments
had
followed
and
only
the
heavens
promised
peace
toward
morning
all
these
dreams
melted
and
merged
into
the
chaos
and
darkness
of
unconciousness
and
oblivion
which
in
the
opinion
of
napoleon
s
doctor
larrey
was
much
more
likely
to
end
in
death
than
in
convalescence
he
is
a
nervous
bilious
subject
said
larrey
and
will
not
recover
and
prince
andrew
with
others
fatally
wounded
was
left
to
the
care
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
book
four
chapter
i
early
in
the
year
nicholas
rostov
returned
home
on
leave
denisov
was
going
home
to
voronezh
and
rostov
persuaded
him
to
travel
with
him
as
far
as
moscow
and
to
stay
with
him
there
meeting
a
comrade
at
the
last
post
station
but
one
before
moscow
denisov
had
drunk
three
bottles
of
wine
with
him
and
despite
the
jolting
ruts
across
the
snow
covered
road
did
not
once
wake
up
on
the
way
to
moscow
but
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
sleigh
beside
rostov
who
grew
more
and
more
impatient
the
nearer
they
got
to
moscow
how
much
longer
how
much
longer
oh
these
insufferable
streets
shops
bakers
signboards
street
lamps
and
sleighs
thought
rostov
when
their
leave
permits
had
been
passed
at
the
town
gate
and
they
had
entered
moscow
denisov
we
re
here
he
s
asleep
he
added
leaning
forward
with
his
whole
body
as
if
in
that
position
he
hoped
to
hasten
the
speed
of
the
sleigh
denisov
gave
no
answer
there
s
the
corner
at
the
crossroads
where
the
cabman
zakhar
has
his
stand
and
there
s
zakhar
himself
and
still
the
same
horse
and
here
s
the
little
shop
where
we
used
to
buy
gingerbread
can
t
you
hurry
up
now
then
which
house
is
it
asked
the
driver
why
that
one
right
at
the
end
the
big
one
don
t
you
see
that
s
our
house
said
rostov
of
course
it
s
our
house
denisov
denisov
we
re
almost
there
denisov
raised
his
head
coughed
and
made
no
answer
dmitri
said
rostov
to
his
valet
on
the
box
those
lights
are
in
our
house
aren
t
they
yes
sir
and
there
s
a
light
in
your
father
s
study
then
they
ve
not
gone
to
bed
yet
what
do
you
think
mind
now
don
t
forget
to
put
out
my
new
coat
added
rostov
fingering
his
new
mustache
now
then
get
on
he
shouted
to
the
driver
do
wake
up
vaska
he
went
on
turning
to
denisov
whose
head
was
again
nodding
come
get
on
you
shall
have
three
rubles
for
vodka
get
on
rostov
shouted
when
the
sleigh
was
only
three
houses
from
his
door
it
seemed
to
him
the
horses
were
not
moving
at
all
at
last
the
sleigh
bore
to
the
right
drew
up
at
an
entrance
and
rostov
saw
overhead
the
old
familiar
cornice
with
a
bit
of
plaster
broken
off
the
porch
and
the
post
by
the
side
of
the
pavement
he
sprang
out
before
the
sleigh
stopped
and
ran
into
the
hall
the
house
stood
cold
and
silent
as
if
quite
regardless
of
who
had
come
to
it
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
oh
god
is
everyone
all
right
he
thought
stopping
for
a
moment
with
a
sinking
heart
and
then
immediately
starting
to
run
along
the
hall
and
up
the
warped
steps
of
the
familiar
staircase
the
well
known
old
door
handle
which
always
angered
the
countess
when
it
was
not
properly
cleaned
turned
as
loosely
as
ever
a
solitary
tallow
candle
burned
in
the
anteroom
old
michael
was
asleep
on
the
chest
prokofy
the
footman
who
was
so
strong
that
he
could
lift
the
back
of
the
carriage
from
behind
sat
plaiting
slippers
out
of
cloth
selvedges
he
looked
up
at
the
opening
door
and
his
expression
of
sleepy
indifference
suddenly
changed
to
one
of
delighted
amazement
gracious
heavens
the
young
count
he
cried
recognizing
his
young
master
can
it
be
my
treasure
and
prokofy
trembling
with
excitement
rushed
toward
the
drawing
room
door
probably
in
order
to
announce
him
but
changing
his
mind
came
back
and
stooped
to
kiss
the
young
man
s
shoulder
all
well
asked
rostov
drawing
away
his
arm
yes
god
be
thanked
yes
they
ve
just
finished
supper
let
me
have
a
look
at
you
your
excellency
is
everything
quite
all
right
the
lord
be
thanked
yes
rostov
who
had
completely
forgotten
denisov
not
wishing
anyone
to
forestall
him
threw
off
his
fur
coat
and
ran
on
tiptoe
through
the
large
dark
ballroom
all
was
the
same
there
were
the
same
old
card
tables
and
the
same
chandelier
with
a
cover
over
it
but
someone
had
already
seen
the
young
master
and
before
he
had
reached
the
drawing
room
something
flew
out
from
a
side
door
like
a
tornado
and
began
hugging
and
kissing
him
another
and
yet
another
creature
of
the
same
kind
sprang
from
a
second
door
and
a
third
more
hugging
more
kissing
more
outcries
and
tears
of
joy
he
could
not
distinguish
which
was
papa
which
natasha
and
which
petya
everyone
shouted
talked
and
kissed
him
at
the
same
time
only
his
mother
was
not
there
he
noticed
that
and
i
did
not
know
nicholas
my
darling
here
he
is
our
own
kolya
dear
fellow
how
he
has
changed
where
are
the
candles
tea
nicholas
and
me
kiss
me
dearest
and
me
sonya
natasha
petya
anna
mikhaylovna
vera
and
the
old
count
were
all
hugging
him
and
the
serfs
men
and
maids
flocked
into
the
room
exclaiming
and
oh
ing
and
ah
ing
petya
clinging
to
his
legs
kept
shouting
and
me
too
natasha
after
she
had
pulled
him
down
toward
her
and
covered
his
face
with
kisses
holding
him
tight
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat
sprang
away
and
pranced
up
and
down
in
one
place
like
a
goat
and
shrieked
piercingly
all
around
were
loving
eyes
glistening
with
tears
of
joy
and
all
around
were
lips
seeking
a
kiss
sonya
too
all
rosy
red
clung
to
his
arm
and
radiant
with
bliss
looked
eagerly
toward
his
eyes
waiting
for
the
look
for
which
she
longed
sonya
now
was
sixteen
and
she
was
very
pretty
especially
at
this
moment
of
happy
rapturous
excitement
she
gazed
at
him
not
taking
her
eyes
off
him
and
smiling
and
holding
her
breath
he
gave
her
a
grateful
look
but
was
still
expectant
and
looking
for
someone
the
old
countess
had
not
yet
come
but
now
steps
were
heard
at
the
door
steps
so
rapid
that
they
could
hardly
be
his
mother
s
yet
it
was
she
dressed
in
a
new
gown
which
he
did
not
know
made
since
he
had
left
all
the
others
let
him
go
and
he
ran
to
her
when
they
met
she
fell
on
his
breast
sobbing
she
could
not
lift
her
face
but
only
pressed
it
to
the
cold
braiding
of
his
hussar
s
jacket
denisov
who
had
come
into
the
room
unnoticed
by
anyone
stood
there
and
wiped
his
eyes
at
the
sight
vasili
denisov
your
son
s
friend
he
said
introducing
himself
to
the
count
who
was
looking
inquiringly
at
him
you
are
most
welcome
i
know
i
know
said
the
count
kissing
and
embracing
denisov
nicholas
wrote
us
natasha
vera
look
here
is
denisov
the
same
happy
rapturous
faces
turned
to
the
shaggy
figure
of
denisov
darling
denisov
screamed
natasha
beside
herself
with
rapture
springing
to
him
putting
her
arms
round
him
and
kissing
him
this
escapade
made
everybody
feel
confused
denisov
blushed
too
but
smiled
and
taking
natasha
s
hand
kissed
it
denisov
was
shown
to
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
the
rostovs
all
gathered
round
nicholas
in
the
sitting
room
the
old
countess
not
letting
go
of
his
hand
and
kissing
it
every
moment
sat
beside
him
the
rest
crowding
round
him
watched
every
movement
word
or
look
of
his
never
taking
their
blissfully
adoring
eyes
off
him
his
brother
and
sisters
struggled
for
the
places
nearest
to
him
and
disputed
with
one
another
who
should
bring
him
his
tea
handkerchief
and
pipe
rostov
was
very
happy
in
the
love
they
showed
him
but
the
first
moment
of
meeting
had
been
so
beatific
that
his
present
joy
seemed
insufficient
and
he
kept
expecting
something
more
more
and
yet
more
next
morning
after
the
fatigues
of
their
journey
the
travelers
slept
till
ten
o
clock
in
the
room
next
their
bedroom
there
was
a
confusion
of
sabers
satchels
sabretaches
open
portmanteaus
and
dirty
boots
two
freshly
cleaned
pairs
with
spurs
had
just
been
placed
by
the
wall
the
servants
were
bringing
in
jugs
and
basins
hot
water
for
shaving
and
their
well
brushed
clothes
there
was
a
masculine
odor
and
a
smell
of
tobacco
hallo
gwiska
my
pipe
came
vasili
denisov
s
husky
voice
wostov
get
up
rostov
rubbing
his
eyes
that
seemed
glued
together
raised
his
disheveled
head
from
the
hot
pillow
why
is
it
late
late
it
s
nearly
ten
o
clock
answered
natasha
s
voice
a
rustle
of
starched
petticoats
and
the
whispering
and
laughter
of
girls
voices
came
from
the
adjoining
room
the
door
was
opened
a
crack
and
there
was
a
glimpse
of
something
blue
of
ribbons
black
hair
and
merry
faces
it
was
natasha
sonya
and
petya
who
had
come
to
see
whether
they
were
getting
up
nicholas
get
up
natasha
s
voice
was
again
heard
at
the
door
directly
meanwhile
petya
having
found
and
seized
the
sabers
in
the
outer
room
with
the
delight
boys
feel
at
the
sight
of
a
military
elder
brother
and
forgetting
that
it
was
unbecoming
for
the
girls
to
see
men
undressed
opened
the
bedroom
door
is
this
your
saber
he
shouted
the
girls
sprang
aside
denisov
hid
his
hairy
legs
under
the
blanket
looking
with
a
scared
face
at
his
comrade
for
help
the
door
having
let
petya
in
closed
again
a
sound
of
laughter
came
from
behind
it
nicholas
come
out
in
your
dressing
gown
said
natasha
s
voice
is
this
your
saber
asked
petya
or
is
it
yours
he
said
addressing
the
black
mustached
denisov
with
servile
deference
rostov
hurriedly
put
something
on
his
feet
drew
on
his
dressing
gown
and
went
out
natasha
had
put
on
one
spurred
boot
and
was
just
getting
her
foot
into
the
other
sonya
when
he
came
in
was
twirling
round
and
was
about
to
expand
her
dresses
into
a
balloon
and
sit
down
they
were
dressed
alike
in
new
pale
blue
frocks
and
were
both
fresh
rosy
and
bright
sonya
ran
away
but
natasha
taking
her
brother
s
arm
led
him
into
the
sitting
room
where
they
began
talking
they
hardly
gave
one
another
time
to
ask
questions
and
give
replies
concerning
a
thousand
little
matters
which
could
not
interest
anyone
but
themselves
natasha
laughed
at
every
word
he
said
or
that
she
said
herself
not
because
what
they
were
saying
was
amusing
but
because
she
felt
happy
and
was
unable
to
control
her
joy
which
expressed
itself
by
laughter
oh
how
nice
how
splendid
she
said
to
everything
rostov
felt
that
under
the
influence
of
the
warm
rays
of
love
that
childlike
smile
which
had
not
once
appeared
on
his
face
since
he
left
home
now
for
the
first
time
after
eighteen
months
again
brightened
his
soul
and
his
face
no
but
listen
she
said
now
you
are
quite
a
man
aren
t
you
i
m
awfully
glad
you
re
my
brother
she
touched
his
mustache

want
to
know

run
away
asked
rostov
ah
yes
that
s
a
whole
long
story
how
are
you
going
to
speak
to
her
thou
or
you
as
may
happen
said
rostov
no
call
her
you
please
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
some
other
time
no
i
ll
tell
you
now
you
know
sonya
s
my
dearest
friend
such
a
friend
that
i
burned
my
arm
for
her
sake
look
here
she
pulled
up
her
muslin
sleeve
and
showed
him
a
red
scar
on
her
long
slender
delicate
arm
high
above
the
elbow
on
that
part
that
is
covered
even
by
a
ball
dress
i
burned
this
to
prove
my
love
for
her
i
just
heated
a
ruler
in
the
fire
and
pressed
it
there
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
the
little
cushions
on
its
arms
in
what
used
to
be
his
old
schoolroom
and
looking
into
natasha
s
wildly
bright
eyes
rostov
re
entered
that
world
of
home
and
childhood
which
had
no
meaning
for
anyone
else
but
gave
him
some
of
the
best
joys
of
his
life
and
the
burning
of
an
arm
with
a
ruler
as
a
proof
of
love
did
not
seem
to
him
senseless
he
understood
and
was
not
surprised
at
it
well
and
is
that
all
he
asked
we
are
such
friends
such
friends
all
that
ruler
business
was
just
nonsense
but
we
are
friends
forever
she
if
she
loves
anyone
does
it
for
life
but
i
don
t
understand
that
i
forget
quickly
well
what
then
well
she
loves
me
and
you
like
that
natasha
suddenly
flushed
why
you
remember
before
you
went
away
well
she
says
you
are
to
forget
all
that
she
says
i
shall
love
him
always
but
let
him
be
free
isn
t
that
lovely
and
noble
yes
very
noble
isn
t
it
asked
natasha
so
seriously
and
excitedly
that
it
was
evident
that
what
she
was
now
saying
she
had
talked
of
before
with
tears
rostov
became
thoughtful
i
never
go
back
on
my
word
he
said
besides
sonya
is
so
charming
that
only
a
fool
would
renounce
such
happiness
no
no
cried
natasha
she
and
i
have
already
talked
it
over
we
knew
you
d
say
so
but
it
won
t
do
because
you
see
if
you
say
that
if
you
consider
yourself
bound
by
your
promise
it
will
seem
as
if
she
had
not
meant
it
seriously
it
makes
it
as
if
you
were
marrying
her
because
you
must
and
that
wouldn
t
do
at
all
rostov
saw
that
it
had
been
well
considered
by
them
sonya
had
already
struck
him
by
her
beauty
on
the
preceding
day
today
when
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
she
seemed
still
more
lovely
she
was
a
charming
girl
of
sixteen
evidently
passionately
in
love
with
him
he
did
not
doubt
that
for
an
instant
why
should
he
not
love
her
now
and
even
marry
her
rostov
thought
but
just
now
there
were
so
many
other
pleasures
and
interests
before
him
yes
they
have
taken
a
wise
decision
he
thought
i
must
remain
free
well
then
that
s
excellent
said
he
we
ll
talk
it
over
later
on
oh
how
glad
i
am
to
have
you
well
and
are
you
still
true
to
boris
he
continued
oh
what
nonsense
cried
natasha
laughing
i
don
t
think
about
him
or
anyone
else
and
i
don
t
want
anything
of
the
kind
dear
me
then
what
are
you
up
to
now
now
repeated
natasha
and
a
happy
smile
lit
up
her
face
have
you
seen
duport
no
not
seen
duport
the
famous
dancer
well
then
you
won
t
understand
that
s
what
i
m
up
to
curving
her
arms
natasha
held
out
her
skirts
as
dancers
do
ran
back
a
few
steps
turned
cut
a
caper
brought
her
little
feet
sharply
together
and
made
some
steps
on
the
very
tips
of
her
toes
see
i
m
standing
see
she
said
but
could
not
maintain
herself
on
her
toes
any
longer
so
that
s
what
i
m
up
to
i
ll
never
marry
anyone
but
will
be
a
dancer
only
don
t
tell
anyone
rostov
laughed
so
loud
and
merrily
that
denisov
in
his
bedroom
felt
envious
and
natasha
could
not
help
joining
in
no
but
don
t
you
think
it
s
nice
she
kept
repeating
nice
and
so
you
no
longer
wish
to
marry
boris
natasha
flared
up
i
don
t
want
to
marry
anyone
and
i
ll
tell
him
so
when
i
see
him
dear
me
said
rostov
but
that
s
all
rubbish
natasha
chattered
on
and
is
denisov
nice
she
asked
yes
indeed
oh
well
then
good
by
go
and
dress
is
he
very
terrible
denisov
why
terrible
asked
nicholas
no
vaska
is
a
splendid
fellow
you
call
him
vaska
that
s
funny
and
is
he
very
nice
very
well
then
be
quick
we
ll
all
have
breakfast
together
and
natasha
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
on
tiptoe
like
a
ballet
dancer
but
smiling
as
only
happy
girls
of
fifteen
can
smile
when
rostov
met
sonya
in
the
drawing
room
he
reddened
he
did
not
know
how
to
behave
with
her
the
evening
before
in
the
first
happy
moment
of
meeting
they
had
kissed
each
other
but
today
they
felt
it
could
not
be
done
he
felt
that
everybody
including
his
mother
and
sisters
was
looking
inquiringly
at
him
and
watching
to
see
how
he
would
behave
with
her
he
kissed
her
hand
and
addressed
her
not
as
thou
but
as
you
sonya
but
their
eyes
met
and
said
thou
and
exchanged
tender
kisses
her
looks
asked
him
to
forgive
her
for
having
dared
by
natasha
s
intermediacy
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
and
then
thanked
him
for
his
love
his
looks
thanked
her
for
offering
him
his
freedom
and
told
her
that
one
way
or
another
he
would
never
cease
to
love
her
for
that
would
be
impossible
how
strange
it
is
said
vera
selecting
a
moment
when
all
were
silent
that
sonya
and
nicholas
now
say
you
to
one
another
and
meet
like
strangers
vera
s
remark
was
correct
as
her
remarks
always
were
but
like
most
of
her
observations
it
made
everyone
feel
uncomfortable
not
only
sonya
nicholas
and
natasha
but
even
the
old
countess
who
dreading
this
love
affair
which
might
hinder
nicholas
from
making
a
brilliant
match
blushed
like
a
girl
denisov
to
rostov
s
surprise
appeared
in
the
drawing
room
with
pomaded
hair
perfumed
and
in
a
new
uniform
looking
just
as
smart
as
he
made
himself
when
going
into
battle
and
he
was
more
amiable
to
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
than
rostov
had
ever
expected
to
see
him
chapter
ii
on
his
return
to
moscow
from
the
army
nicholas
rostov
was
welcomed
by
his
home
circle
as
the
best
of
sons
a
hero
and
their
darling
nikolenka
by
his
relations
as
a
charming
attractive
and
polite
young
man
by
his
acquaintances
as
a
handsome
lieutenant
of
hussars
a
good
dancer
and
one
of
the
best
matches
in
the
city
the
rostovs
knew
everybody
in
moscow
the
old
count
had
money
enough
that
year
as
all
his
estates
had
been
remortgaged
and
so
nicholas
acquiring
a
trotter
of
his
own
very
stylish
riding
breeches
of
the
latest
cut
such
as
no
one
else
yet
had
in
moscow
and
boots
of
the
latest
fashion
with
extremely
pointed
toes
and
small
silver
spurs
passed
his
time
very
gaily
after
a
short
period
of
adapting
himself
to
the
old
conditions
of
life
nicholas
found
it
very
pleasant
to
be
at
home
again
he
felt
that
he
had
grown
up
and
matured
very
much
his
despair
at
failing
in
a
scripture
examination
his
borrowing
money
from
gavril
to
pay
a
sleigh
driver
his
kissing
sonya
on
the
sly
he
now
recalled
all
this
as
childishness
he
had
left
immeasurably
behind
now
he
was
a
lieutenant
of
hussars
in
a
jacket
laced
with
silver
and
wearing
the
cross
of
st
george
awarded
to
soldiers
for
bravery
in
action
and
in
the
company
of
well
known
elderly
and
respected
racing
men
was
training
a
trotter
of
his
own
for
a
race
he
knew
a
lady
on
one
of
the
boulevards
whom
he
visited
of
an
evening
he
led
the
mazurka
at
the
arkharovs
ball
talked
about
the
war
with
field
marshal
kamenski
visited
the
english
club
and
was
on
intimate
terms
with
a
colonel
of
forty
to
whom
denisov
had
introduced
him
his
passion
for
the
emperor
had
cooled
somewhat
in
moscow
but
still
as
he
did
not
see
him
and
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
him
he
often
spoke
about
him
and
about
his
love
for
him
letting
it
be
understood
that
he
had
not
told
all
and
that
there
was
something
in
his
feelings
for
the
emperor
not
everyone
could
understand
and
with
his
whole
soul
he
shared
the
adoration
then
common
in
moscow
for
the
emperor
who
was
spoken
of
as
the
angel
incarnate
during
rostov
s
short
stay
in
moscow
before
rejoining
the
army
he
did
not
draw
closer
to
sonya
but
rather
drifted
away
from
her
she
was
very
pretty
and
sweet
and
evidently
deeply
in
love
with
him
but
he
was
at
the
period
of
youth
when
there
seems
so
much
to
do
that
there
is
no
time
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
a
young
man
fears
to
bind
himself
and
prizes
his
freedom
which
he
needs
for
so
many
other
things
when
he
thought
of
sonya
during
this
stay
in
moscow
he
said
to
himself
ah
there
will
be
and
there
are
many
more
such
girls
somewhere
whom
i
do
not
yet
know
there
will
be
time
enough
to
think
about
love
when
i
want
to
but
now
i
have
no
time
besides
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
society
of
women
was
rather
derogatory
to
his
manhood
he
went
to
balls
and
into
ladies
society
with
an
affectation
of
doing
so
against
his
will
the
races
the
english
club
sprees
with
denisov
and
visits
to
a
certain
house
that
was
another
matter
and
quite
the
thing
for
a
dashing
young
hussar
at
the
beginning
of
march
old
count
ilya
rostov
was
very
busy
arranging
a
dinner
in
honor
of
prince
bagration
at
the
english
club
the
count
walked
up
and
down
the
hall
in
his
dressing
gown
giving
orders
to
the
club
steward
and
to
the
famous
feoktist
the
club
s
head
cook
about
asparagus
fresh
cucumbers
strawberries
veal
and
fish
for
this
dinner
the
count
had
been
a
member
and
on
the
committee
of
the
club
from
the
day
it
was
founded
to
him
the
club
entrusted
the
arrangement
of
the
festival
in
honor
of
bagration
for
few
men
knew
so
well
how
to
arrange
a
feast
on
an
open
handed
hospitable
scale
and
still
fewer
men
would
be
so
well
able
and
willing
to
make
up
out
of
their
own
resources
what
might
be
needed
for
the
success
of
the
fete
the
club
cook
and
the
steward
listened
to
the
count
s
orders
with
pleased
faces
for
they
knew
that
under
no
other
management
could
they
so
easily
extract
a
good
profit
for
themselves
from
a
dinner
costing
several
thousand
rubles
well
then
mind
and
have
cocks
comb
in
the
turtle
soup
you
know
shall
we
have
three
cold
dishes
then
asked
the
cook
the
count
considered
we
can
t
have
less
yes
three
the
mayonnaise
that
s
one
said
he
bending
down
a
finger
then
am
i
to
order
those
large
sterlets
asked
the
steward
yes
it
can
t
be
helped
if
they
won
t
take
less
ah
dear
me
i
was
forgetting
we
must
have
another
entree
ah
goodness
gracious
he
clutched
at
his
head
who
is
going
to
get
me
the
flowers
dmitri
eh
dmitri
gallop
off
to
our
moscow
estate
he
said
to
the
factotum
who
appeared
at
his
call
hurry
off
and
tell
maksim
the
gardener
to
set
the
serfs
to
work
say
that
everything
out
of
the
hothouses
must
be
brought
here
well
wrapped
up
in
felt
i
must
have
two
hundred
pots
here
on
friday
having
given
several
more
orders
he
was
about
to
go
to
his
little
countess
to
have
a
rest
but
remembering
something
else
of
importance
he
returned
again
called
back
the
cook
and
the
club
steward
and
again
began
giving
orders
a
light
footstep
and
the
clinking
of
spurs
were
heard
at
the
door
and
the
young
count
handsome
rosy
with
a
dark
little
mustache
evidently
rested
and
made
sleeker
by
his
easy
life
in
moscow
entered
the
room
ah
my
boy
my
head
s
in
a
whirl
said
the
old
man
with
a
smile
as
if
he
felt
a
little
confused
before
his
son
now
if
you
would
only
help
a
bit
i
must
have
singers
too
i
shall
have
my
own
orchestra
but
shouldn
t
we
get
the
gypsy
singers
as
well
you
military
men
like
that
sort
of
thing
really
papa
i
believe
prince
bagration
worried
himself
less
before
the
battle
of
schon
grabern
than
you
do
now
said
his
son
with
a
smile
the
old
count
pretended
to
be
angry
yes
you
talk
but
try
it
yourself
and
the
count
turned
to
the
cook
who
with
a
shrewd
and
respectful
expression
looked
observantly
and
sympathetically
at
the
father
and
son
what
have
the
young
people
come
to
nowadays
eh
feoktist
said
he
laughing
at
us
old
fellows
that
s
so
your
excellency
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
eat
a
good
dinner
but
providing
it
and
serving
it
all
up
that
s
not
their
business
that
s
it
that
s
it
exclaimed
the
count
and
gaily
seizing
his
son
by
both
hands
he
cried
now
i
ve
got
you
so
take
the
sleigh
and
pair
at
once
and
go
to
bezukhov
s
and
tell
him

not

himself
so

and
ask

princesses
and
from
there
go
on
to
the
rasgulyay

coachman

and
look
up
the
gypsy
ilyushka
the
one
who
danced
at
count

in
a
white
cossack
coat
and
bring
him
along
to
me
and
am
i
to
bring
the
gypsy
girls
along
with
him
asked
nicholas
laughing
dear
dear
at
that
moment
with
noiseless
footsteps
and
with
the
businesslike
preoccupied
yet
meekly
christian
look
which
never
left
her
face
anna
mikhaylovna
entered
the
hall
though
she
came
upon
the
count
in
his
dressing
gown
every
day
he
invariably
became
confused
and
begged
her
to
excuse
his
costume
no
matter
at
all
my
dear
count
she
said
meekly
closing
her
eyes
but
i
ll
go
to
bezukhov
s
myself
pierre
has
arrived
and
now
we
shall
get
anything
we
want
from
his
hothouses

have
to
see
him
in
any
case
he
has
forwarded
me
a
letter
from
boris
thank
god
boris
is
now
on
the
staff
the
count
was
delighted
at
anna
mikhaylovna
s
taking
upon
herself
one
of
his
commissions
and
ordered
the
small
closed
carriage
for
her
tell
bezukhov
to
come
i
ll
put
his
name
down
is
his
wife
with
him
he
asked
anna
mikhaylovna
turned
up
her
eyes
and
profound
sadness
was
depicted
on
her
face
ah
my
dear
friend
he
is
very
unfortunate
she
said
if
what
we
hear
is
true
it
is
dreadful
how
little
we
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
when
we
were
rejoicing
at
his
happiness
and
such
a
lofty
angelic
soul
as
young
bezukhov
yes
i
pity
him
from
my
heart
and
shall
try
to
give
him
what
consolation
i
can
wh
what
is
the
matter
asked
both
the
young
and
old
rostov
anna
mikhaylovna
sighed
deeply
dolokhov
mary
ivanovna
s
son
she
said
in
a
mysterious
whisper
has
compromised
her
completely
they
say
pierre
took
him
up
invited
him
to
his
house
in
petersburg
and
now
she
has
come
here
and
that
daredevil
after
her
said
anna
mikhaylovna
wishing
to
show
her
sympathy
for
pierre
but
by
involuntary
intonations
and
a
half
smile
betraying
her
sympathy
for
the
daredevil
as
she
called
dolokhov
they
say
pierre
is
quite
broken
by
his
misfortune
dear
dear
but
still
tell
him
to
come
to
the
club
it
will
all
blow
over
it
will
be
a
tremendous
banquet
next
day
the
third
of
march
soon
after
one
o
clock
two
hundred
and
fifty
members
of
the
english
club
and
fifty
guests
were
awaiting
the
guest
of
honor
and
hero
of
the
austrian
campaign
prince
bagration
to
dinner
on
the
first
arrival
of
the
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
moscow
had
been
bewildered
at
that
time
the
russians
were
so
used
to
victories
that
on
receiving
news
of
the
defeat
some
would
simply
not
believe
it
while
others
sought
some
extraordinary
explanation
of
so
strange
an
event
in
the
english
club
where
all
who
were
distinguished
important
and
well
informed
foregathered
when
the
news
began
to
arrive
in
december
nothing
was
said
about
the
war
and
the
last
battle
as
though
all
were
in
a
conspiracy
of
silence
the
men
who
set
the
tone
in
conversation
count
rostopchin
prince
yuri
dolgorukov
valuev
count
markov
and
prince
vyazemski
did
not
show
themselves
at
the
club
but
met
in
private
houses
in
intimate
circles
and
the
moscovites
who
took
their
opinions
from
others
ilya
rostov
among
them
remained
for
a
while
without
any
definite
opinion
on
the
subject
of
the
war
and
without
leaders
the
moscovites
felt
that
something
was
wrong
and
that
to
discuss
the
bad
news
was
difficult
and
so
it
was
best
to
be
silent
but
after
a
while
just
as
a
jury
comes
out
of
its
room
the
bigwigs
who
guided
the
club
s
opinion
reappeared
and
everybody
began
speaking
clearly
and
definitely
reasons
were
found
for
the
incredible
unheard
of
and
impossible
event
of
a
russian
defeat
everything
became
clear
and
in
all
corners
of
moscow
the
same
things
began
to
be
said
these
reasons
were
the
treachery
of
the
austrians
a
defective
commissariat
the
treachery
of
the
pole
przebyszewski
and
of
the
frenchman
langeron
kutuzov
s
incapacity
and
it
was
whispered
the
youth
and
inexperience
of
the
sovereign
who
had
trusted
worthless
and
insignificant
people
but
the
army
the
russian
army
everyone
declared
was
extraordinary
and
had
achieved
miracles
of
valor
the
soldiers
officers
and
generals
were
heroes
but
the
hero
of
heroes
was
prince
bagration
distinguished
by
his
schon
grabern
affair
and
by
the
retreat
from
austerlitz
where
he
alone
had
withdrawn
his
column
unbroken
and
had
all
day
beaten
back
an
enemy
force
twice
as
numerous
as
his
own
what
also
conduced
to
bagration
s
being
selected
as
moscow
s
hero
was
the
fact
that
he
had
no
connections
in
the
city
and
was
a
stranger
there
in
his
person
honor
was
shown
to
a
simple
fighting
russian
soldier
without
connections
and
intrigues
and
to
one
who
was
associated
by
memories
of
the
italian
campaign
with
the
name
of
suvorov
moreover
paying
such
honor
to
bagration
was
the
best
way
of
expressing
disapproval
and
dislike
of
kutuzov
had
there
been
no
bagration
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
invent
him
said
the
wit
shinshin
parodying
the
words
of
voltaire
kutuzov
no
one
spoke
of
except
some
who
abused
him
in
whispers
calling
him
a
court
weathercock
and
an
old
satyr
all
moscow
repeated
prince
dolgorukov
s
saying
if
you
go
on
modeling
and
modeling
you
must
get
smeared
with
clay
suggesting
consolation
for
our
defeat
by
the
memory
of
former
victories
and
the
words
of
rostopchin
that
french
soldiers
have
to
be
incited
to
battle
by
highfalutin
words
and
germans
by
logical
arguments
to
show
them
that
it
is
more
dangerous
to
run
away
than
to
advance
but
that
russian
soldiers
only
need
to
be
restrained
and
held
back
on
all
sides
new
and
fresh
anecdotes
were
heard
of
individual
examples
of
heroism
shown
by
our
officers
and
men
at
austerlitz
one
had
saved
a
standard
another
had
killed
five
frenchmen
a
third
had
loaded
five
cannon
singlehanded
berg
was
mentioned
by
those
who
did
not
know
him
as
having
when
wounded
in
the
right
hand
taken
his
sword
in
the
left
and
gone
forward
of
bolkonski
nothing
was
said
and
only
those
who
knew
him
intimately
regretted
that
he
had
died
so
young
leaving
a
pregnant
wife
with
his
eccentric
father
chapter
iii
on
that
third
of
march
all
the
rooms
in
the
english
club
were
filled
with
a
hum
of
conversation
like
the
hum
of
bees
swarming
in
springtime
the
members
and
guests
of
the
club
wandered
hither
and
thither
sat
stood
met
and
separated
some
in
uniform
and
some
in
evening
dress
and
a
few
here
and
there
with
powdered
hair
and
in
russian
kaftans
powdered
footmen
in
livery
with
buckled
shoes
and
smart
stockings
stood
at
every
door
anxiously
noting
visitors
every
movement
in
order
to
offer
their
services
most
of
those
present
were
elderly
respected
men
with
broad
self
confident
faces
fat
fingers
and
resolute
gestures
and
voices
this
class
of
guests
and
members
sat
in
certain
habitual
places
and
met
in
certain
habitual
groups
a
minority
of
those
present
were
casual
guests
chiefly
young
men
among
whom
were
denisov
rostov
and
dolokhov
who
was
now
again
an
officer
in
the
semenov
regiment
the
faces
of
these
young
people
especially
those
who
were
military
men
bore
that
expression
of
condescending
respect
for
their
elders
which
seems
to
say
to
the
older
generation
we
are
prepared
to
respect
and
honor
you
but
all
the
same
remember
that
the
future
belongs
to
us
nesvitski
was
there
as
an
old
member
of
the
club
pierre
who
at
his
wife
s
command
had
let
his
hair
grow
and
abandoned
his
spectacles
went
about
the
rooms
fashionably
dressed
but
looking
sad
and
dull
here
as
elsewhere
he
was
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
subservience
to
his
wealth
and
being
in
the
habit
of
lording
it
over
these
people
he
treated
them
with
absent
minded
contempt
by
his
age
he
should
have
belonged
to
the
younger
men
but
by
his
wealth
and
connections
he
belonged
to
the
groups
of
old
and
honored
guests
and
so
he
went
from
one
group
to
another
some
of
the
most
important
old
men
were
the
center
of
groups
which
even
strangers
approached
respectfully
to
hear
the
voices
of
well
known
men
the
largest
circles
formed
round
count
rostopchin
valuev
and
naryshkin
rostopchin
was
describing
how
the
russians
had
been
overwhelmed
by
flying
austrians
and
had
had
to
force
their
way
through
them
with
bayonets
valuev
was
confidentially
telling
that
uvarov
had
been
sent
from
petersburg
to
ascertain
what
moscow
was
thinking
about
austerlitz
in
the
third
circle
naryshkin
was
speaking
of
the
meeting
of
the
austrian
council
of
war
at
which
suvorov
crowed
like
a
cock
in
reply
to
the
nonsense
talked
by
the
austrian
generals
shinshin
standing
close
by
tried
to
make
a
joke
saying
that
kutuzov
had
evidently
failed
to
learn
from
suvorov
even
so
simple
a
thing
as
the
art
of
crowing
like
a
cock
but
the
elder
members
glanced
severely
at
the
wit
making
him
feel
that
in
that
place
and
on
that
day
it
was
improper
to
speak
so
of
kutuzov
count
ilya
rostov
hurried
and
preoccupied
went
about
in
his
soft
boots
between
the
dining
and
drawing
rooms
hastily
greeting
the
important
and
unimportant
all
of
whom
he
knew
as
if
they
were
all
equals
while
his
eyes
occasionally
sought
out
his
fine
well
set
up
young
son
resting
on
him
and
winking
joyfully
at
him
young
rostov
stood
at
a
window
with
dolokhov
whose
acquaintance
he
had
lately
made
and
highly
valued
the
old
count
came
up
to
them
and
pressed
dolokhov
s
hand
please
come
and
visit
us
you
know
my
brave
boy
been
together
out
there
both
playing
the
hero
ah
vasili
ignatovich
how
d
ye
do
old
fellow
he
said
turning
to
an
old
man
who
was
passing
but
before
he
had
finished
his
greeting
there
was
a
general
stir
and
a
footman
who
had
run
in
announced
with
a
frightened
face
he
s
arrived
bells
rang
the
stewards
rushed
forward
and
like
rye
shaken
together
in
a
shovel
the
guests
who
had
been
scattered
about
in
different
rooms
came
together
and
crowded
in
the
large
drawing
room
by
the
door
of
the
ballroom
bagration
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
anteroom
without
hat
or
sword
which
in
accord
with
the
club
custom
he
had
given
up
to
the
hall
porter
he
had
no
lambskin
cap
on
his
head
nor
had
he
a
loaded
whip
over
his
shoulder
as
when
rostov
had
seen
him
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
but
wore
a
tight
new
uniform
with
russian
and
foreign
orders
and
the
star
of
st
george
on
his
left
breast
evidently
just
before
coming
to
the
dinner
he
had
had
his
hair
and
whiskers
trimmed
which
changed
his
appearance
for
the
worse
there
was
something
naively
festive
in
his
air
which
in
conjunction
with
his
firm
and
virile
features
gave
him
a
rather
comical
expression
bekleshev
and
theodore
uvarov
who
had
arrived
with
him
paused
at
the
doorway
to
allow
him
as
the
guest
of
honor
to
enter
first
bagration
was
embarrassed
not
wishing
to
avail
himself
of
their
courtesy
and
this
caused
some
delay
at
the
doors
but
after
all
he
did
at
last
enter
first
he
walked
shyly
and
awkwardly
over
the
parquet
floor
of
the
reception
room
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
his
hands
he
was
more
accustomed
to
walk
over
a
plowed
field
under
fire
as
he
had
done
at
the
head
of
the
kursk
regiment
at
schon
grabern
and
he
would
have
found
that
easier
the
committeemen
met
him
at
the
first
door
and
expressing
their
delight
at
seeing
such
a
highly
honored
guest
took
possession
of
him
as
it
were
without
waiting
for
his
reply
surrounded
him
and
led
him
to
the
drawing
room
it
was
at
first
impossible
to
enter
the
drawing
room
door
for
the
crowd
of
members
and
guests
jostling
one
another
and
trying
to
get
a
good
look
at
bagration
over
each
other
s
shoulders
as
if
he
were
some
rare
animal
count
ilya
rostov
laughing
and
repeating
the
words
make
way
dear
boy
make
way
make
way
pushed
through
the
crowd
more
energetically
than
anyone
led
the
guests
into
the
drawing
room
and
seated
them
on
the
center
sofa
the
bigwigs
the
most
respected
members
of
the
club
beset
the
new
arrivals
count
ilya
again
thrusting
his
way
through
the
crowd
went
out
of
the
drawing
room
and
reappeared
a
minute
later
with
another
committeeman
carrying
a
large
silver
salver
which
he
presented
to
prince
bagration
on
the
salver
lay
some
verses
composed
and
printed
in
the
hero
s
honor
bagration
on
seeing
the
salver
glanced
around
in
dismay
as
though
seeking
help
but
all
eyes
demanded
that
he
should
submit
feeling
himself
in
their
power
he
resolutely
took
the
salver
with
both
hands
and
looked
sternly
and
reproachfully
at
the
count
who
had
presented
it
to
him
someone
obligingly
took
the
dish
from
bagration
or
he
would
it
seemed
have
held
it
till
evening
and
have
gone
in
to
dinner
with
it
and
drew
his
attention
to
the
verses
well
i
will
read
them
then
bagration
seemed
to
say
and
fixing
his
weary
eyes
on
the
paper
began
to
read
them
with
a
fixed
and
serious
expression
but
the
author
himself
took
the
verses
and
began
reading
them
aloud
bagration
bowed
his
head
and
listened
bring
glory
then
to
alexander
s
reign
and
on
the
throne

and
dare
not
herculean
russians
trouble
but
before
he
had
finished
reading
a
stentorian
major
domo
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
the
door
opened
and
from
the
dining
room
came
the
resounding
strains
of
the
polonaise
conquest
s
joyful
thunder
waken
triumph
valiant
russians
now
and
count
rostov
glancing
angrily
at
the
author
who
went
on
reading
his
verses
bowed
to
bagration
everyone
rose
feeling
that
dinner
was
more
important
than
verses
and
bagration
again
preceding
all
the
rest
went
in
to
dinner
he
was
seated
in
the
place
of
honor
between
two
alexanders
bekleshev
and
naryshkin
which
was
a
significant
allusion
to
the
name
of
the
sovereign
three
hundred
persons
took
their
seats
in
the
dining
room
according
to
their
rank
and
importance
the
more
important
nearer
to
the
honored
guest
as
naturally
as
water
flows
deepest
where
the
land
lies
lowest
just
before
dinner
count
ilya
rostov
presented
his
son
to
bagration
who
recognized
him
and
said
a
few
words
to
him
disjointed
and
awkward
as
were
all
the
words
he
spoke
that
day
and
count
ilya
looked
joyfully
and
proudly
around
while
bagration
spoke
to
his
son
nicholas
rostov
with
denisov
and
his
new
acquaintance
dolokhov
sat
almost
at
the
middle
of
the
table
facing
them
sat
pierre
beside
prince
nesvitski
count
ilya
rostov
with
the
other
members
of
the
committee
sat
facing
bagration
and
as
the
very
personification
of
moscow
hospitality
did
the
honors
to
the
prince
his
efforts
had
not
been
in
vain
the
dinner
both
the
lenten
and
the
other
fare
was
splendid
yet
he
could
not
feel
quite
at
ease
till
the
end
of
the
meal
he
winked
at
the
butler
whispered
directions
to
the
footmen
and
awaited
each
expected
dish
with
some
anxiety
everything
was
excellent
with
the
second
course
a
gigantic
sterlet
at
sight
of
which
ilya
rostov
blushed
with
self
conscious
pleasure
the
footmen
began
popping
corks
and
filling
the
champagne
glasses
after
the
fish
which
made
a
certain
sensation
the
count
exchanged
glances
with
the
other
committeemen
there
will
be
many
toasts
it
s
time
to
begin
he
whispered
and
taking
up
his
glass
he
rose
all
were
silent
waiting
for
what
he
would
say
to
the
health
of
our
sovereign
the
emperor
he
cried
and
at
the
same
moment
his
kindly
eyes
grew
moist
with
tears
of
joy
and
enthusiasm
the
band
immediately
struck
up
conquest
s
joyful
thunder
waken
all
rose
and
cried
hurrah
bagration
also
rose
and
shouted
hurrah
in
exactly
the
same
voice
in
which
he
had
shouted
it
on
the
field
at
schon
grabern
young
rostov
s
ecstatic
voice
could
be
heard
above
the
three
hundred
others
he
nearly
wept
to
the
health
of
our
sovereign
the
emperor
he
roared
hurrah
and
emptying
his
glass
at
one
gulp
he
dashed
it
to
the
floor
many
followed
his
example
and
the
loud
shouting
continued
for
a
long
time
when
the
voices
subsided
the
footmen
cleared
away
the
broken
glass
and
everybody
sat
down
again
smiling
at
the
noise
they
had
made
and
exchanging
remarks
the
old
count
rose
once
more
glanced
at
a
note
lying
beside
his
plate
and
proposed
a
toast
to
the
health
of
the
hero
of
our
last
campaign
prince
peter
ivanovich
bagration
and
again
his
blue
eyes
grew
moist
hurrah
cried
the
three
hundred
voices
again
but
instead
of
the
band
a
choir
began
singing
a
cantata
composed
by
paul
ivanovich
kutuzov
russians
o
er
all
barriers
on
courage
conquest
guarantees
have
we
not
bagration
he
brings
foemen
to
their
knees
etc
as
soon
as
the
singing
was
over
another
and
another
toast
was
proposed
and
count
ilya
rostov
became
more
and
more
moved
more
glass
was
smashed
and
the
shouting
grew
louder
they
drank
to
bekleshev
naryshkin
uvarov
dolgorukov
apraksin
valuev
to
the
committee
to
all
the
club
members
and
to
all
the
club
guests
and
finally
to
count
ilya
rostov
separately
as
the
organizer
of
the
banquet
at
that
toast
the
count
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
covering
his
face
wept
outright
chapter
iv
pierre
sat
opposite
dolokhov
and
nicholas
rostov
as
usual
he
ate
and
drank
much
and
eagerly
but
those
who
knew
him
intimately
noticed
that
some
great
change
had
come
over
him
that
day
he
was
silent
all
through
dinner
and
looked
about
blinking
and
scowling
or
with
fixed
eyes
and
a
look
of
complete
absent
mindedness
kept
rubbing
the
bridge
of
his
nose
his
face
was
depressed
and
gloomy
he
seemed
to
see
and
hear
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
and
to
be
absorbed
by
some
depressing
and
unsolved
problem
the
unsolved
problem
that
tormented
him
was
caused
by
hints
given
by
the
princess
his
cousin
at
moscow
concerning
dolokhov
s
intimacy
with
his
wife
and
by
an
anonymous
letter
he
had
received
that
morning
which
in
the
mean
jocular
way
common
to
anonymous
letters
said
that
he
saw
badly
through
his
spectacles
but
that
his
wife
s
connection
with
dolokhov
was
a
secret
to
no
one
but
himself
pierre
absolutely
disbelieved
both
the
princess
hints
and
the
letter
but
he
feared
now
to
look
at
dolokhov
who
was
sitting
opposite
him
every
time
he
chanced
to
meet
dolokhov
s
handsome
insolent
eyes
pierre
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
in
his
soul
and
turned
quickly
away
involuntarily
recalling
his
wife
s
past
and
her
relations
with
dolokhov
pierre
saw
clearly
that
what
was
said
in
the
letter
might
be
true
or
might
at
least
seem
to
be
true
had
it
not
referred
to
his
wife
he
involuntarily
remembered
how
dolokhov
who
had
fully
recovered
his
former
position
after
the
campaign
had
returned
to
petersburg
and
come
to
him
availing
himself
of
his
friendly
relations
with
pierre
as
a
boon
companion
dolokhov
had
come
straight
to
his
house
and
pierre
had
put
him
up
and
lent
him
money
pierre
recalled
how
helene
had
smilingly
expressed
disapproval
of
dolokhov
s
living
at
their
house
and
how
cynically
dolokhov
had
praised
his
wife
s
beauty
to
him
and
from
that
time
till
they
came
to
moscow
had
not
left
them
for
a
day
yes
he
is
very
handsome
thought
pierre
and
i
know
him
it
would
be
particularly
pleasant
to
him
to
dishonor
my
name
and
ridicule
me
just
because
i
have
exerted
myself
on
his
behalf
befriended
him
and
helped
him
i
know
and
understand
what
a
spice
that
would
add
to
the
pleasure
of
deceiving
me
if
it
really
were
true
yes
if
it
were
true
but
i
do
not
believe
it
i
have
no
right
to
and
can
t
believe
it
he
remembered
the
expression
dolokhov
s
face
assumed
in
his
moments
of
cruelty
as
when
tying
the
policeman
to
the
bear
and
dropping
them
into
the
water
or
when
he
challenged
a
man
to
a
duel
without
any
reason
or
shot
a
post
boy
s
horse
with
a
pistol
that
expression
was
often
on
dolokhov
s
face
when
looking
at
him
yes
he
is
a
bully
thought
pierre
to
kill
a
man
means
nothing
to
him
it
must
seem
to
him
that
everyone
is
afraid
of
him
and
that
must
please
him
he
must
think
that
i
too
am
afraid
of
him
and
in
fact
i
am
afraid
of
him
he
thought
and
again
he
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
in
his
soul
dolokhov
denisov
and
rostov
were
now
sitting
opposite
pierre
and
seemed
very
gay
rostov
was
talking
merrily
to
his
two
friends
one
of
whom
was
a
dashing
hussar
and
the
other
a
notorious
duelist
and
rake
and
every
now
and
then
he
glanced
ironically
at
pierre
whose
preoccupied
absent
minded
and
massive
figure
was
a
very
noticeable
one
at
the
dinner
rostov
looked
inimically
at
pierre
first
because
pierre
appeared
to
his
hussar
eyes
as
a
rich
civilian
the
husband
of
a
beauty
and
in
a
word
an
old
woman
and
secondly
because
pierre
in
his
preoccupation
and
absent
mindedness
had
not
recognized
rostov
and
had
not
responded
to
his
greeting
when
the
emperor
s
health
was
drunk
pierre
lost
in
thought
did
not
rise
or
lift
his
glass
what
are
you
about
shouted
rostov
looking
at
him
in
an
ecstasy
of
exasperation
don
t
you
hear
it
s
his
majesty
the
emperor
s
health
pierre
sighed
rose
submissively
emptied
his
glass
and
waiting
till
all
were
seated
again
turned
with
his
kindly
smile
to
rostov
why
i
didn
t
recognize
you
he
said
but
rostov
was
otherwise
engaged
he
was
shouting
hurrah
why
don
t
you
renew
the
acquaintance
said
dolokhov
to
rostov
confound
him
he
s
a
fool
said
rostov
one
should
make
up
to
the
husbands
of
pretty
women
said
denisov
pierre
did
not
catch
what
they
were
saying
but
knew
they
were
talking
about
him
he
reddened
and
turned
away
well
now
to
the
health
of
handsome
women
said
dolokhov
and
with
a
serious
expression
but
with
a
smile
lurking
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
turned
with
his
glass
to
pierre
here
s
to
the
health
of
lovely
women
peterkin
and
their
lovers
he
added
pierre
with
downcast
eyes
drank
out
of
his
glass
without
looking
at
dolokhov
or
answering
him
the
footman
who
was
distributing
leaflets
with
kutuzov
s
cantata
laid
one
before
pierre
as
one
of
the
principal
guests
he
was
just
going
to
take
it
when
dolokhov
leaning
across
snatched
it
from
his
hand
and
began
reading
it
pierre
looked
at
dolokhov
and
his
eyes
dropped
the
something
terrible
and
monstrous
that
had
tormented
him
all
dinnertime
rose
and
took
possession
of
him
he
leaned
his
whole
massive
body
across
the
table
how
dare
you
take
it
he
shouted
hearing
that
cry
and
seeing
to
whom
it
was
addressed
nesvitski
and
the
neighbor
on
his
right
quickly
turned
in
alarm
to
bezukhov
don
t
don
t
what
are
you
about
whispered
their
frightened
voices
dolokhov
looked
at
pierre
with
clear
mirthful
cruel
eyes
and
that
smile
of
his
which
seemed
to
say
ah
this
is
what
i
like
you
shan
t
have
it
he
said
distinctly
pale
with
quivering
lips
pierre
snatched
the
copy
you
you
scoundrel
i
challenge
you
he
ejaculated
and
pushing
back
his
chair
he
rose
from
the
table
at
the
very
instant
he
did
this
and
uttered
those
words
pierre
felt
that
the
question
of
his
wife
s
guilt
which
had
been
tormenting
him
the
whole
day
was
finally
and
indubitably
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
hated
her
and
was
forever
sundered
from
her
despite
denisov
s
request
that
he
would
take
no
part
in
the
matter
rostov
agreed
to
be
dolokhov
s
second
and
after
dinner
he
discussed
the
arrangements
for
the
duel
with
nesvitski
bezukhov
s
second
pierre
went
home
but
rostov
with
dolokhov
and
denisov
stayed
on
at
the
club
till
late
listening
to
the
gypsies
and
other
singers
well
then
till
tomorrow
at
sokolniki
said
dolokhov
as
he
took
leave
of
rostov
in
the
club
porch
and
do
you
feel
quite
calm
rostov
asked
dolokhov
paused
well
you
see
i
ll
tell
you
the
whole
secret
of
dueling
in
two
words
if
you
are
going
to
fight
a
duel
and
you
make
a
will
and
write
affectionate
letters
to
your
parents
and
if
you
think
you
may
be
killed
you
are
a
fool
and
are
lost
for
certain
but
go
with
the
firm
intention
of
killing
your
man
as
quickly
and
surely
as
possible
and
then
all
will
be
right
as
our
bear
huntsman
at
kostroma
used
to
tell
me
everyone
fears
a
bear
he
says
but
when
you
see
one
your
fear
s
all
gone
and
your
only
thought
is
not
to
let
him
get
away
and
that
s
how
it
is
with
me
a
demain
mon
cher
till
tomorrow
my
dear
fellow
next
day
at
eight
in
the
morning
pierre
and
nesvitski
drove
to
the
sokolniki
forest
and
found
dolokhov
denisov
and
rostov
already
there
pierre
had
the
air
of
a
man
preoccupied
with
considerations
which
had
no
connection
with
the
matter
in
hand
his
haggard
face
was
yellow
he
had
evidently
not
slept
that
night
he
looked
about
distractedly
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
as
if
dazzled
by
the
sun
he
was
entirely
absorbed
by
two
considerations
his
wife
s
guilt
of
which
after
his
sleepless
night
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
and
the
guiltlessness
of
dolokhov
who
had
no
reason
to
preserve
the
honor
of
a
man
who
was
nothing
to
him
i
should
perhaps
have
done
the
same
thing
in
his
place
thought
pierre
it
s
even
certain
that
i
should
have
done
the
same
then
why
this
duel
this
murder
either
i
shall
kill
him
or
he
will
hit
me
in
the
head
or
elbow
or
knee
can
t
i
go
away
from
here
run
away
bury
myself
somewhere
passed
through
his
mind
but
just
at
moments
when
such
thoughts
occurred
to
him
he
would
ask
in
a
particularly
calm
and
absent
minded
way
which
inspired
the
respect
of
the
onlookers
will
it
be
long
are
things
ready
when
all
was
ready
the
sabers
stuck
in
the
snow
to
mark
the
barriers
and
the
pistols
loaded
nesvitski
went
up
to
pierre
i
should
not
be
doing
my
duty
count
he
said
in
timid
tones
and
should
not
justify
your
confidence
and
the
honor
you
have
done
me
in
choosing
me
for
your
second
if
at
this
grave
this
very
grave
moment
i
did
not
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
think
there
is
no
sufficient
ground
for
this
affair
or
for
blood
to
be
shed
over
it
you
were
not
right
not
quite
in
the
right
you
were
impetuous
oh
yes
it
is
horribly
stupid
said
pierre
then
allow
me
to
express
your
regrets
and
i
am
sure
your
opponent
will
accept
them
said
nesvitski
who
like
the
others
concerned
in
the
affair
and
like
everyone
in
similar
cases
did
not
yet
believe
that
the
affair
had
come
to
an
actual
duel
you
know
count
it
is
much
more
honorable
to
admit
one
s
mistake
than
to
let
matters
become
irreparable
there
was
no
insult
on
either
side
allow
me
to
convey
no
what
is
there
to
talk
about
said
pierre
it
s
all
the
same
is
everything
ready
he
added
only
tell
me
where
to
go
and
where
to
shoot
he
said
with
an
unnaturally
gentle
smile
he
took
the
pistol
in
his
hand
and
began
asking
about
the
working
of
the
trigger
as
he
had
not
before
held
a
pistol
in
his
hand
a
fact
that
he
did
not
wish
to
confess
oh
yes
like
that
i
know
i
only
forgot
said
he
no
apologies
none
whatever
said
dolokhov
to
denisov
who
on
his
side
had
been
attempting
a
reconciliation
and
he
also
went
up
to
the
appointed
place
the
spot
chosen
for
the
duel
was
some
eighty
paces
from
the
road
where
the
sleighs
had
been
left
in
a
small
clearing
in
the
pine
forest
covered
with
melting
snow
the
frost
having
begun
to
break
up
during
the
last
few
days
the
antagonists
stood
forty
paces
apart
at
the
farther
edge
of
the
clearing
the
seconds
measuring
the
paces
left
tracks
in
the
deep
wet
snow
between
the
place
where
they
had
been
standing
and
nesvitski
s
and
dolokhov
s
sabers
which
were
stuck
into
the
ground
ten
paces
apart
to
mark
the
barrier
it
was
thawing
and
misty
at
forty
paces
distance
nothing
could
be
seen
for
three
minutes
all
had
been
ready
but
they
still
delayed
and
all
were
silent
chapter
v
well
begin
said
dolokhov
all
right
said
pierre
still
smiling
in
the
same
way
a
feeling
of
dread
was
in
the
air
it
was
evident
that
the
affair
so
lightly
begun
could
no
longer
be
averted
but
was
taking
its
course
independently
of
men
s
will
denisov
first
went
to
the
barrier
and
announced
as
the
adve
sawies
have
wefused
a
weconciliation
please
pwoceed
take
your
pistols
and
at
the
word
thwee
begin
to
advance
o
ne
t
wo
thwee
he
shouted
angrily
and
stepped
aside
the
combatants
advanced
along
the
trodden
tracks
nearer
and
nearer
to
one
another
beginning
to
see
one
another
through
the
mist
they
had
the
right
to
fire
when
they
liked
as
they
approached
the
barrier
dolokhov
walked
slowly
without
raising
his
pistol
looking
intently
with
his
bright
sparkling
blue
eyes
into
his
antagonist
s
face
his
mouth
wore
its
usual
semblance
of
a
smile
so
i
can
fire
when
i
like
said
pierre
and
at
the
word
three
he
went
quickly
forward
missing
the
trodden
path
and
stepping
into
the
deep
snow
he
held
the
pistol
in
his
right
hand
at
arm
s
length
apparently
afraid
of
shooting
himself
with
it
his
left
hand
he
held
carefully
back
because
he
wished
to
support
his
right
hand
with
it
and
knew
he
must
not
do
so
having
advanced
six
paces
and
strayed
off
the
track
into
the
snow
pierre
looked
down
at
his
feet
then
quickly
glanced
at
dolokhov
and
bending
his
finger
as
he
had
been
shown
fired
not
at
all
expecting
so
loud
a
report
pierre
shuddered
at
the
sound
and
then
smiling
at
his
own
sensations
stood
still
the
smoke
rendered
denser
by
the
mist
prevented
him
from
seeing
anything
for
an
instant
but
there
was
no
second
report
as
he
had
expected
he
only
heard
dolokhov
s
hurried
steps
and
his
figure
came
in
view
through
the
smoke
he
was
pressing
one
hand
to
his
left
side
while
the
other
clutched
his
drooping
pistol
his
face
was
pale
rostov
ran
toward
him
and
said
something
no
o
o
muttered
dolokhov
through
his
teeth
no
it
s
not
over
and
after
stumbling
a
few
staggering
steps
right
up
to
the
saber
he
sank
on
the
snow
beside
it
his
left
hand
was
bloody
he
wiped
it
on
his
coat
and
supported
himself
with
it
his
frowning
face
was
pallid
and
quivered
plea
began
dolokhov
but
could
not
at
first
pronounce
the
word
please
he
uttered
with
an
effort
pierre
hardly
restraining
his
sobs
began
running
toward
dolokhov
and
was
about
to
cross
the
space
between
the
barriers
when
dolokhov
cried
to
your
barrier
and
pierre
grasping
what
was
meant
stopped
by
his
saber
only
ten
paces
divided
them
dolokhov
lowered
his
head
to
the
snow
greedily
bit
at
it
again
raised
his
head
adjusted
himself
drew
in
his
legs
and
sat
up
seeking
a
firm
center
of
gravity
he
sucked
and
swallowed
the
cold
snow
his
lips
quivered
but
his
eyes
still
smiling
glittered
with
effort
and
exasperation
as
he
mustered
his
remaining
strength
he
raised
his
pistol
and
aimed
sideways
cover
yourself
with
your
pistol
ejaculated
nesvitski
cover
yourself
even
denisov
cried
to
his
adversary
pierre
with
a
gentle
smile
of
pity
and
remorse
his
arms
and
legs
helplessly
spread
out
stood
with
his
broad
chest
directly
facing
dolokhov
and
looked
sorrowfully
at
him
denisov
rostov
and
nesvitski
closed
their
eyes
at
the
same
instant
they
heard
a
report
and
dolokhov
s
angry
cry
missed
shouted
dolokhov
and
he
lay
helplessly
face
downwards
on
the
snow
pierre
clutched
his
temples
and
turning
round
went
into
the
forest
trampling
through
the
deep
snow
and
muttering
incoherent
words
folly
folly
death
lies
he
repeated
puckering
his
face
nesvitski
stopped
him
and
took
him
home
rostov
and
denisov
drove
away
with
the
wounded
dolokhov
the
latter
lay
silent
in
the
sleigh
with
closed
eyes
and
did
not
answer
a
word
to
the
questions
addressed
to
him
but
on
entering
moscow
he
suddenly
came
to
and
lifting
his
head
with
an
effort
took
rostov
who
was
sitting
beside
him
by
the
hand
rostov
was
struck
by
the
totally
altered
and
unexpectedly
rapturous
and
tender
expression
on
dolokhov
s
face
well
how
do
you
feel
he
asked
bad
but
it
s
not
that
my
friend
said
dolokhov
with
a
gasping
voice
where
are
we
in
moscow
i
know
i
don
t
matter
but
i
have
killed
her
killed
she
won
t
get
over
it
she
won
t
survive
who
asked
rostov
my
mother
my
mother
my
angel
my
adored
angel
mother
and
dolokhov
pressed
rostov
s
hand
and
burst
into
tears
when
he
had
become
a
little
quieter
he
explained
to
rostov
that
he
was
living
with
his
mother
who
if
she
saw
him
dying
would
not
survive
it
he
implored
rostov
to
go
on
and
prepare
her
rostov
went
on
ahead
to
do
what
was
asked
and
to
his
great
surprise
learned
that
dolokhov
the
brawler
dolokhov
the
bully
lived
in
moscow
with
an
old
mother
and
a
hunchback
sister
and
was
the
most
affectionate
of
sons
and
brothers
chapter
vi
pierre
had
of
late
rarely
seen
his
wife
alone
both
in
petersburg
and
in
moscow
their
house
was
always
full
of
visitors
the
night
after
the
duel
he
did
not
go
to
his
bedroom
but
as
he
often
did
remained
in
his
father
s
room
that
huge
room
in
which
count
bezukhov
had
died
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
meaning
to
fall
asleep
and
forget
all
that
had
happened
to
him
but
could
not
do
so
such
a
storm
of
feelings
thoughts
and
memories
suddenly
arose
within
him
that
he
could
not
fall
asleep
nor
even
remain
in
one
place
but
had
to
jump
up
and
pace
the
room
with
rapid
steps
now
he
seemed
to
see
her
in
the
early
days
of
their
marriage
with
bare
shoulders
and
a
languid
passionate
look
on
her
face
and
then
immediately
he
saw
beside
her
dolokhov
s
handsome
insolent
hard
and
mocking
face
as
he
had
seen
it
at
the
banquet
and
then
that
same
face
pale
quivering
and
suffering
as
it
had
been
when
he
reeled
and
sank
on
the
snow
what
has
happened
he
asked
himself
i
have
killed
her
lover
yes
killed
my
wife
s
lover
yes
that
was
it
and
why
how
did
i
come
to
do
it
because
you
married
her
answered
an
inner
voice
but
in
what
was
i
to
blame
he
asked
in
marrying
her
without
loving
her
in
deceiving
yourself
and
her
and
he
vividly
recalled
that
moment
after
supper
at
prince
vasili
s
when
he
spoke
those
words
he
had
found
so
difficult
to
utter
i
love
you
it
all
comes
from
that
even
then
i
felt
it
he
thought
i
felt
then
that
it
was
not
so
that
i
had
no
right
to
do
it
and
so
it
turns
out
he
remembered
his
honeymoon
and
blushed
at
the
recollection
particularly
vivid
humiliating
and
shameful
was
the
recollection
of
how
one
day
soon
after
his
marriage
he
came
out
of
the
bedroom
into
his
study
a
little
before
noon
in
his
silk
dressing
gown
and
found
his
head
steward
there
who
bowing
respectfully
looked
into
his
face
and
at
his
dressing
gown
and
smiled
slightly
as
if
expressing
respectful
understanding
of
his
employer
s
happiness
but
how
often
i
have
felt
proud
of
her
proud
of
her
majestic
beauty
and
social
tact
thought
he
been
proud
of
my
house
in
which
she
received
all
petersburg
proud
of
her
unapproachability
and
beauty
so
this
is
what
i
was
proud
of
i
then
thought
that
i
did
not
understand
her
how
often
when
considering
her
character
i
have
told
myself
that
i
was
to
blame
for
not
understanding
her
for
not
understanding
that
constant
composure
and
complacency
and
lack
of
all
interests
or
desires
and
the
whole
secret
lies
in
the
terrible
truth
that
she
is
a
depraved
woman
now
i
have
spoken
that
terrible
word
to
myself
all
has
become
clear
anatole
used
to
come
to
borrow
money
from
her
and
used
to
kiss
her
naked
shoulders
she
did
not
give
him
the
money
but
let
herself
be
kissed
her
father
in
jest
tried
to
rouse
her
jealousy
and
she
replied
with
a
calm
smile
that
she
was
not
so
stupid
as
to
be
jealous
let
him
do
what
he
pleases
she
used
to
say
of
me
one
day
i
asked
her
if
she
felt
any
symptoms
of
pregnancy
she
laughed
contemptuously
and
said
she
was
not
a
fool
to
want
to
have
children
and
that
she
was
not
going
to
have
any
children
by
me
then
he
recalled
the
coarseness
and
bluntness
of
her
thoughts
and
the
vulgarity
of
the
expressions
that
were
natural
to
her
though
she
had
been
brought
up
in
the
most
aristocratic
circles
i
m
not
such
a
fool
just
you
try
it
on
allez
vous
promener
she
used
to
say
often
seeing
the
success
she
had
with
young
and
old
men
and
women
pierre
could
not
understand
why
he
did
not
love
her
you
clear
out
of
this
yes
i
never
loved
her
said
he
to
himself
i
knew
she
was
a
depraved
woman
he
repeated
but
dared
not
admit
it
to
myself
and
now
there
s
dolokhov
sitting
in
the
snow
with
a
forced
smile
and
perhaps
dying
while
meeting
my
remorse
with
some
forced
bravado
pierre
was
one
of
those
people
who
in
spite
of
an
appearance
of
what
is
called
weak
character
do
not
seek
a
confidant
in
their
troubles
he
digested
his
sufferings
alone
it
is
all
all
her
fault
he
said
to
himself
but
what
of
that
why
did
i
bind
myself
to
her
why
did
i
say
je
vous
aime
to
her
which
was
a
lie
and
worse
than
a
lie
i
am
guilty
and
must
endure
what
a
slur
on
my
name
a
misfortune
for
life
oh
that
s
nonsense
he
thought
the
slur
on
my
name
and
honor
that
s
all
apart
from
myself
i
love
you
louis
xvi
was
executed
because
they
said
he
was
dishonorable
and
a
criminal
came
into
pierre
s
head
and
from
their
point
of
view
they
were
right
as
were
those
too
who
canonized
him
and
died
a
martyr
s
death
for
his
sake
then
robespierre
was
beheaded
for
being
a
despot
who
is
right
and
who
is
wrong
no
one
but
if
you
are
alive
live
tomorrow
you
ll
die
as
i
might
have
died
an
hour
ago
and
is
it
worth
tormenting
oneself
when
one
has
only
a
moment
of
life
in
comparison
with
eternity
but
at
the
moment
when
he
imagined
himself
calmed
by
such
reflections
she
suddenly
came
into
his
mind
as
she
was
at
the
moments
when
he
had
most
strongly
expressed
his
insincere
love
for
her
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
and
had
again
to
get
up
and
move
about
and
break
and
tear
whatever
came
to
his
hand
why
did
i
tell
her
that
je
vous
aime
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
and
when
he
had
said
it
for
the
tenth
time
moliere
s
words
mais
que
diable
allait
il
faire
dans
cette
galere
occurred
to
him
and
he
began
to
laugh
at
himself
but
what
the
devil
was
he
doing
in
that
galley
in
the
night
he
called
his
valet
and
told
him
to
pack
up
to
go
to
petersburg
he
could
not
imagine
how
he
could
speak
to
her
now
he
resolved
to
go
away
next
day
and
leave
a
letter
informing
her
of
his
intention
to
part
from
her
forever
next
morning
when
the
valet
came
into
the
room
with
his
coffee
pierre
was
lying
asleep
on
the
ottoman
with
an
open
book
in
his
hand
he
woke
up
and
looked
round
for
a
while
with
a
startled
expression
unable
to
realize
where
he
was
the
countess
told
me
to
inquire
whether
your
excellency
was
at
home
said
the
valet
but
before
pierre
could
decide
what
answer
he
would
send
the
countess
herself
in
a
white
satin
dressing
gown
embroidered
with
silver
and
with
simply
dressed
hair
two
immense
plaits
twice
round
her
lovely
head
like
a
coronet
entered
the
room
calm
and
majestic
except
that
there
was
a
wrathful
wrinkle
on
her
rather
prominent
marble
brow
with
her
imperturbable
calm
she
did
not
begin
to
speak
in
front
of
the
valet
she
knew
of
the
duel
and
had
come
to
speak
about
it
she
waited
till
the
valet
had
set
down
the
coffee
things
and
left
the
room
pierre
looked
at
her
timidly
over
his
spectacles
and
like
a
hare
surrounded
by
hounds
who
lays
back
her
ears
and
continues
to
crouch
motionless
before
her
enemies
he
tried
to
continue
reading
but
feeling
this
to
be
senseless
and
impossible
he
again
glanced
timidly
at
her
she
did
not
sit
down
but
looked
at
him
with
a
contemptuous
smile
waiting
for
the
valet
to
go
well
what
s
this
now
what
have
you
been
up
to
now
i
should
like
to
know
she
asked
sternly
i
what
have
i
stammered
pierre
so
it
seems
you
re
a
hero
eh
come
now
what
was
this
duel
about
what
is
it
meant
to
prove
what
i
ask
you
pierre
turned
over
heavily
on
the
ottoman
and
opened
his
mouth
but
could
not
reply
if
you
won
t
answer
i
ll
tell
you
helene
went
on
you
believe
everything
you
re
told
you
were
told
helene
laughed
that
dolokhov
was
my
lover
she
said
in
french
with
her
coarse
plainness
of
speech
uttering
the
word
amant
as
casually
as
any
other
word
and
you
believed
it
well
what
have
you
proved
what
does
this
duel
prove
that
you
re
a
fool
que
vous
etes
un
sot
but
everybody
knew
that
what
will
be
the
result
that
i
shall
be
the
laughingstock
of
all
moscow
that
everyone
will
say
that
you
drunk
and
not
knowing
what
you
were
about
challenged
a
man
you
are
jealous
of
without
cause
helene
raised
her
voice
and
became
more
and
more
excited
a
man
who
s
a
better
man
than
you
in
every
way
hm
hm
growled
pierre
frowning
without
looking
at
her
and
not
moving
a
muscle
and
how
could
you
believe
he
was
my
lover
why
because
i
like
his
company
if
you
were
cleverer
and
more
agreeable
i
should
prefer
yours
don
t
speak
to
me
i
beg
you
muttered
pierre
hoarsely
why
shouldn
t
i
speak
i
can
speak
as
i
like
and
i
tell
you
plainly
that
there
are
not
many
wives
with
husbands
such
as
you
who
would
not
have
taken
lovers
des
amants
but
i
have
not
done
so
said
she
pierre
wished
to
say
something
looked
at
her
with
eyes
whose
strange
expression
she
did
not
understand
and
lay
down
again
he
was
suffering
physically
at
that
moment
there
was
a
weight
on
his
chest
and
he
could
not
breathe
he
knew
that
he
must
do
something
to
put
an
end
to
this
suffering
but
what
he
wanted
to
do
was
too
terrible
we
had
better
separate
he
muttered
in
a
broken
voice
separate
very
well
but
only
if
you
give
me
a
fortune
said
helene
separate
that
s
a
thing
to
frighten
me
with
pierre
leaped
up
from
the
sofa
and
rushed
staggering
toward
her
i
ll
kill
you
he
shouted
and
seizing
the
marble
top
of
a
table
with
a
strength
he
had
never
before
felt
he
made
a
step
toward
her
brandishing
the
slab
helene
s
face
became
terrible
she
shrieked
and
sprang
aside
his
father
s
nature
showed
itself
in
pierre
he
felt
the
fascination
and
delight
of
frenzy
he
flung
down
the
slab
broke
it
and
swooping
down
on
her
with
outstretched
hands
shouted
get
out
in
such
a
terrible
voice
that
the
whole
house
heard
it
with
horror
god
knows
what
he
would
have
done
at
that
moment
had
helene
not
fled
from
the
room
a
week
later
pierre
gave
his
wife
full
power
to
control
all
his
estates
in
great
russia
which
formed
the
larger
part
of
his
property
and
left
for
petersburg
alone
chapter
vii
two
months
had
elapsed
since
the
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
and
the
loss
of
prince
andrew
had
reached
bald
hills
and
in
spite
of
the
letters
sent
through
the
embassy
and
all
the
searches
made
his
body
had
not
been
found
nor
was
he
on
the
list
of
prisoners
what
was
worst
of
all
for
his
relations
was
the
fact
that
there
was
still
a
possibility
of
his
having
been
picked
up
on
the
battlefield
by
the
people
of
the
place
and
that
he
might
now
be
lying
recovering
or
dying
alone
among
strangers
and
unable
to
send
news
of
himself
the
gazettes
from
which
the
old
prince
first
heard
of
the
defeat
at
austerlitz
stated
as
usual
very
briefly
and
vaguely
that
after
brilliant
engagements
the
russians
had
had
to
retreat
and
had
made
their
withdrawal
in
perfect
order
the
old
prince
understood
from
this
official
report
that
our
army
had
been
defeated
a
week
after
the
gazette
report
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
came
a
letter
from
kutuzov
informing
the
prince
of
the
fate
that
had
befallen
his
son
your
son
wrote
kutuzov
fell
before
my
eyes
a
standard
in
his
hand
and
at
the
head
of
a
regiment
he
fell
as
a
hero
worthy
of
his
father
and
his
fatherland
to
the
great
regret
of
myself
and
of
the
whole
army
it
is
still
uncertain
whether
he
is
alive
or
not
i
comfort
myself
and
you
with
the
hope
that
your
son
is
alive
for
otherwise
he
would
have
been
mentioned
among
the
officers
found
on
the
field
of
battle
a
list
of
whom
has
been
sent
me
under
flag
of
truce
after
receiving
this
news
late
in
the
evening
when
he
was
alone
in
his
study
the
old
prince
went
for
his
walk
as
usual
next
morning
but
he
was
silent
with
his
steward
the
gardener
and
the
architect
and
though
he
looked
very
grim
he
said
nothing
to
anyone
when
princess
mary
went
to
him
at
the
usual
hour
he
was
working
at
his
lathe
and
as
usual
did
not
look
round
at
her
ah
princess
mary
he
said
suddenly
in
an
unnatural
voice
throwing
down
his
chisel
the
wheel
continued
to
revolve
by
its
own
impetus
and
princess
mary
long
remembered
the
dying
creak
of
that
wheel
which
merged
in
her
memory
with
what
followed
she
approached
him
saw
his
face
and
something
gave
way
within
her
her
eyes
grew
dim
by
the
expression
of
her
father
s
face
not
sad
not
crushed
but
angry
and
working
unnaturally
she
saw
that
hanging
over
her
and
about
to
crush
her
was
some
terrible
misfortune
the
worst
in
life
one
she
had
not
yet
experienced
irreparable
and
incomprehensible
the
death
of
one
she
loved
father
andrew
said
the
ungraceful
awkward
princess
with
such
an
indescribable
charm
of
sorrow
and
self
forgetfulness
that
her
father
could
not
bear
her
look
but
turned
away
with
a
sob
bad
news
he
s
not
among
the
prisoners
nor
among
the
killed
kutuzov
writes
and
he
screamed
as
piercingly
as
if
he
wished
to
drive
the
princess
away
by
that
scream
killed
the
princess
did
not
fall
down
or
faint
she
was
already
pale
but
on
hearing
these
words
her
face
changed
and
something
brightened
in
her
beautiful
radiant
eyes
it
was
as
if
joy
a
supreme
joy
apart
from
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
this
world
overflowed
the
great
grief
within
her
she
forgot
all
fear
of
her
father
went
up
to
him
took
his
hand
and
drawing
him
down
put
her
arm
round
his
thin
scraggy
neck
father
she
said
do
not
turn
away
from
me
let
us
weep
together
scoundrels
blackguards
shrieked
the
old
man
turning
his
face
away
from
her
destroying
the
army
destroying
the
men
and
why
go
go
and
tell
lise
the
princess
sank
helplessly
into
an
armchair
beside
her
father
and
wept
she
saw
her
brother
now
as
he
had
been
at
the
moment
when
he
took
leave
of
her
and
of
lise
his
look
tender
yet
proud
she
saw
him
tender

asked

will

when
princess
mary
returned
from
her
father
the
little
princess
sat
working
and
looked
up
with
that
curious
expression
of
inner
happy
calm
peculiar
to
pregnant
women
it
was
evident
that
her
eyes
did
not
see
princess
mary
but
were
looking
within
into
herself
at
something
joyful
and
mysterious
taking
place
within
her
mary
she
said
moving
away
from
the
embroidery
frame
and
lying
back
give
me
your
hand
she
took
her
sister
in
law
s
hand
and
held
it
below
her
waist
her
eyes
were
smiling
expectantly
her
downy
lip
rose
and
remained
lifted
in
childlike
happiness
princess
mary
knelt
down
before
her
and
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
her
sister
in
law
s
dress
there
there
do
you
feel
it
i
feel
so
strange
and
do
you
know
mary

am
going
to
love

very
much
said
lise
looking
with
bright
and
happy
eyes
at
her
sister
in
law
princess
mary
could
not
lift
her
head
she
was
weeping
what
is
the
matter
mary
nothing
only
i
feel
sad
sad
about
andrew
she
said
wiping
away
her
tears
on
her
sister
in
law
s
knee
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
princess
mary
began
trying
to
prepare
her
sister
in
law
and
every
time
began
to
cry
unobservant
as
was
the
little
princess
these
tears
the
cause
of
which
she
did
not
understand
agitated
her
she
said
nothing
but
looked
about
uneasily
as
if
in
search
of
something
before
dinner
the
old
prince
of
whom
she
was
always
afraid
came
into
her
room
with
a
peculiarly
restless
and
malign
expression
and
went
out
again
without
saying
a
word
she
looked
at
princess
mary
then
sat
thinking
for
a
while
with
that
expression
of
attention
to
something
within
her
that
is
only
seen
in
pregnant
women
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
has
anything
come
from
andrew
she
asked
no
you
know
it
s
too
soon
for
news
but
my
father
is
anxious
and
i
feel
afraid
so
there
s
nothing
nothing
answered
princess
mary
looking
firmly
with
her
radiant
eyes
at
her
sister
in
law
she
had
determined
not
to
tell
her
and
persuaded
her
father
to
hide
the
terrible
news
from
her
till
after
her
confinement
which
was
expected
within
a
few
days
princess
mary
and
the
old
prince
each
bore
and
hid
their
grief
in
their
own
way
the
old
prince
would
not
cherish
any
hope
he
made
up
his
mind
that
prince
andrew
had
been
killed
and
though
he
sent
an
official
to
austria
to
seek
for
traces
of
his
son
he
ordered
a
monument
from
moscow
which
he
intended
to
erect
in
his
own
garden
to
his
memory
and
he
told
everybody
that
his
son
had
been
killed
he
tried
not
to
change
his
former
way
of
life
but
his
strength
failed
him
he
walked
less
ate
less
slept
less
and
became
weaker
every
day
princess
mary
hoped
she
prayed
for
her
brother
as
living
and
was
always
awaiting
news
of
his
return
chapter
viii
dearest
said
the
little
princess
after
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
march
and
her
downy
little
lip
rose
from
old
habit
but
as
sorrow
was
manifest
in
every
smile
the
sound
of
every
word
and
even
every
footstep
in
that
house
since
the
terrible
news
had
come
so
now
the
smile
of
the
little
princess
influenced
by
the
general
mood
though
without
knowing
its
cause
was
such
as
to
remind
one
still
more
of
the
general
sorrow
dearest
i
m
afraid
this
morning
s
fruschtique
as
foka
the

said
princess
mary
in
alarm
running
with
her
soft
ponderous
steps
up
to
her
sister
in
law
your
excellency
should
not
mary
bogdanovna
be
sent
for
said
one
of
the
maids
who
was
present
mary
bogdanovna
was
a
midwife
from
the
neighboring
town
who
had
been
at
bald
hills

my

she
kissed
lise
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
oh

and
besides
the
pallor
and
the
physical
suffering
on
the
little
princess
face
an
expression
of
childish
fear
of
inevitable
pain
showed
itself
no
it
s
only
indigestion
say
it
s
only
indigestion
say
so
mary
say
and
the
little
princess
began
to
cry
capriciously
like
a
suffering
child
and
to
wring
her
little
hands
even
with
some
affectation
princess
mary
ran
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
mary
bogdanovna
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
oh
she
heard
as
she
left
the
room
the
midwife
was
already
on
her
way
to
meet
her
rubbing
her
small
plump
white
hands
with
an
air
of
calm
importance
mary
bogdanovna

said
princess
mary
looking
at
the
midwife
with
wide
open
eyes
of
alarm
well
the
lord
be
thanked
princess
said
mary
bogdanovna
not
hastening
her
steps
you
young
ladies
should
not
know
anything
about
it
but
how
is
it
the
doctor
from
moscow

not
here
yet
said
the
princess
in
accordance
with
lise
s
and
prince
andrew
s
wishes
they
had
sent
in
good
time
to
moscow
for
a
doctor
and
were
expecting
him
at
any
moment
no
matter
princess
don
t
be
alarmed
said
mary
bogdanovna
we
ll
manage
very
well
without
a
doctor
five
minutes
later
princess
mary
from
her
room
heard
something
heavy
being
carried
by
she
looked
out
the
men
servants
were
carrying
the
large
leather
sofa
from
prince
andrew
s
study
into
the
bedroom
on
their
faces
was
a
quiet
and
solemn
look
princess
mary
sat
alone
in
her
room
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
house
now
and
then
opening
her
door
when
someone
passed
and
watching
what
was
going
on
in
the
passage
some
women
passing
with
quiet
steps
in
and
out
of
the
bedroom
glanced
at
the
princess
and
turned
away
she
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
and
shut
the
door
again
now
sitting
down
in
her
easy
chair
now
taking
her
prayer
book
now
kneeling
before
the
icon
stand
to
her
surprise
and
distress
she
found
that
her
prayers
did
not
calm
her
excitement
suddenly
her
door
opened
softly
and
her
old
nurse
praskovya
savishna
who
hardly
ever
came
to
that
room
as
the
old
prince
had
forbidden
it
appeared
on
the
threshold
with
a
shawl
round
her
head
i
ve
come
to
sit
with
you
a
bit
masha
said
the
nurse
and
here
i
ve
brought
the
prince
s
wedding
candles
to
light
before
his
saint
my
angel
she
said
with
a
sigh
oh
nurse
i
m
so
glad
god
is
merciful
birdie
the
nurse
lit
the
gilt
candles
before
the
icons
and
sat
down
by
the
door
with
her
knitting
princess
mary
took
a
book
and
began
reading
only
when
footsteps
or
voices
were
heard
did
they
look
at
one
another
the
princess
anxious
and
inquiring
the
nurse
encouraging
everyone
in
the
house
was
dominated
by
the
same
feeling
that
princess
mary
experienced
as
she
sat
in
her
room
but
owing
to
the
superstition
that
the
fewer
the
people
who
know
of
it
the
less
a
woman
in
travail
suffers
everyone
tried
to
pretend
not
to
know
no
one
spoke
of
it
but
apart
from
the
ordinary
staid
and
respectful
good
manners
habitual
in
the
prince
s
household
a
common
anxiety
a
softening
of
the
heart
and
a
consciousness
that
something
great
and
mysterious
was
being
accomplished
at
that
moment
made
itself
felt
there
was
no
laughter
in
the
maids
large
hall
in
the
men
servants
hall
all
sat
waiting
silently
and
alert
in
the
outlying
serfs
quarters
torches
and
candles
were
burning
and
no
one
slept
the
old
prince
stepping
on
his
heels
paced
up
and
down
his
study
and
sent
tikhon
to
ask
mary
bogdanovna
what
news
say
only
that
the
prince
told
me
to
ask
and
come
and
tell
me
her
answer
inform
the
prince
that
labor
has
begun
said
mary
bogdanovna
giving
the
messenger
a
significant
look
tikhon
went
and
told
the
prince
very
good
said
the
prince
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
tikhon
did
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
from
the
study
after
that
after
a
while
he
re
entered
it
as
if
to
snuff
the
candles
and
seeing
the
prince
was
lying
on
the
sofa
looked
at
him
noticed
his
perturbed
face
shook
his
head
and
going
up
to
him
silently
kissed
him
on
the
shoulder
and
left
the
room
without
snuffing
the
candles
or
saying
why
he
had
entered
the
most
solemn
mystery
in
the
world
continued
its
course
evening
passed
night
came
and
the
feeling
of
suspense
and
softening
of
heart
in
the
presence
of
the
unfathomable
did
not
lessen
but
increased
no
one
slept
it
was
one
of
those
march
nights
when
winter
seems
to
wish
to
resume
its
sway
and
scatters
its
last
snows
and
storms
with
desperate
fury
a
relay
of
horses
had
been
sent
up
the
highroad
to
meet
the
german
doctor
from
moscow
who
was
expected
every
moment
and
men
on
horseback
with
lanterns
were
sent
to
the
crossroads
to
guide
him
over
the
country
road
with
its
hollows
and
snow
covered
pools
of
water
princess
mary
had
long
since
put
aside
her
book
she
sat
silent
her
luminous
eyes
fixed
on
her
nurse
s
wrinkled
face
every
line
of
which
she
knew
so
well
on
the
lock
of
gray
hair
that
escaped
from
under
the
kerchief
and
the
loose
skin
that
hung
under
her
chin
nurse
savishna
knitting
in
hand
was
telling
in
low
tones
scarcely
hearing
or
understanding
her
own
words
what
she
had
told
hundreds
of
times
before
how
the
late
princess
had
given
birth
to
princess
mary
in
kishenev
with
only
a
moldavian
peasant
woman
to
help
instead
of
a
midwife
god
is
merciful
doctors
are
never
needed
she
said
suddenly
a
gust
of
wind
beat
violently
against
the
casement
of
the
window
from
which
the
double
frame
had
been
removed
by
order
of
the
prince
one
window
frame
was
removed
in
each
room
as
soon
as
the
larks
returned
and
forcing
open
a
loosely
closed
latch
set
the
damask
curtain
flapping
and
blew
out
the
candle
with
its
chill
snowy
draft
princess
mary
shuddered
her
nurse
putting
down
the
stocking
she
was
knitting
went
to
the
window
and
leaning
out
tried
to
catch
the
open
casement
the
cold
wind
flapped
the
ends
of
her
kerchief
and
her
loose
locks
of
gray
hair
princess
my
dear
there
s
someone
driving
up
the
avenue
she
said
holding
the
casement
and
not
closing
it
with
lanterns
most
likely
the
doctor
oh
my
god
thank
god
said
princess
mary
i
must
go
and
meet
him
he
does
not
know
russian
princess
mary
threw
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
ran
to
meet
the
newcomer
as
she
was
crossing
the
anteroom
she
saw
through
the
window
a
carriage
with
lanterns
standing
at
the
entrance
she
went
out
on
the
stairs
on
a
banister
post
stood
a
tallow
candle
which
guttered
in
the
draft
on
the
landing
below
philip
the
footman
stood
looking
scared
and
holding
another
candle
still
lower
beyond
the
turn
of
the
staircase
one
could
hear
the
footstep
of
someone
in
thick
felt
boots
and
a
voice
that
seemed
familiar
to
princess
mary
was
saying
something
thank
god
said
the
voice
and
father
gone
to
bed
replied
the
voice
of
demyan
the
house
steward
who
was
downstairs
then
the
voice
said
something
more
demyan
replied
and
the
steps
in
the
felt
boots
approached
the
unseen
bend
of
the
staircase
more
rapidly
it
s
andrew
thought
princess
mary
no
it
can
t
be
that
would
be
too
extraordinary
and
at
the
very
moment
she
thought
this
the
face
and
figure
of
prince
andrew
in
a
fur
cloak
the
deep
collar
of
which
covered
with
snow
appeared
on
the
landing
where
the
footman
stood
with
the
candle
yes
it
was
he
pale
thin
with
a
changed
and
strangely
softened
but
agitated
expression
on
his
face
he
came
up
the
stairs
and
embraced
his
sister
you
did
not
get
my
letter
he
asked
and
not
waiting
for
a
reply
which
he
would
not
have
received
for
the
princess
was
unable
to
speak
he
turned
back
rapidly
mounted
the
stairs
again
with
the
doctor
who
had
entered
the
hall
after
him
they
had
met
at
the
last
post
station
and
again
embraced
his
sister
what
a
strange
fate
masha
darling
and
having
taken
off
his
cloak
and
felt
boots
he
went
to
the
little
princess
apartment
chapter
ix
the
little
princess
lay
supported
by
pillows
with
a
white
cap
on
her
head
the
pains
had
just
left
her
strands
of
her
black
hair
lay
round
her
inflamed
and
perspiring
cheeks
her
charming
rosy
mouth
with
its
downy
lip
was
open
and
she
was
smiling
joyfully
prince
andrew
entered
and
paused
facing
her
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
on
which
she
was
lying
her
glittering
eyes
filled
with
childlike
fear
and
excitement
rested
on
him
without
changing
their
expression
i
love
you
all
and
have
done
no
harm
to
anyone
why
must
i
suffer
so
help
me
her
look
seemed
to
say
she
saw
her
husband
but
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
his
appearance
before
her
now
prince
andrew
went
round
the
sofa
and
kissed
her
forehead
my
darling
he
said
a
word
he
had
never
used
to
her
before
god
is
merciful
she
looked
at
him
inquiringly
and
with
childlike
reproach
i
expected
help
from
you
and
i
get
none
none
from
you
either
said
her
eyes
she
was
not
surprised
at
his
having
come
she
did
not
realize
that
he
had
come
his
coming
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
sufferings
or
with
their
relief
the
pangs
began
again
and
mary
bogdanovna
advised
prince
andrew
to
leave
the
room
the
doctor
entered
prince
andrew
went
out
and
meeting
princess
mary
again
joined
her
they
began
talking
in
whispers
but
their
talk
broke
off
at
every
moment
they
waited
and
listened
go
dear
said
princess
mary
prince
andrew
went
again
to
his
wife
and
sat
waiting
in
the
room
next
to
hers
a
woman
came
from
the
bedroom
with
a
frightened
face
and
became
confused
when
she
saw
prince
andrew
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
remained
so
for
some
minutes
piteous
helpless
animal
moans
came
through
the
door
prince
andrew
got
up
went
to
the
door
and
tried
to
open
it
someone
was
holding
it
shut
you
can
t
come
in
you
can
t
said
a
terrified
voice
from
within
he
began
pacing
the
room
the
screaming
ceased
and
a
few
more
seconds
went
by
then
suddenly
a
terrible
shriek
it
could
not
be
hers
she
could
not
scream
like
that
came
from
the
bedroom
prince
andrew
ran
to
the
door
the
scream
ceased
and
he
heard
the
wail
of
an
infant
what
have
they
taken
a
baby
in
there
for
thought
prince
andrew
in
the
first
second
a
baby
what
baby
why
is
there
a
baby
there
or
is
the
baby
born
then
suddenly
he
realized
the
joyful
significance
of
that
wail
tears
choked
him
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
window
sill
he
began
to
cry
sobbing
like
a
child
the
door
opened
the
doctor
with
his
shirt
sleeves
tucked
up
without
a
coat
pale
and
with
a
trembling
jaw
came
out
of
the
room
prince
andrew
turned
to
him
but
the
doctor
gave
him
a
bewildered
look
and
passed
by
without
a
word
a
woman
rushed
out
and
seeing
prince
andrew
stopped
hesitating
on
the
threshold
he
went
into
his
wife
s
room
she
was
lying
dead
in
the
same
position
he
had
seen
her
in
five
minutes
before
and
despite
the
fixed
eyes
and
the
pallor
of
the
cheeks
the
same
expression
was
on
her
charming
childlike
face
with
its
upper
lip
covered
with
tiny
black
hair
i
love
you
all
and
have
done
no
harm
to
anyone
and
what
have
you
done
to
me
said
her
charming
pathetic
dead
face
in
a
corner
of
the
room
something
red
and
tiny
gave
a
grunt
and
squealed
in
mary
bogdanovna
s
trembling
white
hands
two
hours
later
prince
andrew
stepping
softly
went
into
his
father
s
room
the
old
man
already
knew
everything
he
was
standing
close
to
the
door
and
as
soon
as
it
opened
his
rough
old
arms
closed
like
a
vise
round
his
son
s
neck
and
without
a
word
he
began
to
sob
like
a
child
three
days
later
the
little
princess
was
buried
and
prince
andrew
went
up
the
steps
to
where
the
coffin
stood
to
give
her
the
farewell
kiss
and
there
in
the
coffin
was
the
same
face
though
with
closed
eyes
ah
what
have
you
done
to
me
it
still
seemed
to
say
and
prince
andrew
felt
that
something
gave
way
in
his
soul
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
sin
he
could
neither
remedy
nor
forget
he
could
not
weep
the
old
man
too
came
up
and
kissed
the
waxen
little
hands
that
lay
quietly
crossed
one
on
the
other
on
her
breast
and
to
him
too
her
face
seemed
to
say
ah
what
have
you
done
to
me
and
why
and
at
the
sight
the
old
man
turned
angrily
away
another
five
days
passed
and
then
the
young
prince
nicholas
andreevich
was
baptized
the
wet
nurse
supported
the
coverlet
with
her
chin
while
the
priest
with
a
goose
feather
anointed
the
boy
s
little
red
and
wrinkled
soles
and
palms
his
grandfather
who
was
his
godfather
trembling
and
afraid
of
dropping
him
carried
the
infant
round
the
battered
tin
font
and
handed
him
over
to
the
godmother
princess
mary
prince
andrew
sat
in
another
room
faint
with
fear
lest
the
baby
should
be
drowned
in
the
font
and
awaited
the
termination
of
the
ceremony
he
looked
up
joyfully
at
the
baby
when
the
nurse
brought
it
to
him
and
nodded
approval
when
she
told
him
that
the
wax
with
the
baby
s
hair
had
not
sunk
in
the
font
but
had
floated
chapter
x
rostov
s
share
in
dolokhov
s
duel
with
bezukhov
was
hushed
up
by
the
efforts
of
the
old
count
and
instead
of
being
degraded
to
the
ranks
as
he
expected
he
was
appointed
an
adjutant
to
the
governor
general
of
moscow
as
a
result
he
could
not
go
to
the
country
with
the
rest
of
the
family
but
was
kept
all
summer
in
moscow
by
his
new
duties
dolokhov
recovered
and
rostov
became
very
friendly
with
him
during
his
convalescence
dolokhov
lay
ill
at
his
mother
s
who
loved
him
passionately
and
tenderly
and
old
mary
ivanovna
who
had
grown
fond
of
rostov
for
his
friendship
to
her
fedya
often
talked
to
him
about
her
son
yes
count
she
would
say
he
is
too
noble
and
pure
souled
for
our
present
depraved
world
no
one
now
loves
virtue
it
seems
like
a
reproach
to
everyone
now
tell
me
count
was
it
right
was
it
honorable
of
bezukhov
and
fedya
with
his
noble
spirit
loved
him
and
even
now
never
says
a
word
against
him
those
pranks
in
petersburg
when
they
played
some
tricks
on
a
policeman
didn
t
they
do
it
together
and
there
bezukhov
got
off
scotfree
while
fedya
had
to
bear
the
whole
burden
on
his
shoulders
fancy
what
he
had
to
go
through
it
s
true
he
has
been
reinstated
but
how
could
they
fail
to
do
that
i
think
there
were
not
many
such
gallant
sons
of
the
fatherland
out
there
as
he
and
now
this
duel
have
these
people
no
feeling
or
honor
knowing
him
to
be
an
only
son
to
challenge
him
and
shoot
so
straight
it
s
well
god
had
mercy
on
us
and
what
was
it
for
who
doesn
t
have
intrigues
nowadays
why
if
he
was
so
jealous
as
i
see
things
he
should
have
shown
it
sooner
but
he
lets
it
go
on
for
months
and
then
to
call
him
out
reckoning
on
fedya
not
fighting
because
he
owed
him
money
what
baseness
what
meanness
i
know
you
understand
fedya
my
dear
count
that
believe
me
is
why
i
am
so
fond
of
you
few
people
do
understand
him
he
is
such
a
lofty
heavenly
soul
dolokhov
himself
during
his
convalescence
spoke
to
rostov
in
a
way
no
one
would
have
expected
of
him
i
know
people
consider
me
a
bad
man
he
said
let
them
i
don
t
care
a
straw
about
anyone
but
those
i
love
but
those
i
love
i
love
so
that
i
would
give
my
life
for
them
and
the
others
i
d
throttle
if
they
stood
in
my
way
i
have
an
adored
a
priceless
mother
and
two
or
three
friends
you
among
them
and
as
for
the
rest
i
only
care
about
them
in
so
far
as
they
are
harmful
or
useful
and
most
of
them
are
harmful
especially
the
women
yes
dear
boy
he
continued
i
have
met
loving
noble
high
minded
men
but
i
have
not
yet
met
any
women
countesses
or
cooks
who
were
not
venal
i
have
not
yet
met
that
divine
purity
and
devotion
i
look
for
in
women
if
i
found
such
a
one
i
d
give
my
life
for
her
but
those
and
he
made
a
gesture
of
contempt
and
believe
me
if
i
still
value
my
life
it
is
only
because
i
still
hope
to
meet
such
a
divine
creature
who
will
regenerate
purify
and
elevate
me
but
you
don
t
understand
it
oh
yes
i
quite
understand
answered
rostov
who
was
under
his
new
friend
s
influence
in
the
autumn
the
rostovs
returned
to
moscow
early
in
the
winter
denisov
also
came
back
and
stayed
with
them
the
first
half
of
the
winter
of
which
nicholas
rostov
spent
in
moscow
was
one
of
the
happiest
merriest
times
for
him
and
the
whole
family
nicholas
brought
many
young
men
to
his
parents
house
vera
was
a
handsome
girl
of
twenty
sonya
a
girl
of
sixteen
with
all
the
charm
of
an
opening
flower
natasha
half
grown
up
and
half
child
was
now
childishly
amusing
now
girlishly
enchanting
at
that
time
in
the
rostovs
house
there
prevailed
an
amorous
atmosphere
characteristic
of
homes
where
there
are
very
young
and
very
charming
girls
every
young
man
who
came
to
the
house
seeing
those
impressionable
smiling
young
faces
smiling
probably
at
their
own
happiness
feeling
the
eager
bustle
around
him
and
hearing
the
fitful
bursts
of
song
and
music
and
the
inconsequent
but
friendly
prattle
of
young
girls
ready
for
anything
and
full
of
hope
experienced
the
same
feeling
sharing
with
the
young
folk
of
the
rostovs
household
a
readiness
to
fall
in
love
and
an
expectation
of
happiness
among
the
young
men
introduced
by
rostov
one
of
the
first
was
dolokhov
whom
everyone
in
the
house
liked
except
natasha
she
almost
quarreled
with
her
brother
about
him
she
insisted
that
he
was
a
bad
man
and
that
in
the
duel
with
bezukhov
pierre
was
right
and
dolokhov
wrong
and
further
that
he
was
disagreeable
and
unnatural
there
s
nothing
for
me
to
understand
she
cried
out
with
resolute
self
will
he
is
wicked
and
heartless
there
now
i
like
your
denisov
though
he
is
a
rake
and
all
that
still
i
like
him
so
you
see
i
do
understand
i
don
t
know
how
to
put
it
with
this
one
everything
is
calculated
and
i
don
t
like
that
but
denisov
oh
denisov
is
quite
different
replied
nicholas
implying
that
even
denisov
was
nothing
compared
to
dolokhov
you
must
understand
what
a
soul
there
is
in
dolokhov
you
should
see
him
with
his
mother
what
a
heart
well
i
don
t
know
about
that
but
i
am
uncomfortable
with
him
and
do
you
know
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
sonya
what
nonsense
i
m
certain
of
it
you
ll
see
natasha
s
prediction
proved
true
dolokhov
who
did
not
usually
care
for
the
society
of
ladies
began
to
come
often
to
the
house
and
the
question
for
whose
sake
he
came
though
no
one
spoke
of
it
was
soon
settled
he
came
because
of
sonya
and
sonya
though
she
would
never
have
dared
to
say
so
knew
it
and
blushed
scarlet
every
time
dolokhov
appeared
dolokhov
often
dined
at
the
rostovs
never
missed
a
performance
at
which
they
were
present
and
went
to
iogel
s
balls
for
young
people
which
the
rostovs
always
attended
he
was
pointedly
attentive
to
sonya
and
looked
at
her
in
such
a
way
that
not
only
could
she
not
bear
his
glances
without
coloring
but
even
the
old
countess
and
natasha
blushed
when
they
saw
his
looks
it
was
evident
that
this
strange
strong
man
was
under
the
irresistible
influence
of
the
dark
graceful
girl
who
loved
another
rostov
noticed
something
new
in
dolokhov
s
relations
with
sonya
but
he
did
not
explain
to
himself
what
these
new
relations
were
they
re
always
in
love
with
someone
he
thought
of
sonya
and
natasha
but
he
was
not
as
much
at
ease
with
sonya
and
dolokhov
as
before
and
was
less
frequently
at
home
in
the
autumn
of
everybody
had
again
begun
talking
of
the
war
with
napoleon
with
even
greater
warmth
than
the
year
before
orders
were
given
to
raise
recruits
ten
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
regular
army
and
besides
this
nine
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
militia
everywhere
bonaparte
was
anathematized
and
in
moscow
nothing
but
the
coming
war
was
talked
of
for
the
rostov
family
the
whole
interest
of
these
preparations
for
war
lay
in
the
fact
that
nicholas
would
not
hear
of
remaining
in
moscow
and
only
awaited
the
termination
of
denisov
s
furlough
after
christmas
to
return
with
him
to
their
regiment
his
approaching
departure
did
not
prevent
his
amusing
himself
but
rather
gave
zest
to
his
pleasures
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
away
from
home
at
dinners
parties
and
balls
chapter
xi
on
the
third
day
after
christmas
nicholas
dined
at
home
a
thing
he
had
rarely
done
of
late
it
was
a
grand
farewell
dinner
as
he
and
denisov
were
leaving
to
join
their
regiment
after
epiphany
about
twenty
people
were
present
including
dolokhov
and
denisov
never
had
love
been
so
much
in
the
air
and
never
had
the
amorous
atmosphere
made
itself
so
strongly
felt
in
the
rostovs
house
as
at
this
holiday
time
seize
the
moments
of
happiness
love
and
be
loved
that
is
the
only
reality
in
the
world
all
else
is
folly
it
is
the
one
thing
we
are
interested
in
here
said
the
spirit
of
the
place
nicholas
having
as
usual
exhausted
two
pairs
of
horses
without
visiting
all
the
places
he
meant
to
go
to
and
where
he
had
been
invited
returned
home
just
before
dinner
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
noticed
and
felt
the
tension
of
the
amorous
air
in
the
house
and
also
noticed
a
curious
embarrassment
among
some
of
those
present
sonya
dolokhov
and
the
old
countess
were
especially
disturbed
and
to
a
lesser
degree
natasha
nicholas
understood
that
something
must
have
happened
between
sonya
and
dolokhov
before
dinner
and
with
the
kindly
sensitiveness
natural
to
him
was
very
gentle
and
wary
with
them
both
at
dinner
on
that
same
evening
there
was
to
be
one
of
the
balls
that
iogel
the
dancing
master
gave
for
his
pupils
during
the
holidays
nicholas
will
you
come
to
iogel
s
please
do
said
natasha
he
asked
you
and
vasili
dmitrich
is
also
going
denisov
where
would
i
not
go
at
the
countess
command
said
denisov
who
at
the
rostovs
had
jocularly
assumed
the
role
of
natasha
s
knight
i
m
even
weady
to
dance
the
pas
de
chale
if
i
have
time
answered
nicholas
but
i
promised
the
arkharovs
they
have
a
party
and
you
he
asked
dolokhov
but
as
soon
as
he
had
asked
the
question
he
noticed
that
it
should
not
have
been
put
perhaps
coldly
and
angrily
replied
dolokhov
glancing
at
sonya
and
scowling
he
gave
nicholas
just
such
a
look
as
he
had
given
pierre
at
the
club
dinner
there
is
something
up
thought
nicholas
and
he
was
further
confirmed
in
this
conclusion
by
the
fact
that
dolokhov
left
immediately
after
dinner
he
called
natasha
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
and
i
was
looking
for
you
said
natasha
running
out
to
him
i
told
you
but
you
would
not
believe
it
she
said
triumphantly
he
has
proposed
to
sonya
little
as
nicholas
had
occupied
himself
with
sonya
of
late
something
seemed
to
give
way
within
him
at
this
news
dolokhov
was
a
suitable
and
in
some
respects
a
brilliant
match
for
the
dowerless
orphan
girl
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
old
countess
and
of
society
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
her
to
refuse
him
and
therefore
nicholas
first
feeling
on
hearing
the
news
was
one
of
anger
with
sonya
he
tried
to
say
that
s
capital
of
course
she
ll
forget
her
childish
promises
and
accept
the
offer
but
before
he
had
time
to
say
it
natasha
began
again
and
fancy
she
refused
him
quite
definitely
adding
after
a
pause
she
told
him
she
loved
another
yes
my
sonya
could
not
have
done
otherwise
thought
nicholas
much
as
mamma
pressed
her
she
refused
and
i
know
she
won
t
change
once
she
has
said
and
mamma
pressed
her
said
nicholas
reproachfully
yes
said
natasha
do
you
know
nicholas
don
t
be
angry
but
i
know
you
will
not
marry
her
i
know
heaven
knows
how
but
i
know
for
certain
that
you
won
t
marry
her
now
you
don
t
know
that
at
all
said
nicholas
but
i
must
talk
to
her
what
a
darling
sonya
is
he
added
with
a
smile
ah
she
is
indeed
a
darling
i
ll
send
her
to
you
and
natasha
kissed
her
brother
and
ran
away
a
minute
later
sonya
came
in
with
a
frightened
guilty
and
scared
look
nicholas
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
hand
this
was
the
first
time
since
his
return
that
they
had
talked
alone
and
about
their
love
sophie
he
began
timidly
at
first
and
then
more
and
more
boldly
if
you
wish
to
refuse
one
who
is
not
only
a
brilliant
and
advantageous
match
but
a
splendid
noble
fellow
he
is
my
friend
sonya
interrupted
him
i
have
already
refused
she
said
hurriedly
if
you
are
refusing
for
my
sake
i
am
afraid
that
i
sonya
again
interrupted
she
gave
him
an
imploring
frightened
look
nicholas
don
t
tell
me
that
she
said
no
but
i
must
it
may
be
arrogant
of
me
but
still
it
is
best
to
say
it
if
you
refuse
him
on
my
account
i
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
love
you
and
i
think
i
love
you
more
than
anyone
else
that
is
enough
for
me
said
sonya
blushing
no
but
i
have
been
in
love
a
thousand
times
and
shall
fall
in
love
again
though
for
no
one
have
i
such
a
feeling
of
friendship
confidence
and
love
as
i
have
for
you
then
i
am
young
mamma
does
not
wish
it
in
a
word
i
make
no
promise
and
i
beg
you
to
consider
dolokhov
s
offer
he
said
articulating
his
friend
s
name
with
difficulty
don
t
say
that
to
me
i
want
nothing
i
love
you
as

am
afraid
of
misleading

chapter
xii
iogel
s
were
the
most
enjoyable
balls
in
moscow
so
said
the
mothers
as
they
watched
their
young
people
executing
their
newly
learned
steps
and
so
said
the
youths
and
maidens
themselves
as
they
danced
till
they
were
ready
to
drop
and
so
said
the
grown
up
young
men
and
women
who
came
to
these
balls
with
an
air
of
condescension
and
found
them
most
enjoyable
that
year
two
marriages
had
come
of
these
balls
the
two
pretty
young
princesses
gorchakov
met
suitors
there
and
were
married
and
so
further
increased
the
fame
of
these
dances
what
distinguished
them
from
others
was
the
absence
of
host
or
hostess
and
the
presence
of
the
good
natured
iogel
flying
about
like
a
feather
and
bowing
according
to
the
rules
of
his
art
as
he
collected
the
tickets
from
all
his
visitors
there
was
the
fact
that
only
those
came
who
wished
to
dance
and
amuse
themselves
as
girls
of
thirteen
and
fourteen
do
who
are
wearing
long
dresses
for
the
first
time
with
scarcely
any
exceptions
they
all
were
or
seemed
to
be
pretty
so
rapturous
were
their
smiles
and
so
sparkling
their
eyes
sometimes
the
best
of
the
pupils
of
whom
natasha
who
was
exceptionally
graceful
was
first
even
danced
the
pas
de
chale
but
at
this
last
ball
only
the
ecossaise
the
anglaise
and
the
mazurka
which
was
just
coming
into
fashion
were
danced
iogel
had
taken
a
ballroom
in
bezukhov
s
house
and
the
ball
as
everyone
said
was
a
great
success
there
were
many
pretty
girls
and
the
rostov
girls
were
among
the
prettiest
they
were
both
particularly
happy
and
gay
that
evening
proud
of
dolokhov
s
proposal
her
refusal
and
her
explanation
with
nicholas
sonya
twirled
about
before
she
left
home
so
that
the
maid
could
hardly
get
her
hair
plaited
and
she
was
transparently
radiant
with
impulsive
joy
natasha
no
less
proud
of
her
first
long
dress
and
of
being
at
a
real
ball
was
even
happier
they
were
both
dressed
in
white
muslin
with
pink
ribbons
natasha
fell
in
love
the
very
moment
she
entered
the
ballroom
she
was
not
in
love
with
anyone
in
particular
but
with
everyone
whatever
person
she
happened
to
look
at
she
was
in
love
with
for
that
moment
oh
how
delightful
it
is
she
kept
saying
running
up
to
sonya
nicholas
and
denisov
were
walking
up
and
down
looking
with
kindly
patronage
at
the
dancers
how
sweet
she
is
she
will
be
a
weal
beauty
said
denisov
who
countess
natasha
answered
denisov
and
how
she
dances
what
gwace
he
said
again
after
a
pause
who
are
you
talking
about
about
your
sister
ejaculated
denisov
testily
rostov
smiled
my
dear
count
you
were
one
of
my
best
pupils
you
must
dance
said
little
iogel
coming
up
to
nicholas
look
how
many
charming
young
ladies
he
turned
with
the
same
request
to
denisov
who
was
also
a
former
pupil
of
his
no
my
dear
fellow
i
ll
be
a
wallflower
said
denisov
don
t
you
wecollect
what
bad
use
i
made
of
your
lessons
oh
no
said
iogel
hastening
to
reassure
him
you
were
only
inattentive
but
you
had
talent
oh
yes
you
had
talent
the
band
struck
up
the
newly
introduced
mazurka
nicholas
could
not
refuse
iogel
and
asked
sonya
to
dance
denisov
sat
down
by
the
old
ladies
and
leaning
on
his
saber
and
beating
time
with
his
foot
told
them
something
funny
and
kept
them
amused
while
he
watched
the
young
people
dancing
iogel
with
natasha
his
pride
and
his
best
pupil
were
the
first
couple
noiselessly
skillfully
stepping
with
his
little
feet
in
low
shoes
iogel
flew
first
across
the
hall
with
natasha
who
though
shy
went
on
carefully
executing
her
steps
denisov
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
and
beat
time
with
his
saber
in
a
way
that
clearly
indicated
that
if
he
was
not
dancing
it
was
because
he
would
not
and
not
because
he
could
not
in
the
middle
of
a
figure
he
beckoned
to
rostov
who
was
passing
this
is
not
at
all
the
thing
he
said
what
sort
of
polish
mazuwka
is
this
but
she
does
dance
splendidly
knowing
that
denisov
had
a
reputation
even
in
poland
for
the
masterly
way
in
which
he
danced
the
mazurka
nicholas
ran
up
to
natasha
go
and
choose
denisov
he
is
a
real
dancer
a
wonder
he
said
when
it
came
to
natasha
s
turn
to
choose
a
partner
she
rose
and
tripping
rapidly
across
in
her
little
shoes
trimmed
with
bows
ran
timidly
to
the
corner
where
denisov
sat
she
saw
that
everybody
was
looking
at
her
and
waiting
nicholas
saw
that
denisov
was
refusing
though
he
smiled
delightedly
he
ran
up
to
them
please
vasili
dmitrich
natasha
was
saying
do
come
oh
no
let
me
off
countess
denisov
replied
now
then
vaska
said
nicholas
they
coax
me
as
if
i
were
vaska
the
cat
said
denisov
jokingly
i
ll
sing
for
you
a
whole
evening
said
natasha
oh
the
faiwy
she
can
do
anything
with
me
said
denisov
and
he
unhooked
his
saber
he
came
out
from
behind
the
chairs
clasped
his
partner
s
hand
firmly
threw
back
his
head
and
advanced
his
foot
waiting
for
the
beat
only
on
horse
back
and
in
the
mazurka
was
denisov
s
short
stature
not
noticeable
and
he
looked
the
fine
fellow
he
felt
himself
to
be
at
the
right
beat
of
the
music
he
looked
sideways
at
his
partner
with
a
merry
and
triumphant
air
suddenly
stamped
with
one
foot
bounded
from
the
floor
like
a
ball
and
flew
round
the
room
taking
his
partner
with
him
he
glided
silently
on
one
foot
half
across
the
room
and
seeming
not
to
notice
the
chairs
was
dashing
straight
at
them
when
suddenly
clinking
his
spurs
and
spreading
out
his
legs
he
stopped
short
on
his
heels
stood
so
a
second
stamped
on
the
spot
clanking
his
spurs
whirled
rapidly
round
and
striking
his
left
heel
against
his
right
flew
round
again
in
a
circle
natasha
guessed
what
he
meant
to
do
and
abandoning
herself
to
him
followed
his
lead
hardly
knowing
how
first
he
spun
her
round
holding
her
now
with
his
left
now
with
his
right
hand
then
falling
on
one
knee
he
twirled
her
round
him
and
again
jumping
up
dashed
so
impetuously
forward
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
rush
through
the
whole
suite
of
rooms
without
drawing
breath
and
then
he
suddenly
stopped
and
performed
some
new
and
unexpected
steps
when
at
last
smartly
whirling
his
partner
round
in
front
of
her
chair
he
drew
up
with
a
click
of
his
spurs
and
bowed
to
her
natasha
did
not
even
make
him
a
curtsy
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
in
amazement
smiling
as
if
she
did
not
recognize
him
what
does
this
mean
she
brought
out
although
iogel
did
not
acknowledge
this
to
be
the
real
mazurka
everyone
was
delighted
with
denisov
s
skill
he
was
asked
again
and
again
as
a
partner
and
the
old
men
began
smilingly
to
talk
about
poland
and
the
good
old
days
denisov
flushed
after
the
mazurka
and
mopping
himself
with
his
handkerchief
sat
down
by
natasha
and
did
not
leave
her
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
chapter
xiii
for
two
days
after
that
rostov
did
not
see
dolokhov
at
his
own
or
at
dolokhov
s
home
on
the
third
day
he
received
a
note
from
him
as
i
do
not
intend
to
be
at
your
house
again
for
reasons
you
know
of
and
am
going
to
rejoin
my
regiment
i
am
giving
a
farewell
supper
tonight
to
my
friends
come
to
the
english
hotel
about
ten
o
clock
rostov
went
to
the
english
hotel
straight
from
the
theater
where
he
had
been
with
his
family
and
denisov
he
was
at
once
shown
to
the
best
room
which
dolokhov
had
taken
for
that
evening
some
twenty
men
were
gathered
round
a
table
at
which
dolokhov
sat
between
two
candles
on
the
table
was
a
pile
of
gold
and
paper
money
and
he
was
keeping
the
bank
rostov
had
not
seen
him
since
his
proposal
and
sonya
s
refusal
and
felt
uncomfortable
at
the
thought
of
how
they
would
meet
dolokhov
s
clear
cold
glance
met
rostov
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
door
as
though
he
had
long
expected
him
it
s
a
long
time
since
we
met
he
said
thanks
for
coming
i
ll
just
finish
dealing
and
then
ilyushka
will
come
with
his
chorus
i
called
once
or
twice
at
your
house
said
rostov
reddening
dolokhov
made
no
reply
you
may
punt
he
said
rostov
recalled
at
that
moment
a
strange
conversation
he
had
once
had
with
dolokhov
none
but
fools
trust
to
luck
in
play
dolokhov
had
then
said
or
are
you
afraid
to
play
with
me
dolokhov
now
asked
as
if
guessing
rostov
s
thought
beneath
his
smile
rostov
saw
in
him
the
mood
he
had
shown
at
the
club
dinner
and
at
other
times
when
as
if
tired
of
everyday
life
he
had
felt
a
need
to
escape
from
it
by
some
strange
and
usually
cruel
action
rostov
felt
ill
at
ease
he
tried
but
failed
to
find
some
joke
with
which
to
reply
to
dolokhov
s
words
but
before
he
had
thought
of
anything
dolokhov
looking
straight
in
his
face
said
slowly
and
deliberately
so
that
everyone
could
hear
do
you
remember
we
had
a
talk
about
cards
he
s
a
fool
who
trusts
to
luck
one
should
make
certain
and
i
want
to
try
to
try
his
luck
or
the
certainty
rostov
asked
himself
well
you
d
better
not
play
dolokhov
added
and
springing
a
new
pack
of
cards
said
bank
gentlemen
moving
the
money
forward
he
prepared
to
deal
rostov
sat
down
by
his
side
and
at
first
did
not
play
dolokhov
kept
glancing
at
him
why
don
t
you
play
he
asked
and
strange
to
say
nicholas
felt
that
he
could
not
help
taking
up
a
card
putting
a
small
stake
on
it
and
beginning
to
play
i
have
no
money
with
me
he
said
i
ll
trust
you
rostov
staked
five
rubles
on
a
card
and
lost
staked
again
and
again
lost
dolokhov
killed
that
is
beat
ten
cards
of
rostov
s
running
gentlemen
said
dolokhov
after
he
had
dealt
for
some
time
please
place
your
money
on
the
cards
or
i
may
get
muddled
in
the
reckoning
one
of
the
players
said
he
hoped
he
might
be
trusted
yes
you
might
but
i
am
afraid
of
getting
the
accounts
mixed
so
i
ask
you
to
put
the
money
on
your
cards
replied
dolokhov
don
t
stint
yourself
we
ll
settle
afterwards
he
added
turning
to
rostov
the
game
continued
a
waiter
kept
handing
round
champagne
all
rostov
s
cards
were
beaten
and
he
had
eight
hundred
rubles
scored
up
against
him
he
wrote
rubles
on
a
card
but
while
the
waiter
filled
his
glass
he
changed
his
mind
and
altered
it
to
his
usual
stake
of
twenty
rubles
leave
it
said
dolokhov
though
he
did
not
seem
to
be
even
looking
at
rostov
you
ll
win
it
back
all
the
sooner
i
lose
to
the
others
but
win
from
you
or
are
you
afraid
of
me
he
asked
again
rostov
submitted
he
let
the
eight
hundred
remain
and
laid
down
a
seven
of
hearts
with
a
torn
corner
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
he
well
remembered
that
seven
afterwards
he
laid
down
the
seven
of
hearts
on
which
with
a
broken
bit
of
chalk
he
had
written
rubles
in
clear
upright
figures
he
emptied
the
glass
of
warm
champagne
that
was
handed
him
smiled
at
dolokhov
s
words
and
with
a
sinking
heart
waiting
for
a
seven
to
turn
up
gazed
at
dolokhov
s
hands
which
held
the
pack
much
depended
on
rostov
s
winning
or
losing
on
that
seven
of
hearts
on
the
previous
sunday
the
old
count
had
given
his
son
two
thousand
rubles
and
though
he
always
disliked
speaking
of
money
difficulties
had
told
nicholas
that
this
was
all
he
could
let
him
have
till
may
and
asked
him
to
be
more
economical
this
time
nicholas
had
replied
that
it
would
be
more
than
enough
for
him
and
that
he
gave
his
word
of
honor
not
to
take
anything
more
till
the
spring
now
only
twelve
hundred
rubles
was
left
of
that
money
so
that
this
seven
of
hearts
meant
for
him
not
only
the
loss
of
sixteen
hundred
rubles
but
the
necessity
of
going
back
on
his
word
with
a
sinking
heart
he
watched
dolokhov
s
hands
and
thought
now
then
make
haste
and
let
me
have
this
card
and
i
ll
take
my
cap
and
drive
home
to
supper
with
denisov
natasha
and
sonya
and
will
certainly
never
touch
a
card
again
at
that
moment
his
home
life
jokes
with
petya
talks
with
sonya
duets
with
natasha
piquet
with
his
father
and
even
his
comfortable
bed
in
the
house
on
the
povarskaya
rose
before
him
with
such
vividness
clearness
and
charm
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
all
a
lost
and
unappreciated
bliss
long
past
he
could
not
conceive
that
a
stupid
chance
letting
the
seven
be
dealt
to
the
right
rather
than
to
the
left
might
deprive
him
of
all
this
happiness
newly
appreciated
and
newly
illumined
and
plunge
him
into
the
depths
of
unknown
and
undefined
misery
that
could
not
be
yet
he
awaited
with
a
sinking
heart
the
movement
of
dolokhov
s
hands
those
broad
reddish
hands
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
cuffs
laid
down
the
pack
and
took
up
a
glass
and
a
pipe
that
were
handed
him
so
you
are
not
afraid
to
play
with
me
repeated
dolokhov
and
as
if
about
to
tell
a
good
story
he
put
down
the
cards
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
began
deliberately
with
a
smile
yes
gentlemen
i
ve
been
told
there
s
a
rumor
going
about
moscow
that
i
m
a
sharper
so
i
advise
you
to
be
careful
come
now
deal
exclaimed
rostov
oh
those
moscow
gossips
said
dolokhov
and
he
took
up
the
cards
with
a
smile
aah
rostov
almost
screamed
lifting
both
hands
to
his
head
the
seven
he
needed
was
lying
uppermost
the
first
card
in
the
pack
he
had
lost
more
than
he
could
pay
still
don
t
ruin
yourself
said
dolokhov
with
a
side
glance
at
rostov
as
he
continued
to
deal
chapter
xiv
an
hour
and
a
half
later
most
of
the
players
were
but
little
interested
in
their
own
play
the
whole
interest
was
concentrated
on
rostov
instead
of
sixteen
hundred
rubles
he
had
a
long
column
of
figures
scored
against
him
which
he
had
reckoned
up
to
ten
thousand
but
that
now
as
he
vaguely
supposed
must
have
risen
to
fifteen
thousand
in
reality
it
already
exceeded
twenty
thousand
rubles
dolokhov
was
no
longer
listening
to
stories
or
telling
them
but
followed
every
movement
of
rostov
s
hands
and
occasionally
ran
his
eyes
over
the
score
against
him
he
had
decided
to
play
until
that
score
reached
forty
three
thousand
he
had
fixed
on
that
number
because
forty
three
was
the
sum
of
his
and
sonya
s
joint
ages
rostov
leaning
his
head
on
both
hands
sat
at
the
table
which
was
scrawled
over
with
figures
wet
with
spilled
wine
and
littered
with
cards
one
tormenting
impression
did
not
leave
him
that
those
broad
boned
reddish
hands
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
sleeves
those
hands
which
he
loved
and
hated
held
him
in
their
power
six
hundred
rubles
ace
a
corner
a
nine
winning
it
back
s
impossible
oh
how
pleasant
it
was
at
home
the
knave
double
or
quits
it
can
t
be
and
why
is
he
doing
this
to
me
rostov
pondered
sometimes
he
staked
a
large
sum
but
dolokhov
refused
to
accept
it
and
fixed
the
stake
himself
nicholas
submitted
to
him
and
at
one
moment
prayed
to
god
as
he
had
done
on
the
battlefield
at
the
bridge
over
the
enns
and
then
guessed
that
the
card
that
came
first
to
hand
from
the
crumpled
heap
under
the
table
would
save
him
now
counted
the
cords
on
his
coat
and
took
a
card
with
that
number
and
tried
staking
the
total
of
his
losses
on
it
then
he
looked
round
for
aid
from
the
other
players
or
peered
at
the
now
cold
face
of
dolokhov
and
tried
to
read
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
he
knows
of
course
what
this
loss
means
to
me
he
can
t
want
my
ruin
wasn
t
he
my
friend
wasn
t
i
fond
of
him
but
it
s
not
his
fault
what
s
he
to
do
if
he
has
such
luck
and
it
s
not
my
fault
either
he
thought
to
himself
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
have
i
killed
anyone
or
insulted
or
wished
harm
to
anyone
why
such
a
terrible
misfortune
and
when
did
it
begin
such
a
little
while
ago
i
came
to
this
table
with
the
thought
of
winning
a
hundred
rubles
to
buy
that
casket
for
mamma
s
name
day
and
then
going
home
i
was
so
happy
so
free
so
lighthearted
and
i
did
not
realize
how
happy
i
was
when
did
that
end
and
when
did
this
new
terrible
state
of
things
begin
what
marked
the
change
i
sat
all
the
time
in
this
same
place
at
this
table
chose
and
placed
cards
and
watched
those
broad
boned
agile
hands
in
the
same
way
when
did
it
happen
and
what
has
happened
i
am
well
and
strong
and
still
the
same
and
in
the
same
place
no
it
can
t
be
surely
it
will
all
end
in
nothing
he
was
flushed
and
bathed
in
perspiration
though
the
room
was
not
hot
his
face
was
terrible
and
piteous
to
see
especially
from
its
helpless
efforts
to
seem
calm
the
score
against
him
reached
the
fateful
sum
of
forty
three
thousand
rostov
had
just
prepared
a
card
by
bending
the
corner
of
which
he
meant
to
double
the
three
thousand
just
put
down
to
his
score
when
dolokhov
slamming
down
the
pack
of
cards
put
it
aside
and
began
rapidly
adding
up
the
total
of
rostov
s
debt
breaking
the
chalk
as
he
marked
the
figures
in
his
clear
bold
hand
supper
it
s
time
for
supper
and
here
are
the
gypsies
some
swarthy
men
and
women
were
really
entering
from
the
cold
outside
and
saying
something
in
their
gypsy
accents
nicholas
understood
that
it
was
all
over
but
he
said
in
an
indifferent
tone
well
won
t
you
go
on
i
had
a
splendid
card
all
ready
as
if
it
were
the
fun
of
the
game
which
interested
him
most
it
s
all
up
i
m
lost
thought
he
now
a
bullet
through
my
brain
that
s
all
that
s
left
me
and
at
the
same
time
he
said
in
a
cheerful
voice
come
now
just
this
one
more
little
card
all
right
said
dolokhov
having
finished
the
addition
all
right
twenty
one
rubles
he
said
pointing
to
the
figure
twenty
one
by
which
the
total
exceeded
the
round
sum
of
forty
three
thousand
and
taking
up
a
pack
he
prepared
to
deal
rostov
submissively
unbent
the
corner
of
his
card
and
instead
of
the
six
thousand
he
had
intended
carefully
wrote
twenty
one
it
s
all
the
same
to
me
he
said
i
only
want
to
see
whether
you
will
let
me
win
this
ten
or
beat
it
dolokhov
began
to
deal
seriously
oh
how
rostov
detested
at
that
moment
those
hands
with
their
short
reddish
fingers
and
hairy
wrists
which
held
him
in
their
power
the
ten
fell
to
him
you
owe
forty
three
thousand
count
said
dolokhov
and
stretching
himself
he
rose
from
the
table
one
does
get
tired
sitting
so
long
he
added
yes
i
m
tired
too
said
rostov
dolokhov
cut
him
short
as
if
to
remind
him
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
jest
when
am
i
to
receive
the
money
count
rostov
flushing
drew
dolokhov
into
the
next
room
i
cannot
pay
it
all
immediately
will
you
take
an
i
o
u
he
said
i
say
rostov
said
dolokhov
clearly
smiling
and
looking
nicholas
straight
in
the
eyes
you
know
the
saying
lucky
in
love
unlucky
at
cards
your
cousin
is
in
love
with
you
i
know
oh
it
s
terrible
to
feel
oneself
so
in
this
man
s
power
thought
rostov
he
knew
what
a
shock
he
would
inflict
on
his
father
and
mother
by
the
news
of
this
loss
he
knew
what
a
relief
it
would
be
to
escape
it
all
and
felt
that
dolokhov
knew
that
he
could
save
him
from
all
this
shame
and
sorrow
but
wanted
now
to
play
with
him
as
a
cat
does
with
a
mouse
your
cousin
dolokhov
started
to
say
but
nicholas
interrupted
him
my
cousin
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
and
it
s
not
necessary
to
mention
her
he
exclaimed
fiercely
then
when
am
i
to
have
it
tomorrow
replied
rostov
and
left
the
room
chapter
xv
to
say
tomorrow
and
keep
up
a
dignified
tone
was
not
difficult
but
to
go
home
alone
see
his
sisters
brother
mother
and
father
confess
and
ask
for
money
he
had
no
right
to
after
giving
his
word
of
honor
was
terrible
at
home
they
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
the
young
people
after
returning
from
the
theater
had
had
supper
and
were
grouped
round
the
clavichord
as
soon
as
nicholas
entered
he
was
enfolded
in
that
poetic
atmosphere
of
love
which
pervaded
the
rostov
household
that
winter
and
now
after
dolokhov
s
proposal
and
iogel
s
ball
seemed
to
have
grown
thicker
round
sonya
and
natasha
as
the
air
does
before
a
thunderstorm
sonya
and
natasha
in
the
light
blue
dresses
they
had
worn
at
the
theater
looking
pretty
and
conscious
of
it
were
standing
by
the
clavichord
happy
and
smiling
vera
was
playing
chess
with
shinshin
in
the
drawing
room
the
old
countess
waiting
for
the
return
of
her
husband
and
son
sat
playing
patience
with
the
old
gentlewoman
who
lived
in
their
house
denisov
with
sparkling
eyes
and
ruffled
hair
sat
at
the
clavichord
striking
chords
with
his
short
fingers
his
legs
thrown
back
and
his
eyes
rolling
as
he
sang
with
his
small
husky
but
true
voice
some
verses
called
enchantress
which
he
had
composed
and
to
which
he
was
trying
to
fit
music
enchantress
say
to
my
forsaken
lyre
what
magic
power
is
this
recalls
me
still
what
spark
has
set
my
inmost
soul
on
fire
what
is
this
bliss
that
makes
my
fingers
thrill
he
was
singing
in
passionate
tones
gazing
with
his
sparkling
black
agate
eyes
at
the
frightened
and
happy
natasha
splendid
excellent
exclaimed
natasha
another
verse
she
said
without
noticing
nicholas
everything
s
still
the
same
with
them
thought
nicholas
glancing
into
the
drawing
room
where
he
saw
vera
and
his
mother
with
the
old
lady
ah
and
here
s
nicholas
cried
natasha
running
up
to
him
is
papa
at
home
he
asked
i
am
so
glad
you
ve
come
said
natasha
without
answering
him
we
are
enjoying
ourselves
vasili
dmitrich
is
staying
a
day
longer
for
my
sake
did
you
know
no
papa
is
not
back
yet
said
sonya
nicholas
have
you
come
come
here
dear
called
the
old
countess
from
the
drawing
room
nicholas
went
to
her
kissed
her
hand
and
sitting
down
silently
at
her
table
began
to
watch
her
hands
arranging
the
cards
from
the
dancing
room
they
still
heard
the
laughter
and
merry
voices
trying
to
persuade
natasha
to
sing
all
wight
all
wight
shouted
denisov
it
s
no
good
making
excuses
now
it
s
your
turn
to
sing
the
ba
cawolla
i
entweat
you
the
countess
glanced
at
her
silent
son
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
oh
nothing
said
he
as
if
weary
of
being
continually
asked
the
same
question
will
papa
be
back
soon
i
expect
so
everything
s
the
same
with
them
they
know
nothing
about
it
where
am
i
to
go
thought
nicholas
and
went
again
into
the
dancing
room
where
the
clavichord
stood
sonya
was
sitting
at
the
clavichord
playing
the
prelude
to
denisov
s
favorite
barcarolle
natasha
was
preparing
to
sing
denisov
was
looking
at
her
with
enraptured
eyes
nicholas
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
why
do
they
want
to
make
her
sing
how
can
she
sing
there
s
nothing
to
be
happy
about
thought
he
sonya
struck
the
first
chord
of
the
prelude
my
god
i
m
a
ruined
and
dishonored
man
a
bullet
through
my
brain
is
the
only
thing
left
me
not
singing
his
thoughts
ran
on
go
away
but
where
to
it
s
one
let
them
sing
he
continued
to
pace
the
room
looking
gloomily
at
denisov
and
the
girls
and
avoiding
their
eyes
nikolenka
what
is
the
matter
sonya
s
eyes
fixed
on
him
seemed
to
ask
she
noticed
at
once
that
something
had
happened
to
him
nicholas
turned
away
from
her
natasha
too
with
her
quick
instinct
had
instantly
noticed
her
brother
s
condition
but
though
she
noticed
it
she
was
herself
in
such
high
spirits
at
that
moment
so
far
from
sorrow
sadness
or
self
reproach
that
she
purposely
deceived
herself
as
young
people
often
do
no
i
am
too
happy
now
to
spoil
my
enjoyment
by
sympathy
with
anyone
s
sorrow
she
felt
and
she
said
to
herself
no
i
must
be
mistaken
he
must
be
feeling
happy
just
as
i
am
now
sonya
she
said
going
to
the
very
middle
of
the
room
where
she
considered
the
resonance
was
best
having
lifted
her
head
and
let
her
arms
droop
lifelessly
as
ballet
dancers
do
natasha
rising
energetically
from
her
heels
to
her
toes
stepped
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
still
yes
that
s
me
she
seemed
to
say
answering
the
rapt
gaze
with
which
denisov
followed
her
and
what
is
she
so
pleased
about
thought
nicholas
looking
at
his
sister
why
isn
t
she
dull
and
ashamed
natasha
took
the
first
note
her
throat
swelled
her
chest
rose
her
eyes
became
serious
at
that
moment
she
was
oblivious
of
her
surroundings
and
from
her
smiling
lips
flowed
sounds
which
anyone
may
produce
at
the
same
intervals
and
hold
for
the
same
time
but
which
leave
you
cold
a
thousand
times
and
the
thousand
and
first
time
thrill
you
and
make
you
weep
natasha
that
winter
had
for
the
first
time
begun
to
sing
seriously
mainly
because
denisov
so
delighted
in
her
singing
she
no
longer
sang
as
a
child
there
was
no
longer
in
her
singing
that
comical
childish
painstaking
effect
that
had
been
in
it
before
but
she
did
not
yet
sing
well
as
all
the
connoisseurs
who
heard
her
said
it
is
not
trained
but
it
is
a
beautiful
voice
that
must
be
trained
only
they
generally
said
this
some
time
after
she
had
finished
singing
while
that
untrained
voice
with
its
incorrect
breathing
and
labored
transitions
was
sounding
even
the
connoisseurs
said
nothing
but
only
delighted
in
it
and
wished
to
hear
it
again
in
her
voice
there
was
a
virginal
freshness
an
unconsciousness
of
her
own
powers
and
an
as
yet
untrained
velvety
softness
which
so
mingled
with
her
lack
of
art
in
singing
that
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
in
that
voice
could
be
altered
without
spoiling
it
what
is
this
thought
nicholas
listening
to
her
with
widely
opened
eyes
what
has
happened
to
her
how
she
is
singing
today
and
suddenly
the
whole
world
centered
for
him
on
anticipation
of
the
next
note
the
next
phrase
and
everything
in
the
world
was
divided
into
three
beats
oh
mio
crudele
affetto
one
two
three
one
two
three
one
oh
mio
crudele
affetto
one
two
three
one
oh
this
senseless
life
of
ours
thought
nicholas
all
this
misery
and
money
and
dolokhov
and
anger
and
honor
it
s
all
nonsense
but
this
is
real
now
then
natasha
now
then
dearest
now
then
darling
how
will
she
take
that
si
she
s
taken
it
thank
god
and
without
noticing
that
he
was
singing
to
strengthen
the
si
he
sung
a
second
a
third
below
the
high
note
ah
god
how
fine
did
i
really
take
it
how
fortunate
he
thought
oh
how
that
chord
vibrated
and
how
moved
was
something
that
was
finest
in
rostov
s
soul
and
this
something
was
apart
from
everything
else
in
the
world
and
above
everything
in
the
world
what
were
losses
and
dolokhov
and
words
of
honor
all
nonsense
one
might
kill
and
rob
and
yet
be
happy
chapter
xvi
it
was
long
since
rostov
had
felt
such
enjoyment
from
music
as
he
did
that
day
but
no
sooner
had
natasha
finished
her
barcarolle
than
reality
again
presented
itself
he
got
up
without
saying
a
word
and
went
downstairs
to
his
own
room
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
old
count
came
in
from
his
club
cheerful
and
contented
nicholas
hearing
him
drive
up
went
to
meet
him
well
had
a
good
time
said
the
old
count
smiling
gaily
and
proudly
at
his
son
nicholas
tried
to
say
yes
but
could
not
and
he
nearly
burst
into
sobs
the
count
was
lighting
his
pipe
and
did
not
notice
his
son
s
condition
ah
it
can
t
be
avoided
thought
nicholas
for
the
first
and
last
time
and
suddenly
in
the
most
casual
tone
which
made
him
feel
ashamed
of
himself
he
said
as
if
merely
asking
his
father
to
let
him
have
the
carriage
to
drive
to
town
papa
i
have
come
on
a
matter
of
business
i
was
nearly
forgetting
i
need
some
money
dear
me
said
his
father
who
was
in
a
specially
good
humor
i
told
you
it
would
not
be
enough
how
much
very
much
said
nicholas
flushing
and
with
a
stupid
careless
smile
for
which
he
was
long
unable
to
forgive
himself
i
have
lost
a
little
i
mean
a
good
deal
a
great
deal
forty
three
thousand
what
to
whom
nonsense
cried
the
count
suddenly
reddening
with
an
apoplectic
flush
over
neck
and
nape
as
old
people
do
i
promised
to
pay
tomorrow
said
nicholas
well
said
the
old
count
spreading
out
his
arms
and
sinking
helplessly
on
the
sofa
it
can
t
be
helped
it
happens
to
everyone
said
the
son
with
a
bold
free
and
easy
tone
while
in
his
soul
he
regarded
himself
as
a
worthless
scoundrel
whose
whole
life
could
not
atone
for
his
crime
he
longed
to
kiss
his
father
s
hands
and
kneel
to
beg
his
forgiveness
but
said
in
a
careless
and
even
rude
voice
that
it
happens
to
everyone
the
old
count
cast
down
his
eyes
on
hearing
his
son
s
words
and
began
bustlingly
searching
for
something
yes
yes
he
muttered
it
will
be
difficult
i
fear
difficult
to
raise
happens
to
everybody
yes
who
has
not
done
it
and
with
a
furtive
glance
at
his
son
s
face
the
count
went
out
of
the
room
nicholas
had
been
prepared
for
resistance
but
had
not
at
all
expected
this
papa
pa
pa
he
called
after
him
sobbing
forgive
me
and
seizing
his
father
s
hand
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
burst
into
tears
while
father
and
son
were
having
their
explanation
the
mother
and
daughter
were
having
one
not
less
important
natasha
came
running
to
her
mother
quite
excited
mamma
mamma
he
has
made
me
made
what
made
made

indignantly

countess
shrugged
her
shoulders
if

is

that

made
you
a
proposal

him
he
is
a

seriously

smiling

well

said
natasha
with
a
responsive
smile
you

seen

sharply
and
sarcastically

i

so
sorry
for

i
don

know
how
i
m
to
say

and
there

nothing
for
you

say
i
shall
speak

said
the
countess
indignant
that
they
should
have
dared
to
treat
this
little
natasha
as
grown
up
no
not
on
any
account
i
will
tell
him
myself
and
you
ll
listen
at
the
door
and
natasha
ran
across
the
drawing
room
to
the
dancing
hall
where
denisov
was
sitting
on
the
same
chair
by
the
clavichord
with
his
face
in
his
hands
he
jumped
up
at
the
sound
of
her
light
step
nataly
he
said
moving
with
rapid
steps
toward
her
decide
my
fate
it
is
in
your
hands
vasili
dmitrich
i
m
so
sorry
for
you
no
but
you
are
so
nice
but
it
won
t
do
not
that
but
as
a
friend
i
shall
always
love
you
denisov
bent
over
her
hand
and
she
heard
strange
sounds
she
did
not
understand
she
kissed
his
rough
curly
black
head
at
this
instant
they
heard
the
quick
rustle
of
the
countess
dress
she
came
up
to
them
vasili
dmitrich
i
thank
you
for
the
honor
she
said
with
an
embarrassed
voice
though
it
sounded
severe
to
denisov
but
my
daughter
is
so
young
and
i
thought
that
as
my
son
s
friend
you
would
have
addressed
yourself
first
to
me
in
that
case
you
would
not
have
obliged
me
to
give
this
refusal
countess
said
denisov
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
guilty
face
he
tried
to
say
more
but
faltered
natasha
could
not
remain
calm
seeing
him
in
such
a
plight
she
began
to
sob
aloud
countess
i
have
done
w
ong
denisov
went
on
in
an
unsteady
voice
but
believe
me
i
so
adore
your
daughter
and
all
your
family
that
i
would
give
my
life
twice
over
he
looked
at
the
countess
and
seeing
her
severe
face
said
well
good
by
countess
and
kissing
her
hand
he
left
the
room
with
quick
resolute
strides
without
looking
at
natasha
next
day
rostov
saw
denisov
off
he
did
not
wish
to
stay
another
day
in
moscow
all
denisov
s
moscow
friends
gave
him
a
farewell
entertainment
at
the
gypsies
with
the
result
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
how
he
was
put
in
the
sleigh
or
of
the
first
three
stages
of
his
journey
after
denisov
s
departure
rostov
spent
another
fortnight
in
moscow
without
going
out
of
the
house
waiting
for
the
money
his
father
could
not
at
once
raise
and
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
girls
room
sonya
was
more
tender
and
devoted
to
him
than
ever
it
was
as
if
she
wanted
to
show
him
that
his
losses
were
an
achievement
that
made
her
love
him
all
the
more
but
nicholas
now
considered
himself
unworthy
of
her
he
filled
the
girls
albums
with
verses
and
music
and
having
at
last
sent
dolokhov
the
whole
forty
three
thousand
rubles
and
received
his
receipt
he
left
at
the
end
of
november
without
taking
leave
of
any
of
his
acquaintances
to
overtake
his
regiment
which
was
already
in
poland
book
five
chapter
i
after
his
interview
with
his
wife
pierre
left
for
petersburg
at
the
torzhok
post
station
either
there
were
no
horses
or
the
postmaster
would
not
supply
them
pierre
was
obliged
to
wait
without
undressing
he
lay
down
on
the
leather
sofa
in
front
of
a
round
table
put
his
big
feet
in
their
overboots
on
the
table
and
began
to
reflect
will
you
have
the
portmanteaus
brought
in
and
a
bed
got
ready
and
tea
asked
his
valet
pierre
gave
no
answer
for
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
he
had
begun
to
think
of
the
last
station
and
was
still
pondering
on
the
same
question
one
so
important
that
he
took
no
notice
of
what
went
on
around
him
not
only
was
he
indifferent
as
to
whether
he
got
to
petersburg
earlier
or
later
or
whether
he
secured
accommodation
at
this
station
but
compared
to
the
thoughts
that
now
occupied
him
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
he
remained
there
for
a
few
hours
or
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
postmaster
his
wife
the
valet
and
a
peasant
woman
selling
torzhok
embroidery
came
into
the
room
offering
their
services
without
changing
his
careless
attitude
pierre
looked
at
them
over
his
spectacles
unable
to
understand
what
they
wanted
or
how
they
could
go
on
living
without
having
solved
the
problems
that
so
absorbed
him
he
had
been
engrossed
by
the
same
thoughts
ever
since
the
day
he
returned
from
sokolniki
after
the
duel
and
had
spent
that
first
agonizing
sleepless
night
but
now
in
the
solitude
of
the
journey
they
seized
him
with
special
force
no
matter
what
he
thought
about
he
always
returned
to
these
same
questions
which
he
could
not
solve
and
yet
could
not
cease
to
ask
himself
it
was
as
if
the
thread
of
the
chief
screw
which
held
his
life
together
were
stripped
so
that
the
screw
could
not
get
in
or
out
but
went
on
turning
uselessly
in
the
same
place
the
postmaster
came
in
and
began
obsequiously
to
beg
his
excellency
to
wait
only
two
hours
when
come
what
might
he
would
let
his
excellency
have
the
courier
horses
it
was
plain
that
he
was
lying
and
only
wanted
to
get
more
money
from
the
traveler
is
this
good
or
bad
pierre
asked
himself
it
is
good
for
me
bad
for
another
traveler
and
for
himself
it
s
unavoidable
because
he
needs
money
for
food
the
man
said
an
officer
had
once
given
him
a
thrashing
for
letting
a
private
traveler
have
the
courier
horses
but
the
officer
thrashed
him
because
he
had
to
get
on
as
quickly
as
possible
and
i
continued
pierre
shot
dolokhov
because
i
considered
myself
injured
and
louis
xvi
was
executed
because
they
considered
him
a
criminal
and
a
year
later
they
executed
those
who
executed
him
also
for
some
reason
what
is
bad
what
is
good
what
should
one
love
and
what
hate
what
does
one
live
for
and
what
am
i
what
is
life
and
what
is
death
what
power
governs
all
there
was
no
answer
to
any
of
these
questions
except
one
and
that
not
a
logical
answer
and
not
at
all
a
reply
to
them
the
answer
was
you
ll
die
and
all
will
end
you
ll
die
and
know
all
or
cease
asking
but
dying
was
also
dreadful
the
torzhok
peddler
woman
in
a
whining
voice
went
on
offering
her
wares
especially
a
pair
of
goatskin
slippers
i
have
hundreds
of
rubles
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
and
she
stands
in
her
tattered
cloak
looking
timidly
at
me
he
thought
and
what
does
she
want
the
money
for
as
if
that
money
could
add
a
hair
s
breadth
to
happiness
or
peace
of
mind
can
anything
in
the
world
make
her
or
me
less
a
prey
to
evil
and
death
death
which
ends
all
and
must
come
today
or
tomorrow
at
any
rate
in
an
instant
as
compared
with
eternity
and
again
he
twisted
the
screw
with
the
stripped
thread
and
again
it
turned
uselessly
in
the
same
place
his
servant
handed
him
a
half
cut
novel
in
the
form
of
letters
by
madame
de
souza
he
began
reading
about
the
sufferings
and
virtuous
struggles
of
a
certain
emilie
de
mansfeld
and
why
did
she
resist
her
seducer
when
she
loved
him
he
thought
god
could
not
have
put
into
her
heart
an
impulse
that
was
against
his
will
my
wife
as
she
once
was
did
not
struggle
and
perhaps
she
was
right
nothing
has
been
found
out
nothing
discovered
pierre
again
said
to
himself
all
we
can
know
is
that
we
know
nothing
and
that
s
the
height
of
human
wisdom
everything
within
and
around
him
seemed
confused
senseless
and
repellent
yet
in
this
very
repugnance
to
all
his
circumstances
pierre
found
a
kind
of
tantalizing
satisfaction
i
make
bold
to
ask
your
excellency
to
move
a
little
for
this
gentleman
said
the
postmaster
entering
the
room
followed
by
another
traveler
also
detained
for
lack
of
horses
the
newcomer
was
a
short
large
boned
yellow
faced
wrinkled
old
man
with
gray
bushy
eyebrows
overhanging
bright
eyes
of
an
indefinite
grayish
color
pierre
took
his
feet
off
the
table
stood
up
and
lay
down
on
a
bed
that
had
been
got
ready
for
him
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
newcomer
who
with
a
gloomy
and
tired
face
was
wearily
taking
off
his
wraps
with
the
aid
of
his
servant
and
not
looking
at
pierre
with
a
pair
of
felt
boots
on
his
thin
bony
legs
and
keeping
on
a
worn
nankeen
covered
sheepskin
coat
the
traveler
sat
down
on
the
sofa
leaned
back
his
big
head
with
its
broad
temples
and
close
cropped
hair
and
looked
at
bezukhov
the
stern
shrewd
and
penetrating
expression
of
that
look
struck
pierre
he
felt
a
wish
to
speak
to
the
stranger
but
by
the
time
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
him
a
question
about
the
roads
the
traveler
had
closed
his
eyes
his
shriveled
old
hands
were
folded
and
on
the
finger
of
one
of
them
pierre
noticed
a
large
cast
iron
ring
with
a
seal
representing
a
death
s
head
the
stranger
sat
without
stirring
either
resting
or
as
it
seemed
to
pierre
sunk
in
profound
and
calm
meditation
his
servant
was
also
a
yellow
wrinkled
old
man
without
beard
or
mustache
evidently
not
because
he
was
shaven
but
because
they
had
never
grown
this
active
old
servant
was
unpacking
the
traveler
s
canteen
and
preparing
tea
he
brought
in
a
boiling
samovar
when
everything
was
ready
the
stranger
opened
his
eyes
moved
to
the
table
filled
a
tumbler
with
tea
for
himself
and
one
for
the
beardless
old
man
to
whom
he
passed
it
pierre
began
to
feel
a
sense
of
uneasiness
and
the
need
even
the
inevitability
of
entering
into
conversation
with
this
stranger
the
servant
brought
back
his
tumbler
turned
upside
down
with
an
unfinished
bit
of
nibbled
sugar
and
asked
if
anything
more
would
be
wanted
to
indicate
he
did
not
want
more
tea
no
give
me
the
book
said
the
stranger
the
servant
handed
him
a
book
which
pierre
took
to
be
a
devotional
work
and
the
traveler
became
absorbed
in
it
pierre
looked
at
him
all
at
once
the
stranger
closed
the
book
putting
in
a
marker
and
again
leaning
with
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
sat
in
his
former
position
with
his
eyes
shut
pierre
looked
at
him
and
had
not
time
to
turn
away
when
the
old
man
opening
his
eyes
fixed
his
steady
and
severe
gaze
straight
on
pierre
s
face
pierre
felt
confused
and
wished
to
avoid
that
look
but
the
bright
old
eyes
attracted
him
irresistibly
chapter
ii
i
have
the
pleasure
of
addressing
count
bezukhov
if
i
am
not
mistaken
said
the
stranger
in
a
deliberate
and
loud
voice
pierre
looked
silently
and
inquiringly
at
him
over
his
spectacles
i
have
heard
of
you
my
dear
sir
continued
the
stranger
and
of
your
misfortune
he
seemed
to
emphasize
the
last
word
as
if
to
say
yes
misfortune
call
it
what
you
please
i
know
that
what
happened
to
you
in
moscow
was
a
misfortune
i
regret
it
very
much
my
dear
sir
pierre
flushed
and
hurriedly
putting
his
legs
down
from
the
bed
bent
forward
toward
the
old
man
with
a
forced
and
timid
smile
i
have
not
referred
to
this
out
of
curiosity
my
dear
sir
but
for
greater
reasons
he
paused
his
gaze
still
on
pierre
and
moved
aside
on
the
sofa
by
way
of
inviting
the
other
to
take
a
seat
beside
him
pierre
felt
reluctant
to
enter
into
conversation
with
this
old
man
but
submitting
to
him
involuntarily
came
up
and
sat
down
beside
him
you
are
unhappy
my
dear
sir
the
stranger
continued
you
are
young
and
i
am
old
i
should
like
to
help
you
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power
oh
yes
said
pierre
with
a
forced
smile
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
where
are
you
traveling
from
the
stranger
s
face
was
not
genial
it
was
even
cold
and
severe
but
in
spite
of
this
both
the
face
and
words
of
his
new
acquaintance
were
irresistibly
attractive
to
pierre
but
if
for
any
reason
you
don
t
feel
inclined
to
talk
to
me
said
the
old
man
say
so
my
dear
sir
and
he
suddenly
smiled
in
an
unexpected
and
tenderly
paternal
way
oh
no
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
pierre
and
again
glancing
at
the
stranger
s
hands
he
looked
more
closely
at
the
ring
with
its
skull
a
masonic
sign
allow
me
to
ask
he
said
are
you
a
mason
yes
i
belong
to
the
brotherhood
of
the
freemasons
said
the
stranger
looking
deeper
and
deeper
into
pierre
s
eyes
and
in
their
name
and
my
own
i
hold
out
a
brotherly
hand
to
you
i
am
afraid
said
pierre
smiling
and
wavering
between
the
confidence
the
personality
of
the
freemason
inspired
in
him
and
his
own
habit
of
ridiculing
the
masonic
beliefs
i
am
afraid
i
am
very
far
from
understanding
how
am
i
to
put
it
i
am
afraid
my
way
of
looking
at
the
world
is
so
opposed
to
yours
that
we
shall
not
understand
one
another
i
know
your
outlook
said
the
mason
and
the
view
of
life
you
mention
and
which
you
think
is
the
result
of
your
own
mental
efforts
is
the
one
held
by
the
majority
of
people
and
is
the
invariable
fruit
of
pride
indolence
and
ignorance
forgive
me
my
dear
sir
but
if
i
had
not
known
it
i
should
not
have
addressed
you
your
view
of
life
is
a
regrettable
delusion
just
as
i
may
suppose
you
to
be
deluded
said
pierre
with
a
faint
smile
i
should
never
dare
to
say
that
i
know
the
truth
said
the
mason
whose
words
struck
pierre
more
and
more
by
their
precision
and
firmness
no
one
can
attain
to
truth
by
himself
only
by
laying
stone
on
stone
with
the
cooperation
of
all
by
the
millions
of
generations
from
our
forefather
adam
to
our
own
times
is
that
temple
reared
which
is
to
be
a
worthy
dwelling
place
of
the
great
god
he
added
and
closed
his
eyes
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
do
not
believe
do
not
believe
in
god
said
pierre
regretfully
and
with
an
effort
feeling
it
essential
to
speak
the
whole
truth
the
mason
looked
intently
at
pierre
and
smiled
as
a
rich
man
with
millions
in
hand
might
smile
at
a
poor
fellow
who
told
him
that
he
poor
man
had
not
the
five
rubles
that
would
make
him
happy
yes
you
do
not
know
him
my
dear
sir
said
the
mason
you
cannot
know
him
you
do
not
know
him
and
that
is
why
you
are
unhappy
yes
yes
i
am
unhappy
assented
pierre
but
what
am
i
to
do
you
know
him
not
my
dear
sir
and
so
you
are
very
unhappy
you
do
not
know
him
but
he
is
here
he
is
in
me
he
is
in
my
words
he
is
in
thee
and
even
in
those
blasphemous
words
thou
hast
just
uttered
pronounced
the
mason
in
a
stern
and
tremulous
voice
he
paused
and
sighed
evidently
trying
to
calm
himself
if
he
were
not
he
said
quietly
you
and
i
would
not
be
speaking
of
him
my
dear
sir
of
what
of
whom
are
we
speaking
whom
hast
thou
denied
he
suddenly
asked
with
exulting
austerity
and
authority
in
his
voice
who
invented
him
if
he
did
not
exist
whence
came
thy
conception
of
the
existence
of
such
an
incomprehensible
being
didst
thou
and
why
did
the
whole
world
conceive
the
idea
of
the
existence
of
such
an
incomprehensible
being
a
being
all
powerful
eternal
and
infinite
in
all
his
attributes
he
stopped
and
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
pierre
could
not
and
did
not
wish
to
break
this
silence
he
exists
but
to
understand
him
is
hard
the
mason
began
again
looking
not
at
pierre
but
straight
before
him
and
turning
the
leaves
of
his
book
with
his
old
hands
which
from
excitement
he
could
not
keep
still
if
it
were
a
man
whose
existence
thou
didst
doubt
i
could
bring
him
to
thee
could
take
him
by
the
hand
and
show
him
to
thee
but
how
can
i
an
insignificant
mortal
show
his
omnipotence
his
infinity
and
all
his
mercy
to
one
who
is
blind
or
who
shuts
his
eyes
that
he
may
not
see
or
understand
him
and
may
not
see
or
understand
his
own
vileness
and
sinfulness
he
paused
again
who
art
thou
thou
dreamest
that
thou
art
wise
because
thou
couldst
utter
those
blasphemous
words
he
went
on
with
a
somber
and
scornful
smile
and
thou
art
more
foolish
and
unreasonable
than
a
little
child
who
playing
with
the
parts
of
a
skillfully
made
watch
dares
to
say
that
as
he
does
not
understand
its
use
he
does
not
believe
in
the
master
who
made
it
to
know
him
is
hard
for
ages
from
our
forefather
adam
to
our
own
day
we
labor
to
attain
that
knowledge
and
are
still
infinitely
far
from
our
aim
but
in
our
lack
of
understanding
we
see
only
our
weakness
and
his
greatness
pierre
listened
with
swelling
heart
gazing
into
the
mason
s
face
with
shining
eyes
not
interrupting
or
questioning
him
but
believing
with
his
whole
soul
what
the
stranger
said
whether
he
accepted
the
wise
reasoning
contained
in
the
mason
s
words
or
believed
as
a
child
believes
in
the
speaker
s
tone
of
conviction
and
earnestness
or
the
tremor
of
the
speaker
s
voice
which
sometimes
almost
broke
or
those
brilliant
aged
eyes
grown
old
in
this
conviction
or
the
calm
firmness
and
certainty
of
his
vocation
which
radiated
from
his
whole
being
and
which
struck
pierre
especially
by
contrast
with
his
own
dejection
and
hopelessness
at
any
rate
pierre
longed
with
his
whole
soul
to
believe
and
he
did
believe
and
felt
a
joyful
sense
of
comfort
regeneration
and
return
to
life
he
is
not
to
be
apprehended
by
reason
but
by
life
said
the
mason
i
do
not
understand
said
pierre
feeling
with
dismay
doubts
reawakening
he
was
afraid
of
any
want
of
clearness
any
weakness
in
the
mason
s
arguments
he
dreaded
not
to
be
able
to
believe
in
him
i
don
t
understand
he
said
how
it
is
that
the
mind
of
man
cannot
attain
the
knowledge
of
which
you
speak
the
mason
smiled
with
his
gentle
fatherly
smile
the
highest
wisdom
and
truth
are
like
the
purest
liquid
we
may
wish
to
imbibe
he
said
can
i
receive
that
pure
liquid
into
an
impure
vessel
and
judge
of
its
purity
only
by
the
inner
purification
of
myself
can
i
retain
in
some
degree
of
purity
the
liquid
i
receive
yes
yes
that
is
so
said
pierre
joyfully
the
highest
wisdom
is
not
founded
on
reason
alone
not
on
those
worldly
sciences
of
physics
history
chemistry
and
the
like
into
which
intellectual
knowledge
is
divided
the
highest
wisdom
is
one
the
highest
wisdom
has
but
one
science
the
science
of
the
whole
the
science
explaining
the
whole
creation
and
man
s
place
in
it
to
receive
that
science
it
is
necessary
to
purify
and
renew
one
s
inner
self
and
so
before
one
can
know
it
is
necessary
to
believe
and
to
perfect
one
s
self
and
to
attain
this
end
we
have
the
light
called
conscience
that
god
has
implanted
in
our
souls
yes
yes
assented
pierre
look
then
at
thy
inner
self
with
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
and
ask
thyself
whether
thou
art
content
with
thyself
what
hast
thou
attained
relying
on
reason
only
what
art
thou
you
are
young
you
are
rich
you
are
clever
you
are
well
educated
and
what
have
you
done
with
all
these
good
gifts
are
you
content
with
yourself
and
with
your
life
no
i
hate
my
life
pierre
muttered
wincing
thou
hatest
it
then
change
it
purify
thyself
and
as
thou
art
purified
thou
wilt
gain
wisdom
look
at
your
life
my
dear
sir
how
have
you
spent
it
in
riotous
orgies
and
debauchery
receiving
everything
from
society
and
giving
nothing
in
return
you
have
become
the
possessor
of
wealth
how
have
you
used
it
what
have
you
done
for
your
neighbor
have
you
ever
thought
of
your
tens
of
thousands
of
slaves
have
you
helped
them
physically
and
morally
no
you
have
profited
by
their
toil
to
lead
a
profligate
life
that
is
what
you
have
done
have
you
chosen
a
post
in
which
you
might
be
of
service
to
your
neighbor
no
you
have
spent
your
life
in
idleness
then
you
married
my
dear
sir
took
on
yourself
responsibility
for
the
guidance
of
a
young
woman
and
what
have
you
done
you
have
not
helped
her
to
find
the
way
of
truth
my
dear
sir
but
have
thrust
her
into
an
abyss
of
deceit
and
misery
a
man
offended
you
and
you
shot
him
and
you
say
you
do
not
know
god
and
hate
your
life
there
is
nothing
strange
in
that
my
dear
sir
after
these
words
the
mason
as
if
tired
by
his
long
discourse
again
leaned
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
closed
his
eyes
pierre
looked
at
that
aged
stern
motionless
almost
lifeless
face
and
moved
his
lips
without
uttering
a
sound
he
wished
to
say
yes
a
vile
idle
vicious
life
but
dared
not
break
the
silence
the
mason
cleared
his
throat
huskily
as
old
men
do
and
called
his
servant
how
about
the
horses
he
asked
without
looking
at
pierre
the
exchange
horses
have
just
come
answered
the
servant
will
you
not
rest
here
no
tell
them
to
harness
can
he
really
be
going
away
leaving
me
alone
without
having
told
me
all
and
without
promising
to
help
me
thought
pierre
rising
with
downcast
head
and
he
began
to
pace
the
room
glancing
occasionally
at
the
mason
yes
i
never
thought
of
it
but
i
have
led
a
contemptible
and
profligate
life
though
i
did
not
like
it
and
did
not
want
to
thought
pierre
but
this
man
knows
the
truth
and
if
he
wished
to
could
disclose
it
to
me
pierre
wished
to
say
this
to
the
mason
but
did
not
dare
to
the
traveler
having
packed
his
things
with
his
practiced
hands
began
fastening
his
coat
when
he
had
finished
he
turned
to
bezukhov
and
said
in
a
tone
of
indifferent
politeness
where
are
you
going
to
now
my
dear
sir
i
i
m
going
to
petersburg
answered
pierre
in
a
childlike
hesitating
voice
i
thank
you
i
agree
with
all
you
have
said
but
do
not
suppose
me
to
be
so
bad
with
my
whole
soul
i
wish
to
be
what
you
would
have
me
be
but
i
have
never
had
help
from
anyone
but
it
is
i
above
all
who
am
to
blame
for
everything
help
me
teach
me
and
perhaps
i
may
pierre
could
not
go
on
he
gulped
and
turned
away
the
mason
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
evidently
considering
help
comes
from
god
alone
he
said
but
such
measure
of
help
as
our
order
can
bestow
it
will
render
you
my
dear
sir
you
are
going
to
petersburg
hand
this
to
count
willarski
he
took
out
his
notebook
and
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
folded
in
four
allow
me
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
when
you
reach
the
capital
first
of
all
devote
some
time
to
solitude
and
self
examination
and
do
not
resume
your
former
way
of
life
and
now
i
wish
you
a
good
journey
my
dear
sir
he
added
seeing
that
his
servant
had
entered
and
success
the
traveler
was
joseph
alexeevich
bazdeev
as
pierre
saw
from
the
postmaster
s
book
bazdeev
had
been
one
of
the
best
known
freemasons
and
martinists
even
in
novikov
s
time
for
a
long
while
after
he
had
gone
pierre
did
not
go
to
bed
or
order
horses
but
paced
up
and
down
the
room
pondering
over
his
vicious
past
and
with
a
rapturous
sense
of
beginning
anew
pictured
to
himself
the
blissful
irreproachable
virtuous
future
that
seemed
to
him
so
easy
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
vicious
only
because
he
had
somehow
forgotten
how
good
it
is
to
be
virtuous
not
a
trace
of
his
former
doubts
remained
in
his
soul
he
firmly
believed
in
the
possibility
of
the
brotherhood
of
men
united
in
the
aim
of
supporting
one
another
in
the
path
of
virtue
and
that
is
how
freemasonry
presented
itself
to
him
chapter
iii
on
reaching
petersburg
pierre
did
not
let
anyone
know
of
his
arrival
he
went
nowhere
and
spent
whole
days
in
reading
thomas
a
kempis
whose
book
had
been
sent
him
by
someone
unknown
one
thing
he
continually
realized
as
he
read
that
book
the
joy
hitherto
unknown
to
him
of
believing
in
the
possibility
of
attaining
perfection
and
in
the
possibility
of
active
brotherly
love
among
men
which
joseph
alexeevich
had
revealed
to
him
a
week
after
his
arrival
the
young
polish
count
willarski
whom
pierre
had
known
slightly
in
petersburg
society
came
into
his
room
one
evening
in
the
official
and
ceremonious
manner
in
which
dolokhov
s
second
had
called
on
him
and
having
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
room
addressed
pierre
i
have
come
to
you
with
a
message
and
an
offer
count
he
said
without
sitting
down
a
person
of
very
high
standing
in
our
brotherhood
has
made
application
for
you
to
be
received
into
our
order
before
the
usual
term
and
has
proposed
to
me
to
be
your
sponsor
i
consider
it
a
sacred
duty
to
fulfill
that
person
s
wishes
do
you
wish
to
enter
the
brotherhood
of
freemasons
under
my
sponsorship
the
cold
austere
tone
of
this
man
whom
he
had
almost
always
before
met
at
balls
amiably
smiling
in
the
society
of
the
most
brilliant
women
surprised
pierre
yes
i
do
wish
it
said
he
willarski
bowed
his
head
one
more
question
count
he
said
which
i
beg
you
to
answer
in
all
sincerity
not
as
a
future
mason
but
as
an
honest
man
have
you
renounced
your
former
convictions
do
you
believe
in
god
pierre
considered
yes
yes
i
believe
in
god
he
said
in
that
case
began
willarski
but
pierre
interrupted
him
yes
i
do
believe
in
god
he
repeated
in
that
case
we
can
go
said
willarski
my
carriage
is
at
your
service
willarski
was
silent
throughout
the
drive
to
pierre
s
inquiries
as
to
what
he
must
do
and
how
he
should
answer
willarski
only
replied
that
brothers
more
worthy
than
he
would
test
him
and
that
pierre
had
only
to
tell
the
truth
having
entered
the
courtyard
of
a
large
house
where
the
lodge
had
its
headquarters
and
having
ascended
a
dark
staircase
they
entered
a
small
well
lit
anteroom
where
they
took
off
their
cloaks
without
the
aid
of
a
servant
from
there
they
passed
into
another
room
a
man
in
strange
attire
appeared
at
the
door
willarski
stepping
toward
him
said
something
to
him
in
french
in
an
undertone
and
then
went
up
to
a
small
wardrobe
in
which
pierre
noticed
garments
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
having
taken
a
kerchief
from
the
cupboard
willarski
bound
pierre
s
eyes
with
it
and
tied
it
in
a
knot
behind
catching
some
hairs
painfully
in
the
knot
then
he
drew
his
face
down
kissed
him
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
led
him
forward
the
hairs
tied
in
the
knot
hurt
pierre
and
there
were
lines
of
pain
on
his
face
and
a
shamefaced
smile
his
huge
figure
with
arms
hanging
down
and
with
a
puckered
though
smiling
face
moved
after
willarski
with
uncertain
timid
steps
having
led
him
about
ten
paces
willarski
stopped
whatever
happens
to
you
he
said
you
must
bear
it
all
manfully
if
you
have
firmly
resolved
to
join
our
brotherhood
pierre
nodded
affirmatively
when
you
hear
a
knock
at
the
door
you
will
uncover
your
eyes
added
willarski
i
wish
you
courage
and
success
and
pressing
pierre
s
hand
he
went
out
left
alone
pierre
went
on
smiling
in
the
same
way
once
or
twice
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
hand
to
the
kerchief
as
if
wishing
to
take
it
off
but
let
it
drop
again
the
five
minutes
spent
with
his
eyes
bandaged
seemed
to
him
an
hour
his
arms
felt
numb
his
legs
almost
gave
way
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
tired
out
he
experienced
a
variety
of
most
complex
sensations
he
felt
afraid
of
what
would
happen
to
him
and
still
more
afraid
of
showing
his
fear
he
felt
curious
to
know
what
was
going
to
happen
and
what
would
be
revealed
to
him
but
most
of
all
he
felt
joyful
that
the
moment
had
come
when
he
would
at
last
start
on
that
path
of
regeneration
and
on
the
actively
virtuous
life
of
which
he
had
been
dreaming
since
he
met
joseph
alexeevich
loud
knocks
were
heard
at
the
door
pierre
took
the
bandage
off
his
eyes
and
glanced
around
him
the
room
was
in
black
darkness
only
a
small
lamp
was
burning
inside
something
white
pierre
went
nearer
and
saw
that
the
lamp
stood
on
a
black
table
on
which
lay
an
open
book
the
book
was
the
gospel
and
the
white
thing
with
the
lamp
inside
was
a
human
skull
with
its
cavities
and
teeth
after
reading
the
first
words
of
the
gospel
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
pierre
went
round
the
table
and
saw
a
large
open
box
filled
with
something
it
was
a
coffin
with
bones
inside
he
was
not
at
all
surprised
by
what
he
saw
hoping
to
enter
on
an
entirely
new
life
quite
unlike
the
old
one
he
expected
everything
to
be
unusual
even
more
unusual
than
what
he
was
seeing
a
skull
a
coffin
the
gospel
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
expected
all
this
and
even
more
trying
to
stimulate
his
emotions
he
looked
around
god
death
love
the
brotherhood
of
man
he
kept
saying
to
himself
associating
these
words
with
vague
yet
joyful
ideas
the
door
opened
and
someone
came
in
by
the
dim
light
to
which
pierre
had
already
become
accustomed
he
saw
a
rather
short
man
having
evidently
come
from
the
light
into
the
darkness
the
man
paused
then
moved
with
cautious
steps
toward
the
table
and
placed
on
it
his
small
leather
gloved
hands
this
short
man
had
on
a
white
leather
apron
which
covered
his
chest
and
part
of
his
legs
he
had
on
a
kind
of
necklace
above
which
rose
a
high
white
ruffle
outlining
his
rather
long
face
which
was
lit
up
from
below
for
what
have
you
come
hither
asked
the
newcomer
turning
in
pierre
s
direction
at
a
slight
rustle
made
by
the
latter
why
have
you
who
do
not
believe
in
the
truth
of
the
light
and
who
have
not
seen
the
light
come
here
what
do
you
seek
from
us
wisdom
virtue
enlightenment
at
the
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
stranger
came
in
pierre
felt
a
sense
of
awe
and
veneration
such
as
he
had
experienced
in
his
boyhood
at
confession
he
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
one
socially
a
complete
stranger
yet
nearer
to
him
through
the
brotherhood
of
man
with
bated
breath
and
beating
heart
he
moved
toward
the
rhetor
by
which
name
the
brother
who
prepared
a
seeker
for
entrance
into
the
brotherhood
was
known
drawing
nearer
he
recognized
in
the
rhetor
a
man
he
knew
smolyaninov
and
it
mortified
him
to
think
that
the
newcomer
was
an
acquaintance
he
wished
him
simply
a
brother
and
a
virtuous
instructor
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
utter
a
word
so
that
the
rhetor
had
to
repeat
his
question
yes
i
i
desire
regeneration
pierre
uttered
with
difficulty
very
well
said
smolyaninov
and
went
on
at
once
have
you
any
idea
of
the
means
by
which
our
holy
order
will
help
you
to
reach
your
aim
said
he
quietly
and
quickly
i
hope
for
guidance
help
in
regeneration
said
pierre
with
a
trembling
voice
and
some
difficulty
in
utterance
due
to
his
excitement
and
to
being
unaccustomed
to
speak
of
abstract
matters
in
russian
what
is
your
conception
of
freemasonry
i
imagine
that
freemasonry
is
the
fraternity
and
equality
of
men
who
have
virtuous
aims
said
pierre
feeling
ashamed
of
the
inadequacy
of
his
words
for
the
solemnity
of
the
moment
as
he
spoke
i
imagine
good
said
the
rhetor
quickly
apparently
satisfied
with
this
answer
have
you
sought
for
means
of
attaining
your
aim
in
religion
no
i
considered
it
erroneous
and
did
not
follow
it
said
pierre
so
softly
that
the
rhetor
did
not
hear
him
and
asked
him
what
he
was
saying
i
have
been
an
atheist
answered
pierre
you
are
seeking
for
truth
in
order
to
follow
its
laws
in
your
life
therefore
you
seek
wisdom
and
virtue
is
that
not
so
said
the
rhetor
after
a
moment
s
pause
yes
yes
assented
pierre
the
rhetor
cleared
his
throat
crossed
his
gloved
hands
on
his
breast
and
began
to
speak
now
i
must
disclose
to
you
the
chief
aim
of
our
order
he
said
and
if
this
aim
coincides
with
yours
you
may
enter
our
brotherhood
with
profit
the
first
and
chief
object
of
our
order
the
foundation
on
which
it
rests
and
which
no
human
power
can
destroy
is
the
preservation
and
handing
on
to
posterity
of
a
certain
important
mystery
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
the
remotest
ages
even
from
the
first
man
a
mystery
on
which
perhaps
the
fate
of
mankind
depends
but
since
this
mystery
is
of
such
a
nature
that
nobody
can
know
or
use
it
unless
he
be
prepared
by
long
and
diligent
self
purification
not
everyone
can
hope
to
attain
it
quickly
hence
we
have
a
secondary
aim
that
of
preparing
our
members
as
much
as
possible
to
reform
their
hearts
to
purify
and
enlighten
their
minds
by
means
handed
on
to
us
by
tradition
from
those
who
have
striven
to
attain
this
mystery
and
thereby
to
render
them
capable
of
receiving
it
by
purifying
and
regenerating
our
members
we
try
thirdly
to
improve
the
whole
human
race
offering
it
in
our
members
an
example
of
piety
and
virtue
and
thereby
try
with
all
our
might
to
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
world
think
this
over
and
i
will
come
to
you
again
to
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
world
pierre
repeated
and
a
mental
image
of
his
future
activity
in
this
direction
rose
in
his
mind
he
imagined
men
such
as
he
had
himself
been
a
fortnight
ago
and
he
addressed
an
edifying
exhortation
to
them
he
imagined
to
himself
vicious
and
unfortunate
people
whom
he
would
assist
by
word
and
deed
imagined
oppressors
whose
victims
he
would
rescue
of
the
three
objects
mentioned
by
the
rhetor
this
last
that
of
improving
mankind
especially
appealed
to
pierre
the
important
mystery
mentioned
by
the
rhetor
though
it
aroused
his
curiosity
did
not
seem
to
him
essential
and
the
second
aim
that
of
purifying
and
regenerating
himself
did
not
much
interest
him
because
at
that
moment
he
felt
with
delight
that
he
was
already
perfectly
cured
of
his
former
faults
and
was
ready
for
all
that
was
good
half
an
hour
later
the
rhetor
returned
to
inform
the
seeker
of
the
seven
virtues
corresponding
to
the
seven
steps
of
solomon
s
temple
which
every
freemason
should
cultivate
in
himself
these
virtues
were
discretion
the
keeping
of
the
secrets
of
the
order
obedience
to
those
of
higher
ranks
in
the
order
morality
love
of
mankind
courage
generosity
the
love
of
death
in
the
seventh
place
try
by
the
frequent
thought
of
death
the
rhetor
said
to
bring
yourself
to
regard
it
not
as
a
dreaded
foe
but
as
a
friend
that
frees
the
soul
grown
weary
in
the
labors
of
virtue
from
this
distressful
life
and
leads
it
to
its
place
of
recompense
and
peace
yes
that
must
be
so
thought
pierre
when
after
these
words
the
rhetor
went
away
leaving
him
to
solitary
meditation
it
must
be
so
but
i
am
still
so
weak
that
i
love
my
life
the
meaning
of
which
is
only
now
gradually
opening
before
me
but
five
of
the
other
virtues
which
pierre
recalled
counting
them
on
his
fingers
he
felt
already
in
his
soul
courage
generosity
morality
love
of
mankind
and
especially
obedience
which
did
not
even
seem
to
him
a
virtue
but
a
joy
he
now
felt
so
glad
to
be
free
from
his
own
lawlessness
and
to
submit
his
will
to
those
who
knew
the
indubitable
truth
he
forgot
what
the
seventh
virtue
was
and
could
not
recall
it
the
third
time
the
rhetor
came
back
more
quickly
and
asked
pierre
whether
he
was
still
firm
in
his
intention
and
determined
to
submit
to
all
that
would
be
required
of
him
i
am
ready
for
everything
said
pierre
i
must
also
inform
you
said
the
rhetor
that
our
order
delivers
its
teaching
not
in
words
only
but
also
by
other
means
which
may
perhaps
have
a
stronger
effect
on
the
sincere
seeker
after
wisdom
and
virtue
than
mere
words
this
chamber
with
what
you
see
therein
should
already
have
suggested
to
your
heart
if
it
is
sincere
more
than
words
could
do
you
will
perhaps
also
see
in
your
further
initiation
a
like
method
of
enlightenment
our
order
imitates
the
ancient
societies
that
explained
their
teaching
by
hieroglyphics
a
hieroglyph
said
the
rhetor
is
an
emblem
of
something
not
cognizable
by
the
senses
but
which
possesses
qualities
resembling
those
of
the
symbol
pierre
knew
very
well
what
a
hieroglyph
was
but
dared
not
speak
he
listened
to
the
rhetor
in
silence
feeling
from
all
he
said
that
his
ordeal
was
about
to
begin
if
you
are
resolved
i
must
begin
your
initiation
said
the
rhetor
coming
closer
to
pierre
in
token
of
generosity
i
ask
you
to
give
me
all
your
valuables
but
i
have
nothing
here
replied
pierre
supposing
that
he
was
asked
to
give
up
all
he
possessed
what
you
have
with
you
watch
money
rings
pierre
quickly
took
out
his
purse
and
watch
but
could
not
manage
for
some
time
to
get
the
wedding
ring
off
his
fat
finger
when
that
had
been
done
the
rhetor
said
in
token
of
obedience
i
ask
you
to
undress
pierre
took
off
his
coat
waistcoat
and
left
boot
according
to
the
rhetor
s
instructions
the
mason
drew
the
shirt
back
from
pierre
s
left
breast
and
stooping
down
pulled
up
the
left
leg
of
his
trousers
to
above
the
knee
pierre
hurriedly
began
taking
off
his
right
boot
also
and
was
going
to
tuck
up
the
other
trouser
leg
to
save
this
stranger
the
trouble
but
the
mason
told
him
that
was
not
necessary
and
gave
him
a
slipper
for
his
left
foot
with
a
childlike
smile
of
embarrassment
doubt
and
self
derision
which
appeared
on
his
face
against
his
will
pierre
stood
with
his
arms
hanging
down
and
legs
apart
before
his
brother
rhetor
and
awaited
his
further
commands
and
now
in
token
of
candor
i
ask
you
to
reveal
to
me
your
chief
passion
said
the
latter
my
passion
i
have
had
so
many
replied
pierre
that
passion
which
more
than
all
others
caused
you
to
waver
on
the
path
of
virtue
said
the
mason
pierre
paused
seeking
a
reply
wine
gluttony
idleness
laziness
irritability
anger
women
he
went
over
his
vices
in
his
mind
not
knowing
to
which
of
them
to
give
the
pre
eminence
women
he
said
in
a
low
scarcely
audible
voice
the
mason
did
not
move
and
for
a
long
time
said
nothing
after
this
answer
at
last
he
moved
up
to
pierre
and
taking
the
kerchief
that
lay
on
the
table
again
bound
his
eyes
for
the
last
time
i
say
to
you
turn
all
your
attention
upon
yourself
put
a
bridle
on
your
senses
and
seek
blessedness
not
in
passion
but
in
your
own
heart
the
source
of
blessedness
is
not
without
us
but
within
pierre
had
already
long
been
feeling
in
himself
that
refreshing
source
of
blessedness
which
now
flooded
his
heart
with
glad
emotion
chapter
iv
soon
after
this
there
came
into
the
dark
chamber
to
fetch
pierre
not
the
rhetor
but
pierre
s
sponsor
willarski
whom
he
recognized
by
his
voice
to
fresh
questions
as
to
the
firmness
of
his
resolution
pierre
replied
yes
yes
i
agree
and
with
a
beaming
childlike
smile
his
fat
chest
uncovered
stepping
unevenly
and
timidly
in
one
slippered
and
one
booted
foot
he
advanced
while
willarski
held
a
sword
to
his
bare
chest
he
was
conducted
from
that
room
along
passages
that
turned
backwards
and
forwards
and
was
at
last
brought
to
the
doors
of
the
lodge
willarski
coughed
he
was
answered
by
the
masonic
knock
with
mallets
the
doors
opened
before
them
a
bass
voice
pierre
was
still
blindfolded
questioned
him
as
to
who
he
was
when
and
where
he
was
born
and
so
on
then
he
was
again
led
somewhere
still
blindfolded
and
as
they
went
along
he
was
told
allegories
of
the
toils
of
his
pilgrimage
of
holy
friendship
of
the
eternal
architect
of
the
universe
and
of
the
courage
with
which
he
should
endure
toils
and
dangers
during
these
wanderings
pierre
noticed
that
he
was
spoken
of
now
as
the
seeker
now
as
the
sufferer
and
now
as
the
postulant
to
the
accompaniment
of
various
knockings
with
mallets
and
swords
as
he
was
being
led
up
to
some
object
he
noticed
a
hesitation
and
uncertainty
among
his
conductors
he
heard
those
around
him
disputing
in
whispers
and
one
of
them
insisting
that
he
should
be
led
along
a
certain
carpet
after
that
they
took
his
right
hand
placed
it
on
something
and
told
him
to
hold
a
pair
of
compasses
to
his
left
breast
with
the
other
hand
and
to
repeat
after
someone
who
read
aloud
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
laws
of
the
order
the
candles
were
then
extinguished
and
some
spirit
lighted
as
pierre
knew
by
the
smell
and
he
was
told
that
he
would
now
see
the
lesser
light
the
bandage
was
taken
off
his
eyes
and
by
the
faint
light
of
the
burning
spirit
pierre
as
in
a
dream
saw
several
men
standing
before
him
wearing
aprons
like
the
rhetor
s
and
holding
swords
in
their
hands
pointed
at
his
breast
among
them
stood
a
man
whose
white
shirt
was
stained
with
blood
on
seeing
this
pierre
moved
forward
with
his
breast
toward
the
swords
meaning
them
to
pierce
it
but
the
swords
were
drawn
back
from
him
and
he
was
at
once
blindfolded
again
now
thou
hast
seen
the
lesser
light
uttered
a
voice
then
the
candles
were
relit
and
he
was
told
that
he
would
see
the
full
light
the
bandage
was
again
removed
and
more
than
ten
voices
said
together
sic
transit
gloria
mundi
pierre
gradually
began
to
recover
himself
and
looked
about
at
the
room
and
at
the
people
in
it
round
a
long
table
covered
with
black
sat
some
twelve
men
in
garments
like
those
he
had
already
seen
some
of
them
pierre
had
met
in
petersburg
society
in
the
president
s
chair
sat
a
young
man
he
did
not
know
with
a
peculiar
cross
hanging
from
his
neck
on
his
right
sat
the
italian
abbe
whom
pierre
had
met
at
anna
pavlovna
s
two
years
before
there
were
also
present
a
very
distinguished
dignitary
and
a
swiss
who
had
formerly
been
tutor
at
the
kuragins
all
maintained
a
solemn
silence
listening
to
the
words
of
the
president
who
held
a
mallet
in
his
hand
let
into
the
wall
was
a
star
shaped
light
at
one
side
of
the
table
was
a
small
carpet
with
various
figures
worked
upon
it
at
the
other
was
something
resembling
an
altar
on
which
lay
a
testament
and
a
skull
round
it
stood
seven
large
candlesticks
like
those
used
in
churches
two
of
the
brothers
led
pierre
up
to
the
altar
placed
his
feet
at
right
angles
and
bade
him
lie
down
saying
that
he
must
prostrate
himself
at
the
gates
of
the
temple
he
must
first
receive
the
trowel
whispered
one
of
the
brothers
oh
hush
please
said
another
pierre
perplexed
looked
round
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
without
obeying
and
suddenly
doubts
arose
in
his
mind
where
am
i
what
am
i
doing
aren
t
they
laughing
at
me
shan
t
i
be
ashamed
to
remember
this
but
these
doubts
only
lasted
a
moment
pierre
glanced
at
the
serious
faces
of
those
around
remembered
all
he
had
already
gone
through
and
realized
that
he
could
not
stop
halfway
he
was
aghast
at
his
hesitation
and
trying
to
arouse
his
former
devotional
feeling
prostrated
himself
before
the
gates
of
the
temple
and
really
the
feeling
of
devotion
returned
to
him
even
more
strongly
than
before
when
he
had
lain
there
some
time
he
was
told
to
get
up
and
a
white
leather
apron
such
as
the
others
wore
was
put
on
him
he
was
given
a
trowel
and
three
pairs
of
gloves
and
then
the
grand
master
addressed
him
he
told
him
that
he
should
try
to
do
nothing
to
stain
the
whiteness
of
that
apron
which
symbolized
strength
and
purity
then
of
the
unexplained
trowel
he
told
him
to
toil
with
it
to
cleanse
his
own
heart
from
vice
and
indulgently
to
smooth
with
it
the
heart
of
his
neighbor
as
to
the
first
pair
of
gloves
a
man
s
he
said
that
pierre
could
not
know
their
meaning
but
must
keep
them
the
second
pair
of
man
s
gloves
he
was
to
wear
at
the
meetings
and
finally
of
the
third
a
pair
of
women
s
gloves
he
said
dear
brother
these
woman
s
gloves
are
intended
for
you
too
give
them
to
the
woman
whom
you
shall
honor
most
of
all
this
gift
will
be
a
pledge
of
your
purity
of
heart
to
her
whom
you
select
to
be
your
worthy
helpmeet
in
masonry
and
after
a
pause
he
added
but
beware
dear
brother
that
these
gloves
do
not
deck
hands
that
are
unclean
while
the
grand
master
said
these
last
words
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
he
grew
embarrassed
pierre
himself
grew
still
more
confused
blushed
like
a
child
till
tears
came
to
his
eyes
began
looking
about
him
uneasily
and
an
awkward
pause
followed
this
silence
was
broken
by
one
of
the
brethren
who
led
pierre
up
to
the
rug
and
began
reading
to
him
from
a
manuscript
book
an
explanation
of
all
the
figures
on
it
the
sun
the
moon
a
hammer
a
plumb
line
a
trowel
a
rough
stone
and
a
squared
stone
a
pillar
three
windows
and
so
on
then
a
place
was
assigned
to
pierre
he
was
shown
the
signs
of
the
lodge
told
the
password
and
at
last
was
permitted
to
sit
down
the
grand
master
began
reading
the
statutes
they
were
very
long
and
pierre
from
joy
agitation
and
embarrassment
was
not
in
a
state
to
understand
what
was
being
read
he
managed
to
follow
only
the
last
words
of
the
statutes
and
these
remained
in
his
mind
in
our
temples
we
recognize
no
other
distinctions
read
the
grand
master
but
those
between
virtue
and
vice
beware
of
making
any
distinctions
which
may
infringe
equality
fly
to
a
brother
s
aid
whoever
he
may
be
exhort
him
who
goeth
astray
raise
him
that
falleth
never
bear
malice
or
enmity
toward
thy
brother
be
kindly
and
courteous
kindle
in
all
hearts
the
flame
of
virtue
share
thy
happiness
with
thy
neighbor
and
may
envy
never
dim
the
purity
of
that
bliss
forgive
thy
enemy
do
not
avenge
thyself
except
by
doing
him
good
thus
fulfilling
the
highest
law
thou
shalt
regain
traces
of
the
ancient
dignity
which
thou
hast
lost
he
finished
and
getting
up
embraced
and
kissed
pierre
who
with
tears
of
joy
in
his
eyes
looked
round
him
not
knowing
how
to
answer
the
congratulations
and
greetings
from
acquaintances
that
met
him
on
all
sides
he
acknowledged
no
acquaintances
but
saw
in
all
these
men
only
brothers
and
burned
with
impatience
to
set
to
work
with
them
the
grand
master
rapped
with
his
mallet
all
the
masons
sat
down
in
their
places
and
one
of
them
read
an
exhortation
on
the
necessity
of
humility
the
grand
master
proposed
that
the
last
duty
should
be
performed
and
the
distinguished
dignitary
who
bore
the
title
of
collector
of
alms
went
round
to
all
the
brothers
pierre
would
have
liked
to
subscribe
all
he
had
but
fearing
that
it
might
look
like
pride
subscribed
the
same
amount
as
the
others
the
meeting
was
at
an
end
and
on
reaching
home
pierre
felt
as
if
he
had
returned
from
a
long
journey
on
which
he
had
spent
dozens
of
years
had
become
completely
changed
and
had
quite
left
behind
his
former
habits
and
way
of
life
chapter
v
the
day
after
he
had
been
received
into
the
lodge
pierre
was
sitting
at
home
reading
a
book
and
trying
to
fathom
the
significance
of
the
square
one
side
of
which
symbolized
god
another
moral
things
a
third
physical
things
and
the
fourth
a
combination
of
these
now
and
then
his
attention
wandered
from
the
book
and
the
square
and
he
formed
in
imagination
a
new
plan
of
life
on
the
previous
evening
at
the
lodge
he
had
heard
that
a
rumor
of
his
duel
had
reached
the
emperor
and
that
it
would
be
wiser
for
him
to
leave
petersburg
pierre
proposed
going
to
his
estates
in
the
south
and
there
attending
to
the
welfare
of
his
serfs
he
was
joyfully
planning
this
new
life
when
prince
vasili
suddenly
entered
the
room
my
dear
fellow
what
have
you
been
up
to
in
moscow
why
have
you
quarreled
with
helene
mon
cher
you
are
under
a
delusion
said
prince
vasili
as
he
entered
i
know
all
about
it
and
i
can
tell
you
positively
that
helene
is
as
innocent
before
you
as
christ
was
before
the
jews
pierre
was
about
to
reply
but
prince
vasili
interrupted
him
and
why
didn
t
you
simply
come
straight
to
me
as
to
a
friend
i
know
all
about
it
and
understand
it
all
he
said
you
behaved
as
becomes
a
man
who
values
his
honor
perhaps
too
hastily
but
we
won
t
go
into
that
but
consider
the
position
in
which
you
are
placing
her
and
me
in
the
eyes
of
society
and
even
of
the
court
he
added
lowering
his
voice
she
is
living
in
moscow
and
you
are
here
remember
dear
boy
and
he
drew
pierre
s
arm
downwards
it
is
simply
a
misunderstanding
i
expect
you
feel
it
so
yourself
let
us
write
her
a
letter
at
once
and
she
ll
come
here
and
all
will
be
explained
or
else
my
dear
boy
let
me
tell
you
it
s
quite
likely
you
ll
have
to
suffer
for
it
prince
vasili
gave
pierre
a
significant
look
i
know
from
reliable
sources
that
the
dowager
empress
is
taking
a
keen
interest
in
the
whole
affair
you
know
she
is
very
gracious
to
helene
pierre
tried
several
times
to
speak
but
on
one
hand
prince
vasili
did
not
let
him
and
on
the
other
pierre
himself
feared
to
begin
to
speak
in
the
tone
of
decided
refusal
and
disagreement
in
which
he
had
firmly
resolved
to
answer
his
father
in
law
moreover
the
words
of
the
masonic
statutes
be
kindly
and
courteous
recurred
to
him
he
blinked
went
red
got
up
and
sat
down
again
struggling
with
himself
to
do
what
was
for
him
the
most
difficult
thing
in
life
to
say
an
unpleasant
thing
to
a
man
s
face
to
say
what
the
other
whoever
he
might
be
did
not
expect
he
was
so
used
to
submitting
to
prince
vasili
s
tone
of
careless
self
assurance
that
he
felt
he
would
be
unable
to
withstand
it
now
but
he
also
felt
that
on
what
he
said
now
his
future
depended
whether
he
would
follow
the
same
old
road
or
that
new
path
so
attractively
shown
him
by
the
masons
on
which
he
firmly
believed
he
would
be
reborn
to
a
new
life
now
dear
boy
said
prince
vasili
playfully
say
yes
and
i
ll
write
to
her
myself
and
we
will
kill
the
fatted
calf
but
before
prince
vasili
had
finished
his
playful
speech
pierre
without
looking
at
him
and
with
a
kind
of
fury
that
made
him
like
his
father
muttered
in
a
whisper
prince
i
did
not
ask
you
here
go
please
go
and
he
jumped
up
and
opened
the
door
for
him
go
he
repeated
amazed
at
himself
and
glad
to
see
the
look
of
confusion
and
fear
that
showed
itself
on
prince
vasili
s
face
what
s
the
matter
with
you
are
you
ill
go
the
quivering
voice
repeated
and
prince
vasili
had
to
go
without
receiving
any
explanation
a
week
later
pierre
having
taken
leave
of
his
new
friends
the
masons
and
leaving
large
sums
of
money
with
them
for
alms
went
away
to
his
estates
his
new
brethren
gave
him
letters
to
the
kiev
and
odessa
masons
and
promised
to
write
to
him
and
guide
him
in
his
new
activity
chapter
vi
the
duel
between
pierre
and
dolokhov
was
hushed
up
and
in
spite
of
the
emperor
s
severity
regarding
duels
at
that
time
neither
the
principals
nor
their
seconds
suffered
for
it
but
the
story
of
the
duel
confirmed
by
pierre
s
rupture
with
his
wife
was
the
talk
of
society
pierre
who
had
been
regarded
with
patronizing
condescension
when
he
was
an
illegitimate
son
and
petted
and
extolled
when
he
was
the
best
match
in
russia
had
sunk
greatly
in
the
esteem
of
society
after
his
marriage
when
the
marriageable
daughters
and
their
mothers
had
nothing
to
hope
from
him
especially
as
he
did
not
know
how
and
did
not
wish
to
court
society
s
favor
now
he
alone
was
blamed
for
what
had
happened
he
was
said
to
be
insanely
jealous
and
subject
like
his
father
to
fits
of
bloodthirsty
rage
and
when
after
pierre
s
departure
helene
returned
to
petersburg
she
was
received
by
all
her
acquaintances
not
only
cordially
but
even
with
a
shade
of
deference
due
to
her
misfortune
when
conversation
turned
on
her
husband
helene
assumed
a
dignified
expression
which
with
characteristic
tact
she
had
acquired
though
she
did
not
understand
its
significance
this
expression
suggested
that
she
had
resolved
to
endure
her
troubles
uncomplainingly
and
that
her
husband
was
a
cross
laid
upon
her
by
god
prince
vasili
expressed
his
opinion
more
openly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
pierre
was
mentioned
and
pointing
to
his
forehead
remarked
a
bit
touched
i
always
said
so
i
said
from
the
first
declared
anna
pavlovna
referring
to
pierre
i
said
at
the
time
and
before
anyone
else
she
insisted
on
her
priority
that
that
senseless
young
man
was
spoiled
by
the
depraved
ideas
of
these
days
i
said
so
even
at
the
time
when
everybody
was
in
raptures
about
him
when
he
had
just
returned
from
abroad
and
when
if
you
remember
he
posed
as
a
sort
of
marat
at
one
of
my
soirees
and
how
has
it
ended
i
was
against
this
marriage
even
then
and
foretold
all
that
has
happened
anna
pavlovna
continued
to
give
on
free
evenings
the
same
kind
of
soirees
as
before
such
as
she
alone
had
the
gift
of
arranging
at
which
was
to
be
found
the
cream
of
really
good
society
the
bloom
of
the
intellectual
essence
of
petersburg
as
she
herself
put
it
besides
this
refined
selection
of
society
anna
pavlovna
s
receptions
were
also
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
she
always
presented
some
new
and
interesting
person
to
the
visitors
and
that
nowhere
else
was
the
state
of
the
political
thermometer
of
legitimate
petersburg
court
society
so
dearly
and
distinctly
indicated
toward
the
end
of
when
all
the
sad
details
of
napoleon
s
destruction
of
the
prussian
army
at
jena
and
auerstadt
and
the
surrender
of
most
of
the
prussian
fortresses
had
been
received
when
our
troops
had
already
entered
prussia
and
our
second
war
with
napoleon
was
beginning
anna
pavlovna
gave
one
of
her
soirees
the
cream
of
really
good
society
consisted
of
the
fascinating
helene
forsaken
by
her
husband
mortemart
the
delightful
prince
hippolyte
who
had
just
returned
from
vienna
two
diplomatists
the
old
aunt
a
young
man
referred
to
in
that
drawing
room
as
a
man
of
great
merit
un
homme
de
beaucoup

a
newly
appointed
maid
of
honor
and
her
mother
and
several
other
less
noteworthy
persons
the
novelty
anna
pavlovna
was
setting
before
her
guests
that
evening
was
boris
drubetskoy
who
had
just
arrived
as
a
special
messenger
from
the
prussian
army
and
was
aide
de
camp
to
a
very
important
personage
the
temperature
shown
by
the
political
thermometer
to
the
company
that
evening
was
this
whatever
the
european
sovereigns
and
commanders
may
do
to
countenance
bonaparte
and
to
cause
me
and
us
in
general
annoyance
and
mortification
our
opinion
of
bonaparte
cannot
alter
we
shall
not
cease
to
express
our
sincere
views
on
that
subject
and
can
only
say
to
the
king
of
prussia
and
others
so
much
the
worse
for
you
tu
l
as
voulu
george
dandin
that
s
all
we
have
to
say
about
it
when
boris
who
was
to
be
served
up
to
the
guests
entered
the
drawing
room
almost
all
the
company
had
assembled
and
the
conversation
guided
by
anna
pavlovna
was
about
our
diplomatic
relations
with
austria
and
the
hope
of
an
alliance
with
her
boris
grown
more
manly
and
looking
fresh
rosy
and
self
possessed
entered
the
drawing
room
elegantly
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
an
aide
de
camp
and
was
duly
conducted
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
aunt
and
then
brought
back
to
the
general
circle
anna
pavlovna
gave
him
her
shriveled
hand
to
kiss
and
introduced
him
to
several
persons
whom
he
did
not
know
giving
him
a
whispered
description
of
each
prince
hippolyte

charming
young
fellow
m

charge
d

from
copenhagen
a
profound
intellect
and
simply
mr

a
man
of
great
merit
this
of
the
man
usually
so
described
thanks
to
anna
mikhaylovna
s
efforts
his
own
tastes
and
the
peculiarities
of
his
reserved
nature
boris
had
managed
during
his
service
to
place
himself
very
advantageously
he
was
aide
de
camp
to
a
very
important
personage
had
been
sent
on
a
very
important
mission
to
prussia
and
had
just
returned
from
there
as
a
special
messenger
he
had
become
thoroughly
conversant
with
that
unwritten
code
with
which
he
had
been
so
pleased
at
olmutz
and
according
to
which
an
ensign
might
rank
incomparably
higher
than
a
general
and
according
to
which
what
was
needed
for
success
in
the
service
was
not
effort
or
work
or
courage
or
perseverance
but
only
the
knowledge
of
how
to
get
on
with
those
who
can
grant
rewards
and
he
was
himself
often
surprised
at
the
rapidity
of
his
success
and
at
the
inability
of
others
to
understand
these
things
in
consequence
of
this
discovery
his
whole
manner
of
life
all
his
relations
with
old
friends
all
his
plans
for
his
future
were
completely
altered
he
was
not
rich
but
would
spend
his
last
groat
to
be
better
dressed
than
others
and
would
rather
deprive
himself
of
many
pleasures
than
allow
himself
to
be
seen
in
a
shabby
equipage
or
appear
in
the
streets
of
petersburg
in
an
old
uniform
he
made
friends
with
and
sought
the
acquaintance
of
only
those
above
him
in
position
and
who
could
therefore
be
of
use
to
him
he
liked
petersburg
and
despised
moscow
the
remembrance
of
the
rostovs
house
and
of
his
childish
love
for
natasha
was
unpleasant
to
him
and
he
had
not
once
been
to
see
the
rostovs
since
the
day
of
his
departure
for
the
army
to
be
in
anna
pavlovna
s
drawing
room
he
considered
an
important
step
up
in
the
service
and
he
at
once
understood
his
role
letting
his
hostess
make
use
of
whatever
interest
he
had
to
offer
he
himself
carefully
scanned
each
face
appraising
the
possibilities
of
establishing
intimacy
with
each
of
those
present
and
the
advantages
that
might
accrue
he
took
the
seat
indicated
to
him
beside
the
fair
helene
and
listened
to
the
general
conversation
vienna
considers
the
bases
of
the
proposed
treaty
so
unattainable
that
not
even
a
continuity
of
most
brilliant
successes
would
secure
them
and
she
doubts
the
means
we
have
of
gaining
them
that
is
the
actual
phrase
used
by
the
vienna
cabinet
said
the
danish
charge
d
affaires
the
doubt
is
flattering
said
the
man
of
profound
intellect
with
a
subtle
smile
we
must
distinguish
between
the
vienna
cabinet
and
the
emperor
of
austria
said
mortemart
the
emperor
of
austria
can
never
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
it
is
only
the
cabinet
that
says
it
ah
my
dear
vicomte
put
in
anna
pavlovna
l
urope
for
some
reason
she
called
it
urope
as
if
that
were
a
specially
refined
french
pronunciation
which
she
could
allow
herself
when
conversing
with
a
frenchman
l
urope
ne
sera
jamais
notre
alliee
sincere
europe
will
never
be
our
sincere
ally
after
that
anna
pavlovna
led
up
to
the
courage
and
firmness
of
the
king
of
prussia
in
order
to
draw
boris
into
the
conversation
boris
listened
attentively
to
each
of
the
speakers
awaiting
his
turn
but
managed
meanwhile
to
look
round
repeatedly
at
his
neighbor
the
beautiful
helene
whose
eyes
several
times
met
those
of
the
handsome
young
aide
de
camp
with
a
smile
speaking
of
the
position
of
prussia
anna
pavlovna
very
naturally
asked
boris
to
tell
them
about
his
journey
to
glogau
and
in
what
state
he
found
the
prussian
army
boris
speaking
with
deliberation
told
them
in
pure
correct
french
many
interesting
details
about
the
armies
and
the
court
carefully
abstaining
from
expressing
an
opinion
of
his
own
about
the
facts
he
was
recounting
for
some
time
he
engrossed
the
general
attention
and
anna
pavlovna
felt
that
the
novelty
she
had
served
up
was
received
with
pleasure
by
all
her
visitors
the
greatest
attention
of
all
to
boris
narrative
was
shown
by
helene
she
asked
him
several
questions
about
his
journey
and
seemed
greatly
interested
in
the
state
of
the
prussian
army
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
she
turned
to
him
with
her
usual
smile
you
absolutely
must
come
and
see
me
she
said
in
a
tone
that
implied
that
for
certain
considerations
he
could
not
know
of
this
was
absolutely
necessary
on
tuesday
between
eight
and
nine
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
boris
promised
to
fulfill
her
wish
and
was
about
to
begin
a
conversation
with
her
when
anna
pavlovna
called
him
away
on
the
pretext
that
her
aunt
wished
to
hear
him
you
know
her
husband
of
course
said
anna
pavlovna
closing
her
eyes
and
indicating
helene
with
a
sorrowful
gesture
ah
she
is
such
an
unfortunate
and
charming
woman
don
t
mention
him
before
her
please
don
t
it
is
too
painful
for
her
chapter
vii
when
boris
and
anna
pavlovna
returned
to
the
others
prince
hippolyte
had
the
ear
of
the
company
bending
forward
in
his
armchair
he
said
le
roi
de
prusse
and
having
said
this
laughed
everyone
turned
toward
him
le
roi
de
prusse
hippolyte
said
interrogatively
again
laughing
and
then
calmly
and
seriously
sat
back
in
his
chair
anna
pavlovna
waited
for
him
to
go
on
but
as
he
seemed
quite
decided
to
say
no
more
she
began
to
tell
of
how
at
potsdam
the
impious
bonaparte
had
stolen
the
sword
of
frederick
the
great
it
is
the
sword
of
frederick
the
great
which
i
she
began
but
hippolyte
interrupted
her
with
the
words
le
roi
de
prusse
and
again
as
soon
as
all
turned
toward
him
excused
himself
and
said
no
more
anna
pavlovna
frowned
mortemart
hippolyte
s
friend
addressed
him
firmly
come
now
what
about
your
roi
de
prusse
hippolyte
laughed
as
if
ashamed
of
laughing
oh
it
s
nothing
i
only
wished
to
say
he
wanted
to
repeat
a
joke
he
had
heard
in
vienna
and
which
he
had
been
trying
all
that
evening
to
get
in
i
only
wished
to
say
that
we
are
wrong
to
fight
pour
le
roi
de
prusse
boris
smiled
circumspectly
so
that
it
might
be
taken
as
ironical
or
appreciative
according
to
the
way
the
joke
was
received
everybody
laughed
your
joke
is
too
bad
it
s
witty
but
unjust
said
anna
pavlovna
shaking
her
little
shriveled
finger
at
him
we
are
not
fighting
pour
le
roi
de
prusse
but
for
right
principles
oh
that
wicked
prince
hippolyte
she
said
the
conversation
did
not
flag
all
evening
and
turned
chiefly
on
the
political
news
it
became
particularly
animated
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
when
the
rewards
bestowed
by
the
emperor
were
mentioned
you
know
n
n
received
a
snuffbox
with
the
portrait
last
year
said
the
man
of
profound
intellect
why
shouldn
t
s
s
get
the
same
distinction
pardon
me
a
snuffbox
with
the
emperor
s
portrait
is
a
reward
but
not
a
distinction
said
the
diplomatist
a
gift
rather
there
are
precedents
i
may
mention
schwarzenberg
it
s
impossible
replied
another
will
you
bet
the
ribbon
of
the
order
is
a
different
matter
when
everybody
rose
to
go
helene
who
had
spoken
very
little
all
the
evening
again
turned
to
boris
asking
him
in
a
tone
of
caressing
significant
command
to
come
to
her
on
tuesday
it
is
of
great
importance
to
me
she
said
turning
with
a
smile
toward
anna
pavlovna
and
anna
pavlovna
with
the
same
sad
smile
with
which
she
spoke
of
her
exalted
patroness
supported
helene
s
wish
it
seemed
as
if
from
some
words
boris
had
spoken
that
evening
about
the
prussian
army
helene
had
suddenly
found
it
necessary
to
see
him
she
seemed
to
promise
to
explain
that
necessity
to
him
when
he
came
on
tuesday
but
on
tuesday
evening
having
come
to
helene
s
splendid
salon
boris
received
no
clear
explanation
of
why
it
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
come
there
were
other
guests
and
the
countess
talked
little
to
him
and
only
as
he
kissed
her
hand
on
taking
leave
said
unexpectedly
and
in
a
whisper
with
a
strangely
unsmiling
face
come
to
dinner
tomorrow
in
the
evening
you
must
come
come
during
that
stay
in
petersburg
boris
became
an
intimate
in
the
countess
house
chapter
viii
the
war
was
flaming
up
and
nearing
the
russian
frontier
everywhere
one
heard
curses
on
bonaparte
the
enemy
of
mankind
militiamen
and
recruits
were
being
enrolled
in
the
villages
and
from
the
seat
of
war
came
contradictory
news
false
as
usual
and
therefore
variously
interpreted
the
life
of
old
prince
bolkonski
prince
andrew
and
princess
mary
had
greatly
changed
since
in
the
old
prince
was
made
one
of
the
eight
commanders
in
chief
then
appointed
to
supervise
the
enrollment
decreed
throughout
russia
despite
the
weakness
of
age
which
had
become
particularly
noticeable
since
the
time
when
he
thought
his
son
had
been
killed
he
did
not
think
it
right
to
refuse
a
duty
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
by
the
emperor
himself
and
this
fresh
opportunity
for
action
gave
him
new
energy
and
strength
he
was
continually
traveling
through
the
three
provinces
entrusted
to
him
was
pedantic
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
duties
severe
to
cruel
with
his
subordinates
and
went
into
everything
down
to
the
minutest
details
himself
princess
mary
had
ceased
taking
lessons
in
mathematics
from
her
father
and
when
the
old
prince
was
at
home
went
to
his
study
with
the
wet
nurse
and
little
prince
nicholas
as
his
grandfather
called
him
the
baby
prince
nicholas
lived
with
his
wet
nurse
and
nurse
savishna
in
the
late
princess
rooms
and
princess
mary
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
nursery
taking
a
mother
s
place
to
her
little
nephew
as
best
she
could
mademoiselle
bourienne
too
seemed
passionately
fond
of
the
boy
and
princess
mary
often
deprived
herself
to
give
her
friend
the
pleasure
of
dandling
the
little
angel
as
she
called
her
nephew
and
playing
with
him
near
the
altar
of
the
church
at
bald
hills
there
was
a
chapel
over
the
tomb
of
the
little
princess
and
in
this
chapel
was
a
marble
monument
brought
from
italy
representing
an
angel
with
outspread
wings
ready
to
fly
upwards
the
angel
s
upper
lip
was
slightly
raised
as
though
about
to
smile
and
once
on
coming
out
of
the
chapel
prince
andrew
and
princess
mary
admitted
to
one
another
that
the
angel
s
face
reminded
them
strangely
of
the
little
princess
but
what
was
still
stranger
though
of
this
prince
andrew
said
nothing
to
his
sister
was
that
in
the
expression
the
sculptor
had
happened
to
give
the
angel
s
face
prince
andrew
read
the
same
mild
reproach
he
had
read
on
the
face
of
his
dead
wife
ah
why
have
you
done
this
to
me
soon
after
prince
andrew
s
return
the
old
prince
made
over
to
him
a
large
estate
bogucharovo
about
twenty
five
miles
from
bald
hills
partly
because
of
the
depressing
memories
associated
with
bald
hills
partly
because
prince
andrew
did
not
always
feel
equal
to
bearing
with
his
father
s
peculiarities
and
partly
because
he
needed
solitude
prince
andrew
made
use
of
bogucharovo
began
building
and
spent
most
of
his
time
there
after
the
austerlitz
campaign
prince
andrew
had
firmly
resolved
not
to
continue
his
military
service
and
when
the
war
recommenced
and
everybody
had
to
serve
he
took
a
post
under
his
father
in
the
recruitment
so
as
to
avoid
active
service
the
old
prince
and
his
son
seemed
to
have
changed
roles
since
the
campaign
of
the
old
man
roused
by
activity
expected
the
best
results
from
the
new
campaign
while
prince
andrew
on
the
contrary
taking
no
part
in
the
war
and
secretly
regretting
this
saw
only
the
dark
side
on
february
the
old
prince
set
off
on
one
of
his
circuits
prince
andrew
remained
at
bald
hills
as
usual
during
his
father
s
absence
little
nicholas
had
been
unwell
for
four
days
the
coachman
who
had
driven
the
old
prince
to
town
returned
bringing
papers
and
letters
for
prince
andrew
not
finding
the
young
prince
in
his
study
the
valet
went
with
the
letters
to
princess
mary
s
apartments
but
did
not
find
him
there
he
was
told
that
the
prince
had
gone
to
the
nursery
if
you
please
your
excellency
petrusha
has
brought
some
papers
said
one
of
the
nursemaids
to
prince
andrew
who
was
sitting
on
a
child
s
little
chair
while
frowning
and
with
trembling
hands
he
poured
drops
from
a
medicine
bottle
into
a
wineglass
half
full
of
water
what
is
it
he
said
crossly
and
his
hand
shaking
unintentionally
he
poured
too
many
drops
into
the
glass
he
threw
the
mixture
onto
the
floor
and
asked
for
some
more
water
the
maid
brought
it
there
were
in
the
room
a
child
s
cot
two
boxes
two
armchairs
a
table
a
child
s
table
and
the
little
chair
on
which
prince
andrew
was
sitting
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
a
single
candle
was
burning
on
the
table
screened
by
a
bound
music
book
so
that
the
light
did
not
fall
on
the
cot
my
dear
said
princess
mary
addressing
her
brother
from
beside
the
cot
where
she
was
standing
better
wait
a
bit
later
oh
leave
off
you
always
talk
nonsense
and
keep
putting
things
off
and
this
is
what
comes
of
it
said
prince
andrew
in
an
exasperated
whisper
evidently
meaning
to
wound
his
sister
my
dear
really
it
s
better
not
to
wake
him
he
s
asleep
said
the
princess
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
prince
andrew
got
up
and
went
on
tiptoe
up
to
the
little
bed
wineglass
in
hand
perhaps
we
d
really
better
not
wake
him
he
said
hesitating
as
you
please
really
i
think
so
but
as
you
please
said
princess
mary
evidently
intimidated
and
confused
that
her
opinion
had
prevailed
she
drew
her
brother
s
attention
to
the
maid
who
was
calling
him
in
a
whisper
it
was
the
second
night
that
neither
of
them
had
slept
watching
the
boy
who
was
in
a
high
fever
these
last
days
mistrusting
their
household
doctor
and
expecting
another
for
whom
they
had
sent
to
town
they
had
been
trying
first
one
remedy
and
then
another
worn
out
by
sleeplessness
and
anxiety
they
threw
their
burden
of
sorrow
on
one
another
and
reproached
and
disputed
with
each
other
petrusha
has
come
with
papers
from
your
father
whispered
the
maid
prince
andrew
went
out
devil
take
them
he
muttered
and
after
listening
to
the
verbal
instructions
his
father
had
sent
and
taking
the
correspondence
and
his
father
s
letter
he
returned
to
the
nursery
well
he
asked
still
the
same
wait
for
heaven
s
sake
karl
ivanich
always
says
that
sleep
is
more
important
than
anything
whispered
princess
mary
with
a
sigh
prince
andrew
went
up
to
the
child
and
felt
him
he
was
burning
hot
confound
you
and
your
karl
ivanich
he
took
the
glass
with
the
drops
and
again
went
up
to
the
cot
andrew
don
t
said
princess
mary
but
he
scowled
at
her
angrily
though
also
with
suffering
in
his
eyes
and
stooped
glass
in
hand
over
the
infant
but
i
wish
it
he
said
i
beg
you
give
it
him
princess
mary
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
took
the
glass
submissively
and
calling
the
nurse
began
giving
the
medicine
the
child
screamed
hoarsely
prince
andrew
winced
and
clutching
his
head
went
out
and
sat
down
on
a
sofa
in
the
next
room
he
still
had
all
the
letters
in
his
hand
opening
them
mechanically
he
began
reading
the
old
prince
now
and
then
using
abbreviations
wrote
in
his
large
elongated
hand
on
blue
paper
as
follows
have
just
this
moment
received
by
special
messenger
very
joyful
news
if
it
s
not
false
bennigsen
seems
to
have
obtained
a
complete
victory
over
buonaparte
at
eylau
in
petersburg
everyone
is
rejoicing
and
the
rewards
sent
to
the
army
are
innumerable
though
he
is
a
german
i
congratulate
him
i
can
t
make
out
what
the
commander
at
korchevo
a
certain
khandrikov
is
up
to
till
now
the
additional
men
and
provisions
have
not
arrived
gallop
off
to
him
at
once
and
say
i
ll
have
his
head
off
if
everything
is
not
here
in
a
week
have
received
another
letter
about
the
preussisch
eylau
battle
from
petenka
he
took
part
in
it
and
it
s
all
true
when
mischief
makers
don
t
meddle
even
a
german
beats
buonaparte
he
is
said
to
be
fleeing
in
great
disorder
mind
you
gallop
off
to
korchevo
without
delay
and
carry
out
instructions
prince
andrew
sighed
and
broke
the
seal
of
another
envelope
it
was
a
closely
written
letter
of
two
sheets
from
bilibin
he
folded
it
up
without
reading
it
and
reread
his
father
s
letter
ending
with
the
words
gallop
off
to
korchevo
and
carry
out
instructions
no
pardon
me
i
won
t
go
now
till
the
child
is
better
thought
he
going
to
the
door
and
looking
into
the
nursery
princess
mary
was
still
standing
by
the
cot
gently
rocking
the
baby
ah
yes
and
what
else
did
he
say
that
s
unpleasant
thought
prince
andrew
recalling
his
father
s
letter
yes
we
have
gained
a
victory
over
bonaparte
just
when
i
m
not
serving
yes
yes
he
s
always
poking
fun
at
me
ah
well
let
him
and
he
began
reading
bilibin
s
letter
which
was
written
in
french
he
read
without
understanding
half
of
it
read
only
to
forget
if
but
for
a
moment
what
he
had
too
long
been
thinking
of
so
painfully
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
chapter
ix
bilibin
was
now
at
army
headquarters
in
a
diplomatic
capacity
and
though
he
wrote
in
french
and
used
french
jests
and
french
idioms
he
described
the
whole
campaign
with
a
fearless
self
censure
and
self
derision
genuinely
russian
bilibin
wrote
that
the
obligation
of
diplomatic
discretion
tormented
him
and
he
was
happy
to
have
in
prince
andrew
a
reliable
correspondent
to
whom
he
could
pour
out
the
bile
he
had
accumulated
at
the
sight
of
all
that
was
being
done
in
the
army
the
letter
was
old
having
been
written
before
the
battle
at
preussisch
eylau
since
the
day
of
our
brilliant
success
at
austerlitz
wrote
bilibin
as
you
know
my
dear
prince
i
never
leave
headquarters
i
have
certainly
acquired
a
taste
for
war
and
it
is
just
as
well
for
me
what
i
have
seen
during
these
last
three
months
is
incredible
i
begin
ab
ovo
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
as
you
know
attacks
the
prussians
the
prussians
are
our
faithful
allies
who
have
only
betrayed
us
three
times
in
three
years
we
take
up
their
cause
but
it
turns
out
that
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
pays
no
heed
to
our
fine
speeches
and
in
his
rude
and
savage
way
throws
himself
on
the
prussians
without
giving
them
time
to
finish
the
parade
they
had
begun
and
in
two
twists
of
the
hand
he
breaks
them
to
smithereens
and
installs
himself
in
the
palace
at
potsdam
i
most
ardently
desire
writes
the
king
of
prussia
to
bonaparte
that
your
majesty
should
be
received
and
treated
in
my
palace
in
a
manner
agreeable
to
yourself
and
in
so
far
as
circumstances
allowed
i
have
hastened
to
take
all
steps
to
that
end
may
i
have
succeeded
the
prussian
generals
pride
themselves
on
being
polite
to
the
french
and
lay
down
their
arms
at
the
first
demand
the
head
of
the
garrison
at
glogau
with
ten
thousand
men
asks
the
king
of
prussia
what
he
is
to
do
if
he
is
summoned
to
surrender
all
this
is
absolutely
true
in
short
hoping
to
settle
matters
by
taking
up
a
warlike
attitude
it
turns
out
that
we
have
landed
ourselves
in
war
and
what
is
more
in
war
on
our
own
frontiers
with
and
for
the
king
of
prussia
we
have
everything
in
perfect
order
only
one
little
thing
is
lacking
namely
a
commander
in
chief
as
it
was
considered
that
the
austerlitz
success
might
have
been
more
decisive
had
the
commander
in
chief
not
been
so
young
all
our
octogenarians
were
reviewed
and
of
prozorovski
and
kamenski
the
latter
was
preferred
the
general
comes
to
us
suvorov
like
in
a
kibitka
and
is
received
with
acclamations
of
joy
and
triumph
on
the
th
the
first
courier
arrives
from
petersburg
the
mails
are
taken
to
the
field
marshal
s
room
for
he
likes
to
do
everything
himself
i
am
called
in
to
help
sort
the
letters
and
take
those
meant
for
us
the
field
marshal
looks
on
and
waits
for
letters
addressed
to
him
we
search
but
none
are
to
be
found
the
field
marshal
grows
impatient
and
sets
to
work
himself
and
finds
letters
from
the
emperor
to
count
t
prince
v
and
others
then
he
bursts
into
one
of
his
wild
furies
and
rages
at
everyone
and
everything
seizes
the
letters
opens
them
and
reads
those
from
the
emperor
addressed
to
others
ah
so
that
s
the
way
they
treat
me
no
confidence
in
me
ah
ordered
to
keep
an
eye
on
me
very
well
then
get
along
with
you
so
he
writes
the
famous
order
of
the
day
to
general
bennigsen
i
am
wounded
and
cannot
ride
and
consequently
cannot
command
the
army
you
have
brought
your
army
corps
to
pultusk
routed
here
it
is
exposed
and
without
fuel
or
forage
so
something
must
be
done
and
as
you
yourself
reported
to
count
buxhowden
yesterday
you
must
think
of
retreating
to
our
frontier
which
do
today
from
all
my
riding
he
writes
to
the
emperor
i
have
got
a
saddle
sore
which
coming
after
all
my
previous
journeys
quite
prevents
my
riding
and
commanding
so
vast
an
army
so
i
have
passed
on
the
command
to
the
general
next
in
seniority
count
buxhowden
having
sent
him
my
whole
staff
and
all
that
belongs
to
it
advising
him
if
there
is
a
lack
of
bread
to
move
farther
into
the
interior
of
prussia
for
only
one
day
s
ration
of
bread
remains
and
in
some
regiments
none
at
all
as
reported
by
the
division
commanders
ostermann
and
sedmoretzki
and
all
that
the
peasants
had
has
been
eaten
up
i
myself
will
remain
in
hospital
at
ostrolenka
till
i
recover
in
regard
to
which
i
humbly
submit
my
report
with
the
information
that
if
the
army
remains
in
its
present
bivouac
another
fortnight
there
will
not
be
a
healthy
man
left
in
it
by
spring
grant
leave
to
retire
to
his
country
seat
to
an
old
man
who
is
already
in
any
case
dishonored
by
being
unable
to
fulfill
the
great
and
glorious
task
for
which
he
was
chosen
i
shall
await
your
most
gracious
permission
here
in
hospital
that
i
may
not
have
to
play
the
part
of
a
secretary
rather
than
commander
in
the
army
my
removal
from
the
army
does
not
produce
the
slightest
stir
a
blind
man
has
left
it
there
are
thousands
such
as
i
in
russia
the
field
marshal
is
angry
with
the
emperor
and
he
punishes
us
all
isn
t
it
logical
this
is
the
first
act
those
that
follow
are
naturally
increasingly
interesting
and
entertaining
after
the
field
marshal
s
departure
it
appears
that
we
are
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
must
give
battle
buxhowden
is
commander
in
chief
by
seniority
but
general
bennigsen
does
not
quite
see
it
more
particularly
as
it
is
he
and
his
corps
who
are
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
he
wishes
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
to
fight
a
battle
on
his
own
hand
as
the
germans
say
he
does
so
this
is
the
battle
of
pultusk
which
is
considered
a
great
victory
but
in
my
opinion
was
nothing
of
the
kind
we
civilians
as
you
know
have
a
very
bad
way
of
deciding
whether
a
battle
was
won
or
lost
those
who
retreat
after
a
battle
have
lost
it
is
what
we
say
and
according
to
that
it
is
we
who
lost
the
battle
of
pultusk
in
short
we
retreat
after
the
battle
but
send
a
courier
to
petersburg
with
news
of
a
victory
and
general
bennigsen
hoping
to
receive
from
petersburg
the
post
of
commander
in
chief
as
a
reward
for
his
victory
does
not
give
up
the
command
of
the
army
to
general
buxhowden
during
this
interregnum
we
begin
a
very
original
and
interesting
series
of
maneuvers
our
aim
is
no
longer
as
it
should
be
to
avoid
or
attack
the
enemy
but
solely
to
avoid
general
buxhowden
who
by
right
of
seniority
should
be
our
chief
so
energetically
do
we
pursue
this
aim
that
after
crossing
an
unfordable
river
we
burn
the
bridges
to
separate
ourselves
from
our
enemy
who
at
the
moment
is
not
bonaparte
but
buxhowden
general
buxhowden
was
all
but
attacked
and
captured
by
a
superior
enemy
force
as
a
result
of
one
of
these
maneuvers
that
enabled
us
to
escape
him
buxhowden
pursues
us
we
scuttle
he
hardly
crosses
the
river
to
our
side
before
we
recross
to
the
other
at
last
our
enemy
buxhowden
catches
us
and
attacks
both
generals
are
angry
and
the
result
is
a
challenge
on
buxhowden
s
part
and
an
epileptic
fit
on
bennigsen
s
but
at
the
critical
moment
the
courier
who
carried
the
news
of
our
victory
at
pultusk
to
petersburg
returns
bringing
our
appointment
as
commander
in
chief
and
our
first
foe
buxhowden
is
vanquished
we
can
now
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
second
bonaparte
but
as
it
turns
out
just
at
that
moment
a
third
enemy
rises
before
us
namely
the
orthodox
russian
soldiers
loudly
demanding
bread
meat
biscuits
fodder
and
whatnot
the
stores
are
empty
the
roads
impassable
the
orthodox
begin
looting
and
in
a
way
of
which
our
last
campaign
can
give
you
no
idea
half
the
regiments
form
bands
and
scour
the
countryside
and
put
everything
to
fire
and
sword
the
inhabitants
are
totally
ruined
the
hospitals
overflow
with
sick
and
famine
is
everywhere
twice
the
marauders
even
attack
our
headquarters
and
the
commander
in
chief
has
to
ask
for
a
battalion
to
disperse
them
during
one
of
these
attacks
they
carried
off
my
empty
portmanteau
and
my
dressing
gown
the
emperor
proposes
to
give
all
commanders
of
divisions
the
right
to
shoot
marauders
but
i
much
fear
this
will
oblige
one
half
the
army
to
shoot
the
other
at
first
prince
andrew
read
with
his
eyes
only
but
after
a
while
in
spite
of
himself
although
he
knew
how
far
it
was
safe
to
trust
bilibin
what
he
had
read
began
to
interest
him
more
and
more
when
he
had
read
thus
far
he
crumpled
the
letter
up
and
threw
it
away
it
was
not
what
he
had
read
that
vexed
him
but
the
fact
that
the
life
out
there
in
which
he
had
now
no
part
could
perturb
him
he
shut
his
eyes
rubbed
his
forehead
as
if
to
rid
himself
of
all
interest
in
what
he
had
read
and
listened
to
what
was
passing
in
the
nursery
suddenly
he
thought
he
heard
a
strange
noise
through
the
door
he
was
seized
with
alarm
lest
something
should
have
happened
to
the
child
while
he
was
reading
the
letter
he
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
nursery
door
and
opened
it
just
as
he
went
in
he
saw
that
the
nurse
was
hiding
something
from
him
with
a
scared
look
and
that
princess
mary
was
no
longer
by
the
cot
my
dear
he
heard
what
seemed
to
him
her
despairing
whisper
behind
him
as
often
happens
after
long
sleeplessness
and
long
anxiety
he
was
seized
by
an
unreasoning
panic
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
child
was
dead
all
that
he
saw
and
heard
seemed
to
confirm
this
terror
all
is
over
he
thought
and
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
he
went
to
the
cot
in
confusion
sure
that
he
would
find
it
empty
and
that
the
nurse
had
been
hiding
the
dead
baby
he
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
for
some
time
his
frightened
restless
eyes
could
not
find
the
baby
at
last
he
saw
him
the
rosy
boy
had
tossed
about
till
he
lay
across
the
bed
with
his
head
lower
than
the
pillow
and
was
smacking
his
lips
in
his
sleep
and
breathing
evenly
prince
andrew
was
as
glad
to
find
the
boy
like
that
as
if
he
had
already
lost
him
he
bent
over
him
and
as
his
sister
had
taught
him
tried
with
his
lips
whether
the
child
was
still
feverish
the
soft
forehead
was
moist
prince
andrew
touched
the
head
with
his
hand
even
the
hair
was
wet
so
profusely
had
the
child
perspired
he
was
not
dead
but
evidently
the
crisis
was
over
and
he
was
convalescent
prince
andrew
longed
to
snatch
up
to
squeeze
to
hold
to
his
heart
this
helpless
little
creature
but
dared
not
do
so
he
stood
over
him
gazing
at
his
head
and
at
the
little
arms
and
legs
which
showed
under
the
blanket
he
heard
a
rustle
behind
him
and
a
shadow
appeared
under
the
curtain
of
the
cot
he
did
not
look
round
but
still
gazing
at
the
infant
s
face
listened
to
his
regular
breathing
the
dark
shadow
was
princess
mary
who
had
come
up
to
the
cot
with
noiseless
steps
lifted
the
curtain
and
dropped
it
again
behind
her
prince
andrew
recognized
her
without
looking
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
she
pressed
it
he
has
perspired
said
prince
andrew
i
was
coming
to
tell
you
so
the
child
moved
slightly
in
his
sleep
smiled
and
rubbed
his
forehead
against
the
pillow
prince
andrew
looked
at
his
sister
in
the
dim
shadow
of
the
curtain
her
luminous
eyes
shone
more
brightly
than
usual
from
the
tears
of
joy
that
were
in
them
she
leaned
over
to
her
brother
and
kissed
him
slightly
catching
the
curtain
of
the
cot
each
made
the
other
a
warning
gesture
and
stood
still
in
the
dim
light
beneath
the
curtain
as
if
not
wishing
to
leave
that
seclusion
where
they
three
were
shut
off
from
all
the
world
prince
andrew
was
the
first
to
move
away
ruffling
his
hair
against
the
muslin
of
the
curtain
yes
this
is
the
one
thing
left
me
now
he
said
with
a
sigh
chapter
x
soon
after
his
admission
to
the
masonic
brotherhood
pierre
went
to
the
kiev
province
where
he
had
the
greatest
number
of
serfs
taking
with
him
full
directions
which
he
had
written
down
for
his
own
guidance
as
to
what
he
should
do
on
his
estates
when
he
reached
kiev
he
sent
for
all
his
stewards
to
the
head
office
and
explained
to
them
his
intentions
and
wishes
he
told
them
that
steps
would
be
taken
immediately
to
free
his
serfs
and
that
till
then
they
were
not
to
be
overburdened
with
labor
women
while
nursing
their
babies
were
not
to
be
sent
to
work
assistance
was
to
be
given
to
the
serfs
punishments
were
to
be
admonitory
and
not
corporal
and
hospitals
asylums
and
schools
were
to
be
established
on
all
the
estates
some
of
the
stewards
there
were
semiliterate
foremen
among
them
listened
with
alarm
supposing
these
words
to
mean
that
the
young
count
was
displeased
with
their
management
and
embezzlement
of
money
some
after
their
first
fright
were
amused
by
pierre
s
lisp
and
the
new
words
they
had
not
heard
before
others
simply
enjoyed
hearing
how
the
master
talked
while
the
cleverest
among
them
including
the
chief
steward
understood
from
this
speech
how
they
could
best
handle
the
master
for
their
own
ends
the
chief
steward
expressed
great
sympathy
with
pierre
s
intentions
but
remarked
that
besides
these
changes
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
into
the
general
state
of
affairs
which
was
far
from
satisfactory
despite
count
bezukhov
s
enormous
wealth
since
he
had
come
into
an
income
which
was
said
to
amount
to
five
hundred
thousand
rubles
a
year
pierre
felt
himself
far
poorer
than
when
his
father
had
made
him
an
allowance
of
ten
thousand
rubles
he
had
a
dim
perception
of
the
following
budget
about
went
in
payments
on
all
the
estates
to
the
land
bank
about
went
for
the
upkeep
of
the
estate
near
moscow
the
town
house
and
the
allowance
to
the
three
princesses
about
was
given
in
pensions
and
the
same
amount
for
asylums
alimony
was
sent
to
the
countess
about
went
for
interest
on
debts
the
building
of
a
new
church
previously
begun
had
cost
about
in
each
of
the
last
two
years
and
he
did
not
know
how
the
rest
about
rubles
was
spent
and
almost
every
year
he
was
obliged
to
borrow
besides
this
the
chief
steward
wrote
every
year
telling
him
of
fires
and
bad
harvests
or
of
the
necessity
of
rebuilding
factories
and
workshops
so
the
first
task
pierre
had
to
face
was
one
for
which
he
had
very
little
aptitude
or
inclination
practical
business
he
discussed
estate
affairs
every
day
with
his
chief
steward
but
he
felt
that
this
did
not
forward
matters
at
all
he
felt
that
these
consultations
were
detached
from
real
affairs
and
did
not
link
up
with
them
or
make
them
move
on
the
one
hand
the
chief
steward
put
the
state
of
things
to
him
in
the
very
worst
light
pointing
out
the
necessity
of
paying
off
the
debts
and
undertaking
new
activities
with
serf
labor
to
which
pierre
did
not
agree
on
the
other
hand
pierre
demanded
that
steps
should
be
taken
to
liberate
the
serfs
which
the
steward
met
by
showing
the
necessity
of
first
paying
off
the
loans
from
the
land
bank
and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
a
speedy
emancipation
the
steward
did
not
say
it
was
quite
impossible
but
suggested
selling
the
forests
in
the
province
of
kostroma
the
land
lower
down
the
river
and
the
crimean
estate
in
order
to
make
it
possible
all
of
which
operations
according
to
him
were
connected
with
such
complicated
measures
the
removal
of
injunctions
petitions
permits
and
so
on
that
pierre
became
quite
bewildered
and
only
replied
yes
yes
do
so
pierre
had
none
of
the
practical
persistence
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
attend
to
the
business
himself
and
so
he
disliked
it
and
only
tried
to
pretend
to
the
steward
that
he
was
attending
to
it
the
steward
for
his
part
tried
to
pretend
to
the
count
that
he
considered
these
consultations
very
valuable
for
the
proprietor
and
troublesome
to
himself
in
kiev
pierre
found
some
people
he
knew
and
strangers
hastened
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
joyfully
welcomed
the
rich
newcomer
the
largest
landowner
of
the
province
temptations
to
pierre
s
greatest
weakness
the
one
to
which
he
had
confessed
when
admitted
to
the
lodge
were
so
strong
that
he
could
not
resist
them
again
whole
days
weeks
and
months
of
his
life
passed
in
as
great
a
rush
and
were
as
much
occupied
with
evening
parties
dinners
lunches
and
balls
giving
him
no
time
for
reflection
as
in
petersburg
instead
of
the
new
life
he
had
hoped
to
lead
he
still
lived
the
old
life
only
in
new
surroundings
of
the
three
precepts
of
freemasonry
pierre
realized
that
he
did
not
fulfill
the
one
which
enjoined
every
mason
to
set
an
example
of
moral
life
and
that
of
the
seven
virtues
he
lacked
two
morality
and
the
love
of
death
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
fulfilled
another
of
the
precepts
that
of
reforming
the
human
race
and
had
other
virtues
love
of
his
neighbor
and
especially
generosity
in
the
spring
of
he
decided
to
return
to
petersburg
on
the
way
he
intended
to
visit
all
his
estates
and
see
for
himself
how
far
his
orders
had
been
carried
out
and
in
what
state
were
the
serfs
whom
god
had
entrusted
to
his
care
and
whom
he
intended
to
benefit
the
chief
steward
who
considered
the
young
count
s
attempts
almost
insane
unprofitable
to
himself
to
the
count
and
to
the
serfs
made
some
concessions
continuing
to
represent
the
liberation
of
the
serfs
as
impracticable
he
arranged
for
the
erection
of
large
buildings
schools
hospitals
and
asylums
on
all
the
estates
before
the
master
arrived
everywhere
preparations
were
made
not
for
ceremonious
welcomes
which
he
knew
pierre
would
not
like
but
for
just
such
gratefully
religious
ones
with
offerings
of
icons
and
the
bread
and
salt
of
hospitality
as
according
to
his
understanding
of
his
master
would
touch
and
delude
him
the
southern
spring
the
comfortable
rapid
traveling
in
a
vienna
carriage
and
the
solitude
of
the
road
all
had
a
gladdening
effect
on
pierre
the
estates
he
had
not
before
visited
were
each
more
picturesque
than
the
other
the
serfs
everywhere
seemed
thriving
and
touchingly
grateful
for
the
benefits
conferred
on
them
everywhere
were
receptions
which
though
they
embarrassed
pierre
awakened
a
joyful
feeling
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
in
one
place
the
peasants
presented
him
with
bread
and
salt
and
an
icon
of
saint
peter
and
saint
paul
asking
permission
as
a
mark
of
their
gratitude
for
the
benefits
he
had
conferred
on
them
to
build
a
new
chantry
to
the
church
at
their
own
expense
in
honor
of
peter
and
paul
his
patron
saints
in
another
place
the
women
with
infants
in
arms
met
him
to
thank
him
for
releasing
them
from
hard
work
on
a
third
estate
the
priest
bearing
a
cross
came
to
meet
him
surrounded
by
children
whom
by
the
count
s
generosity
he
was
instructing
in
reading
writing
and
religion
on
all
his
estates
pierre
saw
with
his
own
eyes
brick
buildings
erected
or
in
course
of
erection
all
on
one
plan
for
hospitals
schools
and
almshouses
which
were
soon
to
be
opened
everywhere
he
saw
the
stewards
accounts
according
to
which
the
serfs
manorial
labor
had
been
diminished
and
heard
the
touching
thanks
of
deputations
of
serfs
in
their
full
skirted
blue
coats
what
pierre
did
not
know
was
that
the
place
where
they
presented
him
with
bread
and
salt
and
wished
to
build
a
chantry
in
honor
of
peter
and
paul
was
a
market
village
where
a
fair
was
held
on
st
peter
s
day
and
that
the
richest
peasants
who
formed
the
deputation
had
begun
the
chantry
long
before
but
that
nine
tenths
of
the
peasants
in
that
villages
were
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
poverty
he
did
not
know
that
since
the
nursing
mothers
were
no
longer
sent
to
work
on
his
land
they
did
still
harder
work
on
their
own
land
he
did
not
know
that
the
priest
who
met
him
with
the
cross
oppressed
the
peasants
by
his
exactions
and
that
the
pupils
parents
wept
at
having
to
let
him
take
their
children
and
secured
their
release
by
heavy
payments
he
did
not
know
that
the
brick
buildings
built
to
plan
were
being
built
by
serfs
whose
manorial
labor
was
thus
increased
though
lessened
on
paper
he
did
not
know
that
where
the
steward
had
shown
him
in
the
accounts
that
the
serfs
payments
had
been
diminished
by
a
third
their
obligatory
manorial
work
had
been
increased
by
a
half
and
so
pierre
was
delighted
with
his
visit
to
his
estates
and
quite
recovered
the
philanthropic
mood
in
which
he
had
left
petersburg
and
wrote
enthusiastic
letters
to
his
brother
instructor
as
he
called
the
grand
master
how
easy
it
is
how
little
effort
it
needs
to
do
so
much
good
thought
pierre
and
how
little
attention
we
pay
to
it
he
was
pleased
at
the
gratitude
he
received
but
felt
abashed
at
receiving
it
this
gratitude
reminded
him
of
how
much
more
he
might
do
for
these
simple
kindly
people
the
chief
steward
a
very
stupid
but
cunning
man
who
saw
perfectly
through
the
naive
and
intelligent
count
and
played
with
him
as
with
a
toy
seeing
the
effect
these
prearranged
receptions
had
on
pierre
pressed
him
still
harder
with
proofs
of
the
impossibility
and
above
all
the
uselessness
of
freeing
the
serfs
who
were
quite
happy
as
it
was
pierre
in
his
secret
soul
agreed
with
the
steward
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
happier
people
and
that
god
only
knew
what
would
happen
to
them
when
they
were
free
but
he
insisted
though
reluctantly
on
what
he
thought
right
the
steward
promised
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
carry
out
the
count
s
wishes
seeing
clearly
that
not
only
would
the
count
never
be
able
to
find
out
whether
all
measures
had
been
taken
for
the
sale
of
the
land
and
forests
and
to
release
them
from
the
land
bank
but
would
probably
never
even
inquire
and
would
never
know
that
the
newly
erected
buildings
were
standing
empty
and
that
the
serfs
continued
to
give
in
money
and
work
all
that
other
people
s
serfs
gave
that
is
to
say
all
that
could
be
got
out
of
them
chapter
xi
returning
from
his
journey
through
south
russia
in
the
happiest
state
of
mind
pierre
carried
out
an
intention
he
had
long
had
of
visiting
his
friend
bolkonski
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
two
years
bogucharovo
lay
in
a
flat
uninteresting
part
of
the
country
among
fields
and
forests
of
fir
and
birch
which
were
partly
cut
down
the
house
lay
behind
a
newly
dug
pond
filled
with
water
to
the
brink
and
with
banks
still
bare
of
grass
it
was
at
the
end
of
a
village
that
stretched
along
the
highroad
in
the
midst
of
a
young
copse
in
which
were
a
few
fir
trees
the
homestead
consisted
of
a
threshing
floor
outhouses
stables
a
bathhouse
a
lodge
and
a
large
brick
house
with
semicircular
facade
still
in
course
of
construction
round
the
house
was
a
garden
newly
laid
out
the
fences
and
gates
were
new
and
solid
two
fire
pumps
and
a
water
cart
painted
green
stood
in
a
shed
the
paths
were
straight
the
bridges
were
strong
and
had
handrails
everything
bore
an
impress
of
tidiness
and
good
management
some
domestic
serfs
pierre
met
in
reply
to
inquiries
as
to
where
the
prince
lived
pointed
out
a
small
newly
built
lodge
close
to
the
pond
anton
a
man
who
had
looked
after
prince
andrew
in
his
boyhood
helped
pierre
out
of
his
carriage
said
that
the
prince
was
at
home
and
showed
him
into
a
clean
little
anteroom
pierre
was
struck
by
the
modesty
of
the
small
though
clean
house
after
the
brilliant
surroundings
in
which
he
had
last
met
his
friend
in
petersburg
he
quickly
entered
the
small
reception
room
with
its
still
unplastered
wooden
walls
redolent
of
pine
and
would
have
gone
farther
but
anton
ran
ahead
on
tiptoe
and
knocked
at
a
door
well
what
is
it
came
a
sharp
unpleasant
voice
a
visitor
answered
anton
ask
him
to
wait
and
the
sound
was
heard
of
a
chair
being
pushed
back
pierre
went
with
rapid
steps
to
the
door
and
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
prince
andrew
who
came
out
frowning
and
looking
old
pierre
embraced
him
and
lifting
his
spectacles
kissed
his
friend
on
the
cheek
and
looked
at
him
closely
well
i
did
not
expect
you
i
am
very
glad
said
prince
andrew
pierre
said
nothing
he
looked
fixedly
at
his
friend
with
surprise
he
was
struck
by
the
change
in
him
his
words
were
kindly
and
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
face
but
his
eyes
were
dull
and
lifeless
and
in
spite
of
his
evident
wish
to
do
so
he
could
not
give
them
a
joyous
and
glad
sparkle
prince
andrew
had
grown
thinner
paler
and
more
manly
looking
but
what
amazed
and
estranged
pierre
till
he
got
used
to
it
were
his
inertia
and
a
wrinkle
on
his
brow
indicating
prolonged
concentration
on
some
one
thought
as
is
usually
the
case
with
people
meeting
after
a
prolonged
separation
it
was
long
before
their
conversation
could
settle
on
anything
they
put
questions
and
gave
brief
replies
about
things
they
knew
ought
to
be
talked
over
at
length
at
last
the
conversation
gradually
settled
on
some
of
the
topics
at
first
lightly
touched
on
their
past
life
plans
for
the
future
pierre
s
journeys
and
occupations
the
war
and
so
on
the
preoccupation
and
despondency
which
pierre
had
noticed
in
his
friend
s
look
was
now
still
more
clearly
expressed
in
the
smile
with
which
he
listened
to
pierre
especially
when
he
spoke
with
joyful
animation
of
the
past
or
the
future
it
was
as
if
prince
andrew
would
have
liked
to
sympathize
with
what
pierre
was
saying
but
could
not
the
latter
began
to
feel
that
it
was
in
bad
taste
to
speak
of
his
enthusiasms
dreams
and
hopes
of
happiness
or
goodness
in
prince
andrew
s
presence
he
was
ashamed
to
express
his
new
masonic
views
which
had
been
particularly
revived
and
strengthened
by
his
late
tour
he
checked
himself
fearing
to
seem
naive
yet
he
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
show
his
friend
as
soon
as
possible
that
he
was
now
a
quite
different
and
better
pierre
than
he
had
been
in
petersburg
i
can
t
tell
you
how
much
i
have
lived
through
since
then
i
hardly
know
myself
again
yes
we
have
altered
much
very
much
since
then
said
prince
andrew
well
and
you
what
are
your
plans
plans
repeated
prince
andrew
ironically
my
plans
he
said
as
if
astonished
at
the
word
well
you
see
i
m
building
i
mean
to
settle
here
altogether
next
year
pierre
looked
silently
and
searchingly
into
prince
andrew
s
face
which
had
grown
much
older
no
i
meant
to
ask
pierre
began
but
prince
andrew
interrupted
him
but
why
talk
of
me
talk
to
me
yes
tell
me
about
your
travels
and
all
you
have
been
doing
on
your
estates
pierre
began
describing
what
he
had
done
on
his
estates
trying
as
far
as
possible
to
conceal
his
own
part
in
the
improvements
that
had
been
made
prince
andrew
several
times
prompted
pierre
s
story
of
what
he
had
been
doing
as
though
it
were
all
an
old
time
story
and
he
listened
not
only
without
interest
but
even
as
if
ashamed
of
what
pierre
was
telling
him
pierre
felt
uncomfortable
and
even
depressed
in
his
friend
s
company
and
at
last
became
silent
i
ll
tell
you
what
my
dear
fellow
said
prince
andrew
who
evidently
also
felt
depressed
and
constrained
with
his
visitor
i
am
only
bivouacking
here
and
have
just
come
to
look
round
i
am
going
back
to
my
sister
today
i
will
introduce
you
to
her
but
of
course
you
know
her
already
he
said
evidently
trying
to
entertain
a
visitor
with
whom
he
now
found
nothing
in
common
we
will
go
after
dinner
and
would
you
now
like
to
look
round
my
place
they
went
out
and
walked
about
till
dinnertime
talking
of
the
political
news
and
common
acquaintances
like
people
who
do
not
know
each
other
intimately
prince
andrew
spoke
with
some
animation
and
interest
only
of
the
new
homestead
he
was
constructing
and
its
buildings
but
even
here
while
on
the
scaffolding
in
the
midst
of
a
talk
explaining
the
future
arrangements
of
the
house
he
interrupted
himself
however
this
is
not
at
all
interesting
let
us
have
dinner
and
then
we
ll
set
off
at
dinner
conversation
turned
on
pierre
s
marriage
i
was
very
much
surprised
when
i
heard
of
it
said
prince
andrew
pierre
blushed
as
he
always
did
when
it
was
mentioned
and
said
hurriedly
i
will
tell
you
some
time
how
it
all
happened
but
you
know
it
is
all
over
and
forever
forever
said
prince
andrew
nothing
s
forever
but
you
know
how
it
all
ended
don
t
you
you
heard
of
the
duel
and
so
you
had
to
go
through
that
too
one
thing
i
thank
god
for
is
that
i
did
not
kill
that
man
said
pierre
why
so
asked
prince
andrew
to
kill
a
vicious
dog
is
a
very
good
thing
really
no
to
kill
a
man
is
bad
wrong
why
is
it
wrong
urged
prince
andrew
it
is
not
given
to
man
to
know
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
men
always
did
and
always
will
err
and
in
nothing
more
than
in
what
they
consider
right
and
wrong
what
does
harm
to
another
is
wrong
said
pierre
feeling
with
pleasure
that
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
prince
andrew
was
roused
had
begun
to
talk
and
wanted
to
express
what
had
brought
him
to
his
present
state
and
who
has
told
you
what
is
bad
for
another
man
he
asked
bad
bad
exclaimed
pierre
we
all
know
what
is
bad
for
ourselves
yes
we
know
that
but
the
harm
i
am
conscious
of
in
myself
is
something
i
cannot
inflict
on
others
said
prince
andrew
growing
more
and
more
animated
and
evidently
wishing
to
express
his
new
outlook
to
pierre
he
spoke
in
french
i
only
know
two
very
real
evils
in
life
remorse
and
illness
the
only
good
is
the
absence
of
those
evils
to
live
for
myself
avoiding
those
two
evils
is
my
whole
philosophy
now
and
love
of
one
s
neighbor
and
self
sacrifice
began
pierre
no
i
can
t
agree
with
you
to
live
only
so
as
not
to
do
evil
and
not
to
have
to
repent
is
not
enough
i
lived
like
that
i
lived
for
myself
and
ruined
my
life
and
only
now
when
i
am
living
or
at
least
trying
pierre
s
modesty
made
him
correct
himself
to
live
for
others
only
now
have
i
understood
all
the
happiness
of
life
no
i
shall
not
agree
with
you
and
you
do
not
really
believe
what
you
are
saying
prince
andrew
looked
silently
at
pierre
with
an
ironic
smile
when
you
see
my
sister
princess
mary
you
ll
get
on
with
her
he
said
perhaps
you
are
right
for
yourself
he
added
after
a
short
pause
but
everyone
lives
in
his
own
way
you
lived
for
yourself
and
say
you
nearly
ruined
your
life
and
only
found
happiness
when
you
began
living
for
others
i
experienced
just
the
reverse
i
lived
for
glory
and
after
all
what
is
glory
the
same
love
of
others
a
desire
to
do
something
for
them
a
desire
for
their
approval
so
i
lived
for
others
and
not
almost
but
quite
ruined
my
life
and
i
have
become
calmer
since
i
began
to
live
only
for
myself
but
what
do
you
mean
by
living
only
for
yourself
asked
pierre
growing
excited
what
about
your
son
your
sister
and
your
father
but
that
s
just
the
same
as
myself
they
are
not
others
explained
prince
andrew
the
others
one
s
neighbors
le
prochain
as
you
and
princess
mary
call
it
are
the
chief
source
of
all
error
and
evil
le
prochain
your
kiev
peasants
to
whom
you
want
to
do
good
and
he
looked
at
pierre
with
a
mocking
challenging
expression
he
evidently
wished
to
draw
him
on
you
are
joking
replied
pierre
growing
more
and
more
excited
what
error
or
evil
can
there
be
in
my
wishing
to
do
good
and
even
doing
a
little
though
i
did
very
little
and
did
it
very
badly
what
evil
can
there
be
in
it
if
unfortunate
people
our
serfs
people
like
ourselves
were
growing
up
and
dying
with
no
idea
of
god
and
truth
beyond
ceremonies
and
meaningless
prayers
and
are
now
instructed
in
a
comforting
belief
in
future
life
retribution
recompense
and
consolation
what
evil
and
error
are
there
in
it
if
people
were
dying
of
disease
without
help
while
material
assistance
could
so
easily
be
rendered
and
i
supplied
them
with
a
doctor
a
hospital
and
an
asylum
for
the
aged
and
is
it
not
a
palpable
unquestionable
good
if
a
peasant
or
a
woman
with
a
baby
has
no
rest
day
or
night
and
i
give
them
rest
and
leisure
said
pierre
hurrying
and
lisping
and
i
have
done
that
though
badly
and
to
a
small
extent
but
i
have
done
something
toward
it
and
you
cannot
persuade
me
that
it
was
not
a
good
action
and
more
than
that
you
can
t
make
me
believe
that
you
do
not
think
so
yourself
and
the
main
thing
is
he
continued
that
i
know
and
know
for
certain
that
the
enjoyment
of
doing
this
good
is
the
only
sure
happiness
in
life
yes
if
you
put
it
like
that
it
s
quite
a
different
matter
said
prince
andrew
i
build
a
house
and
lay
out
a
garden
and
you
build
hospitals
the
one
and
the
other
may
serve
as
a
pastime
but
what
s
right
and
what
s
good
must
be
judged
by
one
who
knows
all
but
not
by
us
well
you
want
an
argument
he
added
come
on
then
they
rose
from
the
table
and
sat
down
in
the
entrance
porch
which
served
as
a
veranda
come
let
s
argue
then
said
prince
andrew
you
talk
of
schools
he
went
on
crooking
a
finger
education
and
so
forth
that
is
you
want
to
raise
him
pointing
to
a
peasant
who
passed
by
them
taking
off
his
cap
from
his
animal
condition
and
awaken
in
him
spiritual
needs
while
it
seems
to
me
that
animal
happiness
is
the
only
happiness
possible
and
that
is
just
what
you
want
to
deprive
him
of
i
envy
him
but
you
want
to
make
him
what
i
am
without
giving
him
my
means
then
you
say
lighten
his
toil
but
as
i
see
it
physical
labor
is
as
essential
to
him
as
much
a
condition
of
his
existence
as
mental
activity
is
to
you
or
me
you
can
t
help
thinking
i
go
to
bed
after
two
in
the
morning
thoughts
come
and
i
can
t
sleep
but
toss
about
till
dawn
because
i
think
and
can
t
help
thinking
just
as
he
can
t
help
plowing
and
mowing
if
he
didn
t
he
would
go
to
the
drink
shop
or
fall
ill
just
as
i
could
not
stand
his
terrible
physical
labor
but
should
die
of
it
in
a
week
so
he
could
not
stand
my
physical
idleness
but
would
grow
fat
and
die
the
third
thing
what
else
was
it
you
talked
about
and
prince
andrew
crooked
a
third
finger
ah
yes
hospitals
medicine
he
has
a
fit
he
is
dying
and
you
come
and
bleed
him
and
patch
him
up
he
will
drag
about
as
a
cripple
a
burden
to
everybody
for
another
ten
years
it
would
be
far
easier
and
simpler
for
him
to
die
others
are
being
born
and
there
are
plenty
of
them
as
it
is
it
would
be
different
if
you
grudged
losing
a
laborer
that
s
how
i
regard
him
but
you
want
to
cure
him
from
love
of
him
and
he
does
not
want
that
and
besides
what
a
notion
that
medicine
ever
cured
anyone
killed
them
yes
said
he
frowning
angrily
and
turning
away
from
pierre
prince
andrew
expressed
his
ideas
so
clearly
and
distinctly
that
it
was
evident
he
had
reflected
on
this
subject
more
than
once
and
he
spoke
readily
and
rapidly
like
a
man
who
has
not
talked
for
a
long
time
his
glance
became
more
animated
as
his
conclusions
became
more
hopeless
oh
that
is
dreadful
dreadful
said
pierre
i
don
t
understand
how
one
can
live
with
such
ideas
i
had
such
moments
myself
not
long
ago
in
moscow
and
when
traveling
but
at
such
times
i
collapsed
so
that
i
don
t
live
at
all
everything
seems
hateful
to
me
myself
most
of
all
then
i
don
t
eat
don
t
wash
and
how
is
it
with
you
why
not
wash
that
is
not
cleanly
said
prince
andrew
on
the
contrary
one
must
try
to
make
one
s
life
as
pleasant
as
possible
i
m
alive
that
is
not
my
fault
so
i
must
live
out
my
life
as
best
i
can
without
hurting
others
but
with
such
ideas
what
motive
have
you
for
living
one
would
sit
without
moving
undertaking
nothing
life
as
it
is
leaves
one
no
peace
i
should
be
thankful
to
do
nothing
but
here
on
the
one
hand
the
local
nobility
have
done
me
the
honor
to
choose
me
to
be
their
marshal
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
out
of
it
they
could
not
understand
that
i
have
not
the
necessary
qualifications
for
it
the
kind
of
good
natured
fussy
shallowness
necessary
for
the
position
then
there
s
this
house
which
must
be
built
in
order
to
have
a
nook
of
one
s
own
in
which
to
be
quiet
and
now
there
s
this
recruiting
why
aren
t
you
serving
in
the
army
after
austerlitz
said
prince
andrew
gloomily
no
thank
you
very
much
i
have
promised
myself
not
to
serve
again
in
the
active
russian
army
and
i
won
t
not
even
if
bonaparte
were
here
at
smolensk
threatening
bald
hills
even
then
i
wouldn
t
serve
in
the
russian
army
well
as
i
was
saying
he
continued
recovering
his
composure
now
there
s
this
recruiting
my
father
is
chief
in
command
of
the
third
district
and
my
only
way
of
avoiding
active
service
is
to
serve
under
him
then
you
are
serving
i
am
he
paused
a
little
while
and
why
do
you
serve
why
for
this
reason
my
father
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
his
time
but
he
is
growing
old
and
though
not
exactly
cruel
he
has
too
energetic
a
character
he
is
so
accustomed
to
unlimited
power
that
he
is
terrible
and
now
he
has
this
authority
of
a
commander
in
chief
of
the
recruiting
granted
by
the
emperor
if
i
had
been
two
hours
late
a
fortnight
ago
he
would
have
had
a
paymaster
s
clerk
at
yukhnovna
hanged
said
prince
andrew
with
a
smile
so
i
am
serving
because
i
alone
have
any
influence
with
my
father
and
now
and
then
can
save
him
from
actions
which
would
torment
him
afterwards
well
there
you
see
yes
but
it
is
not
as
you
imagine
prince
andrew
continued
i
did
not
and
do
not
in
the
least
care
about
that
scoundrel
of
a
clerk
who
had
stolen
some
boots
from
the
recruits
i
should
even
have
been
very
glad
to
see
him
hanged
but
i
was
sorry
for
my
father
that
again
is
for
myself
prince
andrew
grew
more
and
more
animated
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
while
he
tried
to
prove
to
pierre
that
in
his
actions
there
was
no
desire
to
do
good
to
his
neighbor
there
now
you
wish
to
liberate
your
serfs
he
continued
that
is
a
very
good
thing
but
not
for
you
i
don
t
suppose
you
ever
had
anyone
flogged
or
sent
to
siberia
and
still
less
for
your
serfs
if
they
are
beaten
flogged
or
sent
to
siberia
i
don
t
suppose
they
are
any
the
worse
off
in
siberia
they
lead
the
same
animal
life
and
the
stripes
on
their
bodies
heal
and
they
are
happy
as
before
but
it
is
a
good
thing
for
proprietors
who
perish
morally
bring
remorse
upon
themselves
stifle
this
remorse
and
grow
callous
as
a
result
of
being
able
to
inflict
punishments
justly
and
unjustly
it
is
those
people
i
pity
and
for
their
sake
i
should
like
to
liberate
the
serfs
you
may
not
have
seen
but
i
have
seen
how
good
men
brought
up
in
those
traditions
of
unlimited
power
in
time
when
they
grow
more
irritable
become
cruel
and
harsh
are
conscious
of
it
but
cannot
restrain
themselves
and
grow
more
and
more
miserable
prince
andrew
spoke
so
earnestly
that
pierre
could
not
help
thinking
that
these
thoughts
had
been
suggested
to
prince
andrew
by
his
father
s
case
he
did
not
reply
so
that
s
what
i
m
sorry
for
human
dignity
peace
of
mind
purity
and
not
the
serfs
backs
and
foreheads
which
beat
and
shave
as
you
may
always
remain
the
same
backs
and
foreheads
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
shall
never
agree
with
you
said
pierre
chapter
xii
in
the
evening
andrew
and
pierre
got
into
the
open
carriage
and
drove
to
bald
hills
prince
andrew
glancing
at
pierre
broke
the
silence
now
and
then
with
remarks
which
showed
that
he
was
in
a
good
temper
pointing
to
the
fields
he
spoke
of
the
improvements
he
was
making
in
his
husbandry
pierre
remained
gloomily
silent
answering
in
monosyllables
and
apparently
immersed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
was
thinking
that
prince
andrew
was
unhappy
had
gone
astray
did
not
see
the
true
light
and
that
he
pierre
ought
to
aid
enlighten
and
raise
him
but
as
soon
as
he
thought
of
what
he
should
say
he
felt
that
prince
andrew
with
one
word
one
argument
