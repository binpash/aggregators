i
well
prince
so
genoa
and
lucca
are
now
just
family
estates
of
the
buonapartes
but
i
warn
you
if
you
don
t
tell
me
that
this
means
war
if
you
still
try
to
defend
the
infamies
and
horrors
perpetrated
by
that
antichrist
i
really
believe
he
is
antichrist
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
and
you
are
no
longer
my
friend
no
longer
my
faithful
slave
as
you
call
yourself
but
how
do
you
do
i
see
i
have
frightened
you
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
the
news
it
was
in
july
and
the
speaker
was
the
well
known
anna
pavlovna
scherer
maid
of
honor
and
favorite
of
the
empress
marya
fedorovna
with
these
words
she
greeted
prince
vasili
kuragin
a
man
of
high
rank
and
importance
who
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
her
reception
anna
pavlovna
had
had
a
cough
for
some
days
she
was
as
she
said
suffering
from
la
grippe
grippe
being
then
a
new
word
in
st
petersburg
used
only
by
the
elite
all
her
invitations
without
exception
written
in
french
and
delivered
by
a
scarlet
liveried
footman
that
morning
ran
as
follows
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
count
or
prince
and
if
the
prospect
of
spending
an
evening
with
a
poor
invalid
is
not
too
terrible
i
shall
be
very
charmed
to
see
you
tonight
between
and
annette
scherer
heavens
what
a
virulent
attack
replied
the
prince
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
by
this
reception
he
had
just
entered
wearing
an
embroidered
court
uniform
knee
breeches
and
shoes
and
had
stars
on
his
breast
and
a
serene
expression
on
his
flat
face
he
spoke
in
that
refined
french
in
which
our
grandfathers
not
only
spoke
but
thought
and
with
the
gentle
patronizing
intonation
natural
to
a
man
of
importance
who
had
grown
old
in
society
and
at
court
he
went
up
to
anna
pavlovna
kissed
her
hand
presenting
to
her
his
bald
scented
and
shining
head
and
complacently
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
first
of
all
dear
friend
tell
me
how
you
are
set
your
friend
s
mind
at
rest
said
he
without
altering
his
tone
beneath
the
politeness
and
affected
sympathy
of
which
indifference
and
even
irony
could
be
discerned
can
one
be
well
while
suffering
morally
can
one
be
calm
in
times
like
these
if
one
has
any
feeling
said
anna
pavlovna
you
are
staying
the
whole
evening
i
hope
and
the
fete
at
the
english
ambassador
s
today
is
wednesday
i
must
put
in
an
appearance
there
said
the
prince
my
daughter
is
coming
for
me
to
take
me
there
i
thought
today
s
fete
had
been
canceled
i
confess
all
these
festivities
and
fireworks
are
becoming
wearisome
if
they
had
known
that
you
wished
it
the
entertainment
would
have
been
put
off
said
the
prince
who
like
a
wound
up
clock
by
force
of
habit
said
things
he
did
not
even
wish
to
be
believed
don
t
tease
well
and
what
has
been
decided
about
novosiltsev
s
dispatch
you
know
everything
what
can
one
say
about
it
replied
the
prince
in
a
cold
listless
tone
what
has
been
decided
they
have
decided
that
buonaparte
has
burnt
his
boats
and
i
believe
that
we
are
ready
to
burn
ours
prince
vasili
always
spoke
languidly
like
an
actor
repeating
a
stale
part
anna
pavlovna
scherer
on
the
contrary
despite
her
forty
years
overflowed
with
animation
and
impulsiveness
to
be
an
enthusiast
had
become
her
social
vocation
and
sometimes
even
when
she
did
not
feel
like
it
she
became
enthusiastic
in
order
not
to
disappoint
the
expectations
of
those
who
knew
her
the
subdued
smile
which
though
it
did
not
suit
her
faded
features
always
played
round
her
lips
expressed
as
in
a
spoiled
child
a
continual
consciousness
of
her
charming
defect
which
she
neither
wished
nor
could
nor
considered
it
necessary
to
correct
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
on
political
matters
anna
pavlovna
burst
out
oh
don
t
speak
to
me
of
austria
perhaps
i
don
t
understand
things
but
austria
never
has
wished
and
does
not
wish
for
war
she
is
betraying
us
russia
alone
must
save
europe
our
gracious
sovereign
recognizes
his
high
vocation
and
will
be
true
to
it
that
is
the
one
thing
i
have
faith
in
our
good
and
wonderful
sovereign
has
to
perform
the
noblest
role
on
earth
and
he
is
so
virtuous
and
noble
that
god
will
not
forsake
him
he
will
fulfill
his
vocation
and
crush
the
hydra
of
revolution
which
has
become
more
terrible
than
ever
in
the
person
of
this
murderer
and
villain
we
alone
must
avenge
the
blood
of
the
just
one
whom
i
ask
you
can
we
rely
on
england
with
her
commercial
spirit
will
not
and
cannot
understand
the
emperor
alexander
s
loftiness
of
soul
she
has
refused
to
evacuate
malta
she
wanted
to
find
and
still
seeks
some
secret
motive
in
our
actions
what
answer
did
novosiltsev
get
none
the
english
have
not
understood
and
cannot
understand
the
self
abnegation
of
our
emperor
who
wants
nothing
for
himself
but
only
desires
the
good
of
mankind
and
what
have
they
promised
nothing
and
what
little
they
have
promised
they
will
not
perform
prussia
has
always
declared
that
buonaparte
is
invincible
and
that
all
europe
is
powerless
before
him
and
i
don
t
believe
a
word
that
hardenburg
says
or
haugwitz
either
this
famous
prussian
neutrality
is
just
a
trap
i
have
faith
only
in
god
and
the
lofty
destiny
of
our
adored
monarch
he
will
save
europe
she
suddenly
paused
smiling
at
her
own
impetuosity
i
think
said
the
prince
with
a
smile
that
if
you
had
been
sent
instead
of
our
dear
wintzingerode
you
would
have
captured
the
king
of
prussia
s
consent
by
assault
you
are
so
eloquent
will
you
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
in
a
moment
a
propos
she
added
becoming
calm
again
i
am
expecting
two
very
interesting
men
tonight
le
vicomte
de
mortemart
who
is
connected
with
the
montmorencys
through
the
rohans
one
of
the
best
french
families
he
is
one
of
the
genuine
emigres
the
good
ones
and
also
the
abbe
morio
do
you
know
that
profound
thinker
he
has
been
received
by
the
emperor
had
you
heard
i
shall
be
delighted
to
meet
them
said
the
prince
but
tell
me
he
added
with
studied
carelessness
as
if
it
had
only
just
occurred
to
him
though
the
question
he
was
about
to
ask
was
the
chief
motive
of
his
visit
is
it
true
that
the
dowager
empress
wants
baron
funke
to
be
appointed
first
secretary
at
vienna
the
baron
by
all
accounts
is
a
poor
creature
prince
vasili
wished
to
obtain
this
post
for
his
son
but
others
were
trying
through
the
dowager
empress
marya
fedorovna
to
secure
it
for
the
baron
anna
pavlovna
almost
closed
her
eyes
to
indicate
that
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
had
a
right
to
criticize
what
the
empress
desired
or
was
pleased
with
baron
funke
has
been
recommended
to
the
dowager
empress
by
her
sister
was
all
she
said
in
a
dry
and
mournful
tone
as
she
named
the
empress
anna
pavlovna
s
face
suddenly
assumed
an
expression
of
profound
and
sincere
devotion
and
respect
mingled
with
sadness
and
this
occurred
every
time
she
mentioned
her
illustrious
patroness
she
added
that
her
majesty
had
deigned
to
show
baron
funke
beaucoup
d
estime
and
again
her
face
clouded
over
with
sadness
the
prince
was
silent
and
looked
indifferent
but
with
the
womanly
and
courtierlike
quickness
and
tact
habitual
to
her
anna
pavlovna
wished
both
to
rebuke
him
for
daring
to
speak
as
he
had
done
of
a
man
recommended
to
the
empress
and
at
the
same
time
to
console
him
so
she
said
now
about
your
family
do
you
know
that
since
your
daughter
came
out
everyone
has
been
enraptured
by
her
they
say
she
is
amazingly
beautiful
the
prince
bowed
to
signify
his
respect
and
gratitude
i
often
think
she
continued
after
a
short
pause
drawing
nearer
to
the
prince
and
smiling
amiably
at
him
as
if
to
show
that
political
and
social
topics
were
ended
and
the
time
had
come
for
intimate
conversation
i
often
think
how
unfairly
sometimes
the
joys
of
life
are
distributed
why
has
fate
given
you
two
such
splendid
children
i
don
t
speak
of
anatole
your
youngest
i
don
t
like
him
she
added
in
a
tone
admitting
of
no
rejoinder
and
raising
her
eyebrows
two
such
charming
children
and
really
you
appreciate
them
less
than
anyone
and
so
you
don
t
deserve
to
have
them
and
she
smiled
her
ecstatic
smile
i
can
t
help
it
said
the
prince
lavater
would
have
said
i
lack
the
bump
of
paternity
don
t
joke
i
mean
to
have
a
serious
talk
with
you
do
you
know
i
am
dissatisfied
with
your
younger
son
between
ourselves
and
her
face
assumed
its
melancholy
expression
he
was
mentioned
at
her
majesty
s
and
you
were
pitied
the
prince
answered
nothing
but
she
looked
at
him
significantly
awaiting
a
reply
he
frowned
what
would
you
have
me
do
he
said
at
last
you
know
i
did
all
a
father
could
for
their
education
and
they
have
both
turned
out
fools
hippolyte
is
at
least
a
quiet
fool
but
anatole
is
an
active
one
that
is
the
only
difference
between
them
he
said
this
smiling
in
a
way
more
natural
and
animated
than
usual
so
that
the
wrinkles
round
his
mouth
very
clearly
revealed
something
unexpectedly
coarse
and
unpleasant
and
why
are
children
born
to
such
men
as
you
if
you
were
not
a
father
there
would
be
nothing
i
could
reproach
you
with
said
anna
pavlovna
looking
up
pensively
i
am
your
faithful
slave
and
to
you
alone
i
can
confess
that
my
children
are
the
bane
of
my
life
it
is
the
cross
i
have
to
bear
that
is
how
i
explain
it
to
myself
it
can
t
be
helped
he
said
no
more
but
expressed
his
resignation
to
cruel
fate
by
a
gesture
anna
pavlovna
meditated
have
you
never
thought
of
marrying
your
prodigal
son
anatole
she
asked
they
say
old
maids
have
a
mania
for
matchmaking
and
though
i
don
t
feel
that
weakness
in
myself
as
yet
i
know
a
little
person
who
is
very
unhappy
with
her
father
she
is
a
relation
of
yours
princess
mary
bolkonskaya
prince
vasili
did
not
reply
though
with
the
quickness
of
memory
and
perception
befitting
a
man
of
the
world
he
indicated
by
a
movement
of
the
head
that
he
was
considering
this
information
do
you
know
he
said
at
last
evidently
unable
to
check
the
sad
current
of
his
thoughts
that
anatole
is
costing
me
forty
thousand
rubles
a
year
and
he
went
on
after
a
pause

chapter
ii
anna
pavlovna
s
drawing
room
was
gradually
filling
the
highest
petersburg
society
was
assembled
there
people
differing
widely
in
age
and
character
but
alike
in
the
social
circle
to
which
they
belonged
prince
vasili
s
daughter
the
beautiful
helene
came
to
take
her
father
to

and
her
badge
as

the
youthful
little
princess
bolkonskaya
known
as
la

la
plus
seduisante
de
petersbourg
was
also
there
she
had
been
married
during
the
previous
winter
and
being
pregnant
did
not
go
to
any
large
gatherings
but
only
to
small
receptions
prince
vasili
s
son
hippolyte
had
come
with
mortemart
whom
he
introduced
the
abbe
morio
and
many
others
had
also
come
the
most
fascinating
woman
in
petersburg
to
each
new
arrival
anna
pavlovna
said
you
have
not
yet
seen
my
aunt
or
you
do
not
know
my
aunt
and
very
gravely
conducted
him
or
her
to
a
little
old
lady
wearing
large
bows
of
ribbon
in
her
cap
who
had
come
sailing
in
from
another
room
as
soon
as
the
guests
began
to
arrive
and
slowly
turning
her
eyes
from
the
visitor
to
her
aunt
anna
pavlovna
mentioned
each
one
s
name
and
then
left
them
each
visitor
performed
the
ceremony
of
greeting
this
old
aunt
whom
not
one
of
them
knew
not
one
of
them
wanted
to
know
and
not
one
of
them
cared
about
anna
pavlovna
observed
these
greetings
with
mournful
and
solemn
interest
and
silent
approval
the
aunt
spoke
to
each
of
them
in
the
same
words
about
their
health
and
her
own
and
the
health
of
her
majesty
who
thank
god
was
better
today
and
each
visitor
though
politeness
prevented
his
showing
impatience
left
the
old
woman
with
a
sense
of
relief
at
having
performed
a
vexatious
duty
and
did
not
return
to
her
the
whole
evening
the
young
princess
bolkonskaya
had
brought
some
work
in
a
gold
embroidered
velvet
bag
her
pretty
little
upper
lip
on
which
a
delicate
dark
down
was
just
perceptible
was
too
short
for
her
teeth
but
it
lifted
all
the
more
sweetly
and
was
especially
charming
when
she
occasionally
drew
it
down
to
meet
the
lower
lip
as
is
always
the
case
with
a
thoroughly
attractive
woman
her
defect
the
shortness
of
her
upper
lip
and
her
half
open
mouth
seemed
to
be
her
own
special
and
peculiar
form
of
beauty
everyone
brightened
at
the
sight
of
this
pretty
young
woman
so
soon
to
become
a
mother
so
full
of
life
and
health
and
carrying
her
burden
so
lightly
old
men
and
dull
dispirited
young
ones
who
looked
at
her
after
being
in
her
company
and
talking
to
her
a
little
while
felt
as
if
they
too
were
becoming
like
her
full
of
life
and
health
all
who
talked
to
her
and
at
each
word
saw
her
bright
smile
and
the
constant
gleam
of
her
white
teeth
thought
that
they
were
in
a
specially
amiable
mood
that
day
the
little
princess
went
round
the
table
with
quick
short
swaying
steps
her
workbag
on
her
arm
and
gaily
spreading
out
her
dress
sat
down
on
a
sofa
near
the
silver
samovar
as
if
all
she
was
doing
was
a
pleasure
to
herself
and
to
all
around
her
i
have
brought
my
work
said
she
in
french
displaying
her
bag
and
addressing
all
present
mind
annette
i
hope
you
have
not
played
a
wicked
trick
on
me
she
added
turning
to
her
hostess
you
wrote
that
it
was
to
be
quite
a
small
reception
and
just
see
how
badly
i
am
dressed
and
she
spread
out
her
arms
to
show
her
short
waisted
lace
trimmed
dainty
gray
dress
girdled
with
a
broad
ribbon
just
below
the
breast
soyez
tranquille
lise
you
will
always
be
prettier
than
anyone
else
replied
anna
pavlovna
you
know
said
the
princess
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
and
still
in
french
turning
to
a
general
my
husband
is
deserting
me
he
is
going
to
get
himself
killed
tell
me
what
this
wretched
war
is
for
she
added
addressing
prince
vasili
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
turned
to
speak
to
his
daughter
the
beautiful
helene
what
a
delightful
woman
this
little
princess
is
said
prince
vasili
to
anna
pavlovna
one
of
the
next
arrivals
was
a
stout
heavily
built
young
man
with
close
cropped
hair
spectacles
the
light
colored
breeches
fashionable
at
that
time
a
very
high
ruffle
and
a
brown
dress
coat
this
stout
young
man
was
an
illegitimate
son
of
count
bezukhov
a
well
known
grandee
of
catherine
s
time
who
now
lay
dying
in
moscow
the
young
man
had
not
yet
entered
either
the
military
or
civil
service
as
he
had
only
just
returned
from
abroad
where
he
had
been
educated
and
this
was
his
first
appearance
in
society
anna
pavlovna
greeted
him
with
the
nod
she
accorded
to
the
lowest
hierarchy
in
her
drawing
room
but
in
spite
of
this
lowest
grade
greeting
a
look
of
anxiety
and
fear
as
at
the
sight
of
something
too
large
and
unsuited
to
the
place
came
over
her
face
when
she
saw
pierre
enter
though
he
was
certainly
rather
bigger
than
the
other
men
in
the
room
her
anxiety
could
only
have
reference
to
the
clever
though
shy
but
observant
and
natural
expression
which
distinguished
him
from
everyone
else
in
that
drawing
room
it
is
very
good
of
you
monsieur
pierre
to
come
and
visit
a
poor
invalid
said
anna
pavlovna
exchanging
an
alarmed
glance
with
her
aunt
as
she
conducted
him
to
her
pierre
murmured
something
unintelligible
and
continued
to
look
round
as
if
in
search
of
something
on
his
way
to
the
aunt
he
bowed
to
the
little
princess
with
a
pleased
smile
as
to
an
intimate
acquaintance
anna
pavlovna
s
alarm
was
justified
for
pierre
turned
away
from
the
aunt
without
waiting
to
hear
her
speech
about
her
majesty
s
health
anna
pavlovna
in
dismay
detained
him
with
the
words
do
you
know
the
abbe
morio
he
is
a
most
interesting
man
yes
i
have
heard
of
his
scheme
for
perpetual
peace
and
it
is
very
interesting
but
hardly
feasible
you
think
so
rejoined
anna
pavlovna
in
order
to
say
something
and
get
away
to
attend
to
her
duties
as
hostess
but
pierre
now
committed
a
reverse
act
of
impoliteness
first
he
had
left
a
lady
before
she
had
finished
speaking
to
him
and
now
he
continued
to
speak
to
another
who
wished
to
get
away
with
his
head
bent
and
his
big
feet
spread
apart
he
began
explaining
his
reasons
for
thinking
the
abbe
s
plan
chimerical
we
will
talk
of
it
later
said
anna
pavlovna
with
a
smile
and
having
got
rid
of
this
young
man
who
did
not
know
how
to
behave
she
resumed
her
duties
as
hostess
and
continued
to
listen
and
watch
ready
to
help
at
any
point
where
the
conversation
might
happen
to
flag
as
the
foreman
of
a
spinning
mill
when
he
has
set
the
hands
to
work
goes
round
and
notices
here
a
spindle
that
has
stopped
or
there
one
that
creaks
or
makes
more
noise
than
it
should
and
hastens
to
check
the
machine
or
set
it
in
proper
motion
so
anna
pavlovna
moved
about
her
drawing
room
approaching
now
a
silent
now
a
too
noisy
group
and
by
a
word
or
slight
rearrangement
kept
the
conversational
machine
in
steady
proper
and
regular
motion
but
amid
these
cares
her
anxiety
about
pierre
was
evident
she
kept
an
anxious
watch
on
him
when
he
approached
the
group
round
mortemart
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
there
and
again
when
he
passed
to
another
group
whose
center
was
the
abbe
pierre
had
been
educated
abroad
and
this
reception
at
anna
pavlovna
s
was
the
first
he
had
attended
in
russia
he
knew
that
all
the
intellectual
lights
of
petersburg
were
gathered
there
and
like
a
child
in
a
toyshop
did
not
know
which
way
to
look
afraid
of
missing
any
clever
conversation
that
was
to
be
heard
seeing
the
self
confident
and
refined
expression
on
the
faces
of
those
present
he
was
always
expecting
to
hear
something
very
profound
at
last
he
came
up
to
morio
here
the
conversation
seemed
interesting
and
he
stood
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
express
his
own
views
as
young
people
are
fond
of
doing
chapter
iii
anna
pavlovna
s
reception
was
in
full
swing
the
spindles
hummed
steadily
and
ceaselessly
on
all
sides
with
the
exception
of
the
aunt
beside
whom
sat
only
one
elderly
lady
who
with
her
thin
careworn
face
was
rather
out
of
place
in
this
brilliant
society
the
whole
company
had
settled
into
three
groups
one
chiefly
masculine
had
formed
round
the
abbe
another
of
young
people
was
grouped
round
the
beautiful
princess
helene
prince
vasili
s
daughter
and
the
little
princess
bolkonskaya
very
pretty
and
rosy
though
rather
too
plump
for
her
age
the
third
group
was
gathered
round
mortemart
and
anna
pavlovna
the
vicomte
was
a
nice
looking
young
man
with
soft
features
and
polished
manners
who
evidently
considered
himself
a
celebrity
but
out
of
politeness
modestly
placed
himself
at
the
disposal
of
the
circle
in
which
he
found
himself
anna
pavlovna
was
obviously
serving
him
up
as
a
treat
to
her
guests
as
a
clever
maitre
d
hotel
serves
up
as
a
specially
choice
delicacy
a
piece
of
meat
that
no
one
who
had
seen
it
in
the
kitchen
would
have
cared
to
eat
so
anna
pavlovna
served
up
to
her
guests
first
the
vicomte
and
then
the
abbe
as
peculiarly
choice
morsels
the
group
about
mortemart
immediately
began
discussing
the
murder
of
the
duc
d
enghien
the
vicomte
said
that
the
duc
d
enghien
had
perished
by
his
own
magnanimity
and
that
there
were
particular
reasons
for
buonaparte
s
hatred
of
him
ah
yes
do
tell
us
all
about
it
vicomte
said
anna
pavlovna
with
a
pleasant
feeling
that
there
was
something
a
la
louis
xv
in
the
sound
of
that
sentence
contez
nous
cela
vicomte
the
vicomte
bowed
and
smiled
courteously
in
token
of
his
willingness
to
comply
anna
pavlovna
arranged
a
group
round
him
inviting
everyone
to
listen
to
his
tale
the
vicomte
knew
the
duc
personally
whispered
anna
pavlovna
to
one
of
the
guests
the
vicomte
is
a
wonderful
raconteur
said
she
to
another
how
evidently
he
belongs
to
the
best
society
said
she
to
a
third
and
the
vicomte
was
served
up
to
the
company
in
the
choicest
and
most
advantageous
style
like
a
well
garnished
joint
of
roast
beef
on
a
hot
dish
the
vicomte
wished
to
begin
his
story
and
gave
a
subtle
smile
come
over
here
helene
dear
said
anna
pavlovna
to
the
beautiful
young
princess
who
was
sitting
some
way
off
the
center
of
another
group
the
princess
smiled
she
rose
with
the
same
unchanging
smile
with
which
she
had
first
entered
the
room
the
smile
of
a
perfectly
beautiful
woman
with
a
slight
rustle
of
her
white
dress
trimmed
with
moss
and
ivy
with
a
gleam
of
white
shoulders
glossy
hair
and
sparkling
diamonds
she
passed
between
the
men
who
made
way
for
her
not
looking
at
any
of
them
but
smiling
on
all
as
if
graciously
allowing
each
the
privilege
of
admiring
her
beautiful
figure
and
shapely
shoulders
back
and
bosom
which
in
the
fashion
of
those
days
were
very
much
exposed
and
she
seemed
to
bring
the
glamour
of
a
ballroom
with
her
as
she
moved
toward
anna
pavlovna
helene
was
so
lovely
that
not
only
did
she
not
show
any
trace
of
coquetry
but
on
the
contrary
she
even
appeared
shy
of
her
unquestionable
and
all
too
victorious
beauty
she
seemed
to
wish
but
to
be
unable
to
diminish
its
effect
how
lovely
said
everyone
who
saw
her
and
the
vicomte
lifted
his
shoulders
and
dropped
his
eyes
as
if
startled
by
something
extraordinary
when
she
took
her
seat
opposite
and
beamed
upon
him
also
with
her
unchanging
smile
madame
i
doubt
my
ability
before
such
an
audience
said
he
smilingly
inclining
his
head
the
princess
rested
her
bare
round
arm
on
a
little
table
and
considered
a
reply
unnecessary
she
smilingly
waited
all
the
time
the
story
was
being
told
she
sat
upright
glancing
now
at
her
beautiful
round
arm
altered
in
shape
by
its
pressure
on
the
table
now
at
her
still
more
beautiful
bosom
on
which
she
readjusted
a
diamond
necklace
from
time
to
time
she
smoothed
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
whenever
the
story
produced
an
effect
she
glanced
at
anna
pavlovna
at
once
adopted
just
the
expression
she
saw
on
the
maid
of
honor
s
face
and
again
relapsed
into
her
radiant
smile
the
little
princess
had
also
left
the
tea
table
and
followed
helene
wait
a
moment
i
ll
get
my
work
now
then
what
are
you
thinking
of
she
went
on
turning
to
prince
hippolyte
fetch
me
my
workbag
there
was
a
general
movement
as
the
princess
smiling
and
talking
merrily
to
everyone
at
once
sat
down
and
gaily
arranged
herself
in
her
seat
now
i
am
all
right
she
said
and
asking
the
vicomte
to
begin
she
took
up
her
work
prince
hippolyte
having
brought
the
workbag
joined
the
circle
and
moving
a
chair
close
to
hers
seated
himself
beside
her
le
charmant
hippolyte
was
surprising
by
his
extraordinary
resemblance
to
his
beautiful
sister
but
yet
more
by
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
this
resemblance
he
was
exceedingly
ugly
his
features
were
like
his
sister
s
but
while
in
her
case
everything
was
lit
up
by
a
joyous
self
satisfied
youthful
and
constant
smile
of
animation
and
by
the
wonderful
classic
beauty
of
her
figure
his
face
on
the
contrary
was
dulled
by
imbecility
and
a
constant
expression
of
sullen
self
confidence
while
his
body
was
thin
and
weak
his
eyes
nose
and
mouth
all
seemed
puckered
into
a
vacant
wearied
grimace
and
his
arms
and
legs
always
fell
into
unnatural
positions
it
s
not
going
to
be
a
ghost
story
said
he
sitting
down
beside
the
princess
and
hastily
adjusting
his
lorgnette
as
if
without
this
instrument
he
could
not
begin
to
speak
why
no
my
dear
fellow
said
the
astonished
narrator
shrugging
his
shoulders
because
i
hate
ghost
stories
said
prince
hippolyte
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
he
only
understood
the
meaning
of
his
words
after
he
had
uttered
them
he
spoke
with
such
self
confidence
that
his
hearers
could
not
be
sure
whether
what
he
said
was
very
witty
or
very
stupid
he
was
dressed
in
a
dark
green
dress
coat
knee
breeches
of
the
color
of
cuisse
de
nymphe
effrayee
as
he
called
it
shoes
and
silk
stockings
the
vicomte
told
his
tale
very
neatly
it
was
an
anecdote
then
current
to
the
effect
that
the
duc
d
enghien
had
gone
secretly
to
paris
to
visit
mademoiselle
george
that
at
her
house
he
came
upon
bonaparte
who
also
enjoyed
the
famous
actress
favors
and
that
in
his
presence
napoleon
happened
to
fall
into
one
of
the
fainting
fits
to
which
he
was
subject
and
was
thus
at
the
duc
s
mercy
the
latter
spared
him
and
this
magnanimity
bonaparte
subsequently
repaid
by
death
the
story
was
very
pretty
and
interesting
especially
at
the
point
where
the
rivals
suddenly
recognized
one
another
and
the
ladies
looked
agitated
charming
said
anna
pavlovna
with
an
inquiring
glance
at
the
little
princess
charming
whispered
the
little
princess
sticking
the
needle
into
her
work
as
if
to
testify
that
the
interest
and
fascination
of
the
story
prevented
her
from
going
on
with
it
the
vicomte
appreciated
this
silent
praise
and
smiling
gratefully
prepared
to
continue
but
just
then
anna
pavlovna
who
had
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
the
young
man
who
so
alarmed
her
noticed
that
he
was
talking
too
loudly
and
vehemently
with
the
abbe
so
she
hurried
to
the
rescue
pierre
had
managed
to
start
a
conversation
with
the
abbe
about
the
balance
of
power
and
the
latter
evidently
interested
by
the
young
man
s
simple
minded
eagerness
was
explaining
his
pet
theory
both
were
talking
and
listening
too
eagerly
and
too
naturally
which
was
why
anna
pavlovna
disapproved
the
means
are
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
and
the
rights
of
the
people
the
abbe
was
saying
it
is
only
necessary
for
one
powerful
nation
like
russia
barbaric
as
she
is
said
to
be
to
place
herself
disinterestedly
at
the
head
of
an
alliance
having
for
its
object
the
maintenance
of
the
balance
of
power
of
europe
and
it
would
save
the
world
but
how
are
you
to
get
that
balance
pierre
was
beginning
at
that
moment
anna
pavlovna
came
up
and
looking
severely
at
pierre
asked
the
italian
how
he
stood
russian
climate
the
italian
s
face
instantly
changed
and
assumed
an
offensively
affected
sugary
expression
evidently
habitual
to
him
when
conversing
with
women
i
am
so
enchanted
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
wit
and
culture
of
the
society
more
especially
of
the
feminine
society
in
which
i
have
had
the
honor
of
being
received
that
i
have
not
yet
had
time
to
think
of
the
climate
said
he
not
letting
the
abbe
and
pierre
escape
anna
pavlovna
the
more
conveniently
to
keep
them
under
observation
brought
them
into
the
larger
circle
chapter
iv
just
then
another
visitor
entered
the
drawing
room
prince
andrew
bolkonski
the
little
princess
husband
he
was
a
very
handsome
young
man
of
medium
height
with
firm
clearcut
features
everything
about
him
from
his
weary
bored
expression
to
his
quiet
measured
step
offered
a
most
striking
contrast
to
his
quiet
little
wife
it
was
evident
that
he
not
only
knew
everyone
in
the
drawing
room
but
had
found
them
to
be
so
tiresome
that
it
wearied
him
to
look
at
or
listen
to
them
and
among
all
these
faces
that
he
found
so
tedious
none
seemed
to
bore
him
so
much
as
that
of
his
pretty
wife
he
turned
away
from
her
with
a
grimace
that
distorted
his
handsome
face
kissed
anna
pavlovna
s
hand
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
scanned
the
whole
company
you
are
off
to
the
war
prince
said
anna
pavlovna
general
kutuzov
said
bolkonski
speaking
french
and
stressing
the
last
syllable
of
the
general
s
name
like
a
frenchman
has
been
pleased
to
take
me
as
an
aide
de
camp
and
lise
your
wife
she
will
go
to
the
country
are
you
not
ashamed
to
deprive
us
of
your
charming
wife
andre
said
his
wife
addressing
her
husband
in
the
same
coquettish
manner
in
which
she
spoke
to
other
men
the
vicomte
has
been
telling
us
such
a
tale
about
mademoiselle
george
and
buonaparte
prince
andrew
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
turned
away
pierre
who
from
the
moment
prince
andrew
entered
the
room
had
watched
him
with
glad
affectionate
eyes
now
came
up
and
took
his
arm
before
he
looked
round
prince
andrew
frowned
again
expressing
his
annoyance
with
whoever
was
touching
his
arm
but
when
he
saw
pierre
s
beaming
face
he
gave
him
an
unexpectedly
kind
and
pleasant
smile
there
now
so
you
too
are
in
the
great
world
said
he
to
pierre
i
knew
you
would
be
here
replied
pierre
i
will
come
to
supper
with
you
may
i
he
added
in
a
low
voice
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
vicomte
who
was
continuing
his
story
no
impossible
said
prince
andrew
laughing
and
pressing
pierre
s
hand
to
show
that
there
was
no
need
to
ask
the
question
he
wished
to
say
something
more
but
at
that
moment
prince
vasili
and
his
daughter
got
up
to
go
and
the
two
young
men
rose
to
let
them
pass
you
must
excuse
me
dear
vicomte
said
prince
vasili
to
the
frenchman
holding
him
down
by
the
sleeve
in
a
friendly
way
to
prevent
his
rising
this
unfortunate
fete
at
the
ambassador
s
deprives
me
of
a
pleasure
and
obliges
me
to
interrupt
you
i
am
very
sorry
to
leave
your
enchanting
party
said
he
turning
to
anna
pavlovna
his
daughter
princess
helene
passed
between
the
chairs
lightly
holding
up
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
the
smile
shone
still
more
radiantly
on
her
beautiful
face
pierre
gazed
at
her
with
rapturous
almost
frightened
eyes
as
she
passed
him
very
lovely
said
prince
andrew
very
said
pierre
in
passing
prince
vasili
seized
pierre
s
hand
and
said
to
anna
pavlovna
educate
this
bear
for
me
he
has
been
staying
with
me
a
whole
month
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
him
in
society
nothing
is
so
necessary
for
a
young
man
as
the
society
of
clever
women
anna
pavlovna
smiled
and
promised
to
take
pierre
in
hand
she
knew
his
father
to
be
a
connection
of
prince
vasili
s
the
elderly
lady
who
had
been
sitting
with
the
old
aunt
rose
hurriedly
and
overtook
prince
vasili
in
the
anteroom
all
the
affectation
of
interest
she
had
assumed
had
left
her
kindly
and
tear
worn
face
and
it
now
expressed
only
anxiety
and
fear
how
about
my
son
boris
prince
said
she
hurrying
after
him
into
the
anteroom
i
can
t
remain
any
longer
in
petersburg
tell
me
what
news
i
may
take
back
to
my
poor
boy
although
prince
vasili
listened
reluctantly
and
not
very
politely
to
the
elderly
lady
even
betraying
some
impatience
she
gave
him
an
ingratiating
and
appealing
smile
and
took
his
hand
that
he
might
not
go
away
what
would
it
cost
you
to
say
a
word
to
the
emperor
and
then
he
would
be
transferred
to
the
guards
at
once
said
she
believe
me
princess
i
am
ready
to
do
all
i
can
answered
prince
vasili
but
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
ask
the
emperor
i
should
advise
you
to
appeal
to
rumyantsev
through
prince
golitsyn
that
would
be
the
best
way
the
elderly
lady
was
a
princess
drubetskaya
belonging
to
one
of
the
best
families
in
russia
but
she
was
poor
and
having
long
been
out
of
society
had
lost
her
former
influential
connections
she
had
now
come
to
petersburg
to
procure
an
appointment
in
the
guards
for
her
only
son
it
was
in
fact
solely
to
meet
prince
vasili
that
she
had
obtained
an
invitation
to
anna
pavlovna
s
reception
and
had
sat
listening
to
the
vicomte
s
story
prince
vasili
s
words
frightened
her
an
embittered
look
clouded
her
once
handsome
face
but
only
for
a
moment
then
she
smiled
again
and
clutched
prince
vasili
s
arm
more
tightly
listen
to
me
prince
said
she
i
have
never
yet
asked
you
for
anything
and
i
never
will
again
nor
have
i
ever
reminded
you
of
my
father
s
friendship
for
you
but
now
i
entreat
you
for
god
s
sake
to
do
this
for
my
son
and
i
shall
always
regard
you
as
a
benefactor
she
added
hurriedly
no
don
t
be
angry
but
promise
i
have
asked
golitsyn
and
he
has
refused
be
the
kindhearted
man
you
always
were
she
said
trying
to
smile
though
tears
were
in
her
eyes
papa
we
shall
be
late
said
princess
helene
turning
her
beautiful
head
and
looking
over
her
classically
molded
shoulder
as
she
stood
waiting
by
the
door
influence
in
society
however
is
a
capital
which
has
to
be
economized
if
it
is
to
last
prince
vasili
knew
this
and
having
once
realized
that
if
he
asked
on
behalf
of
all
who
begged
of
him
he
would
soon
be
unable
to
ask
for
himself
he
became
chary
of
using
his
influence
but
in
princess
drubetskaya
s
case
he
felt
after
her
second
appeal
something
like
qualms
of
conscience
she
had
reminded
him
of
what
was
quite
true
he
had
been
indebted
to
her
father
for
the
first
steps
in
his
career
moreover
he
could
see
by
her
manners
that
she
was
one
of
those
women
mostly
mothers
who
having
once
made
up
their
minds
will
not
rest
until
they
have
gained
their
end
and
are
prepared
if
necessary
to
go
on
insisting
day
after
day
and
hour
after
hour
and
even
to
make
scenes
this
last
consideration
moved
him
my
dear
anna
mikhaylovna
said
he
with
his
usual
familiarity
and
weariness
of
tone
it
is
almost
impossible
for
me
to
do
what
you
ask
but
to
prove
my
devotion
to
you
and
how
i
respect
your
father
s
memory
i
will
do
the
impossible
your
son
shall
be
transferred
to
the
guards
here
is
my
hand
on
it
are
you
satisfied
my
dear
benefactor
this
is
what
i
expected
from
you
i
knew
your
kindness
he
turned
to
go
wait
just
a
word
when
he
has
been
transferred
to
the
guards
she
faltered
you
are
on
good
terms
with
michael
ilarionovich
kutuzov
recommend
boris
to
him
as
adjutant
then
i
shall
be
at
rest
and
then
prince
vasili
smiled
no
i
won
t
promise
that
you
don
t
know
how
kutuzov
is
pestered
since
his
appointment
as
commander
in
chief
he
told
me
himself
that
all
the
moscow
ladies
have
conspired
to
give
him
all
their
sons
as
adjutants
no
but
do
promise
i
won
t
let
you
go
my
dear
benefactor
papa
said
his
beautiful
daughter
in
the
same
tone
as
before
we
shall
be
late
well
au
revoir
good
by
you
hear
her
then
tomorrow
you
will
speak
to
the
emperor
certainly
but
about
kutuzov
i
don
t
promise
do
promise
do
promise
vasili
cried
anna
mikhaylovna
as
he
went
with
the
smile
of
a
coquettish
girl
which
at
one
time
probably
came
naturally
to
her
but
was
now
very
ill
suited
to
her
careworn
face
apparently
she
had
forgotten
her
age
and
by
force
of
habit
employed
all
the
old
feminine
arts
but
as
soon
as
the
prince
had
gone
her
face
resumed
its
former
cold
artificial
expression
she
returned
to
the
group
where
the
vicomte
was
still
talking
and
again
pretended
to
listen
while
waiting
till
it
would
be
time
to
leave
her
task
was
accomplished
chapter
v
and
what
do
you
think
of
this
latest
comedy
the
coronation
at
milan
asked
anna
pavlovna
and
of
the
comedy
of
the
people
of
genoa
and
lucca
laying
their
petitions
before
monsieur
buonaparte
and
monsieur
buonaparte
sitting
on
a
throne
and
granting
the
petitions
of
the
nations
adorable
it
is
enough
to
make
one
s
head
whirl
it
is
as
if
the
whole
world
had
gone
crazy
prince
andrew
looked
anna
pavlovna
straight
in
the
face
with
a
sarcastic
smile
dieu
me
la
donne
gare
a
qui
la
touche
they
say
he
was
very
fine
when
he
said
that
he
remarked
repeating
the
words
in
italian
dio
mi
l
ha
dato
guai
a
chi
la
tocchi
god
has
given
it
to
me
let
him
who
touches
it
beware
i
hope
this
will
prove
the
last
drop
that
will
make
the
glass
run
over
anna
pavlovna
continued
the
sovereigns
will
not
be
able
to
endure
this
man
who
is
a
menace
to
everything
the
sovereigns
i
do
not
speak
of
russia
said
the
vicomte
polite
but
hopeless
the
sovereigns
madame
what
have
they
done
for
louis
xvii
for
the
queen
or
for
madame
elizabeth
nothing
and
he
became
more
animated
and
believe
me
they
are
reaping
the
reward
of
their
betrayal
of
the
bourbon
cause
the
sovereigns
why
they
are
sending
ambassadors
to
compliment
the
usurper
and
sighing
disdainfully
he
again
changed
his
position
prince
hippolyte
who
had
been
gazing
at
the
vicomte
for
some
time
through
his
lorgnette
suddenly
turned
completely
round
toward
the
little
princess
and
having
asked
for
a
needle
began
tracing
the
conde
coat
of
arms
on
the
table
he
explained
this
to
her
with
as
much
gravity
as
if
she
had
asked
him
to
do
it
baton
de
gueules
engrele
de
gueules
d
azur
maison
conde
said
he
the
princess
listened
smiling
if
buonaparte
remains
on
the
throne
of
france
a
year
longer
the
vicomte
continued
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
in
a
matter
with
which
he
is
better
acquainted
than
anyone
else
does
not
listen
to
others
but
follows
the
current
of
his
own
thoughts
things
will
have
gone
too
far
by
intrigues
violence
exile
and
executions
french
society
i
mean
good
french
society
will
have
been
forever
destroyed
and
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
hands
pierre
wished
to
make
a
remark
for
the
conversation
interested
him
but
anna
pavlovna
who
had
him
under
observation
interrupted
the
emperor
alexander
said
she
with
the
melancholy
which
always
accompanied
any
reference
of
hers
to
the
imperial
family
has
declared
that
he
will
leave
it
to
the
french
people
themselves
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
and
i
believe
that
once
free
from
the
usurper
the
whole
nation
will
certainly
throw
itself
into
the
arms
of
its
rightful
king
she
concluded
trying
to
be
amiable
to
the
royalist
emigrant
that
is
doubtful
said
prince
andrew
monsieur
le
vicomte
quite
rightly
supposes
that
matters
have
already
gone
too
far
i
think
it
will
be
difficult
to
return
to
the
old
regime
from
what
i
have
heard
said
pierre
blushing
and
breaking
into
the
conversation
almost
all
the
aristocracy
has
already
gone
over
to
bonaparte
s
side
it
is
the
buonapartists
who
say
that
replied
the
vicomte
without
looking
at
pierre
at
the
present
time
it
is
difficult
to
know
the
real
state
of
french
public
opinion
bonaparte
has
said
so
remarked
prince
andrew
with
a
sarcastic
smile
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
like
the
vicomte
and
was
aiming
his
remarks
at
him
though
without
looking
at
him
i
showed
them
the
path
to
glory
but
they
did
not
follow
it
prince
andrew
continued
after
a
short
silence
again
quoting
napoleon
s
words
i
opened
my
antechambers
and
they
crowded
in
i
do
not
know
how
far
he
was
justified
in
saying
so
not
in
the
least
replied
the
vicomte
after
the
murder
of
the
duc
even
the
most
partial
ceased
to
regard
him
as
a
hero
if
to
some
people
he
went
on
turning
to
anna
pavlovna
he
ever
was
a
hero
after
the
murder
of
the
duc
there
was
one
martyr
more
in
heaven
and
one
hero
less
on
earth
before
anna
pavlovna
and
the
others
had
time
to
smile
their
appreciation
of
the
vicomte
s
epigram
pierre
again
broke
into
the
conversation
and
though
anna
pavlovna
felt
sure
he
would
say
something
inappropriate
she
was
unable
to
stop
him
the
execution
of
the
duc
d
enghien
declared
monsieur
pierre
was
a
political
necessity
and
it
seems
to
me
that
napoleon
showed
greatness
of
soul
by
not
fearing
to
take
on
himself
the
whole
responsibility
of
that
deed
dieu
mon
dieu
muttered
anna
pavlovna
in
a
terrified
whisper
what
monsieur
pierre
do
you
consider
that
assassination
shows
greatness
of
soul
said
the
little
princess
smiling
and
drawing
her
work
nearer
to
her
oh
oh
exclaimed
several
voices
capital
said
prince
hippolyte
in
english
and
began
slapping
his
knee
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
the
vicomte
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
pierre
looked
solemnly
at
his
audience
over
his
spectacles
and
continued
i
say
so
he
continued
desperately
because
the
bourbons
fled
from
the
revolution
leaving
the
people
to
anarchy
and
napoleon
alone
understood
the
revolution
and
quelled
it
and
so
for
the
general
good
he
could
not
stop
short
for
the
sake
of
one
man
s
life
won
t
you
come
over
to
the
other
table
suggested
anna
pavlovna
but
pierre
continued
his
speech
without
heeding
her
no
cried
he
becoming
more
and
more
eager
napoleon
is
great
because
he
rose
superior
to
the
revolution
suppressed
its
abuses
preserved
all
that
was
good
in
it
equality
of
citizenship
and
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press
and
only
for
that
reason
did
he
obtain
power
yes
if
having
obtained
power
without
availing
himself
of
it
to
commit
murder
he
had
restored
it
to
the
rightful
king
i
should
have
called
him
a
great
man
remarked
the
vicomte
he
could
not
do
that
the
people
only
gave
him
power
that
he
might
rid
them
of
the
bourbons
and
because
they
saw
that
he
was
a
great
man
the
revolution
was
a
grand
thing
continued
monsieur
pierre
betraying
by
this
desperate
and
provocative
proposition
his
extreme
youth
and
his
wish
to
express
all
that
was
in
his
mind
what
revolution
and
regicide
a
grand
thing
well
after
that
but
won
t
you
come
to
this
other
table
repeated
anna
pavlovna
rousseau
s
contrat
social
said
the
vicomte
with
a
tolerant
smile
i
am
not
speaking
of
regicide
i
am
speaking
about
ideas
yes
ideas
of
robbery
murder
and
regicide
again
interjected
an
ironical
voice
those
were
extremes
no
doubt
but
they
are
not
what
is
most
important
what
is
important
are
the
rights
of
man
emancipation
from
prejudices
and
equality
of
citizenship
and
all
these
ideas
napoleon
has
retained
in
full
force
liberty
and
equality
said
the
vicomte
contemptuously
as
if
at
last
deciding
seriously
to
prove
to
this
youth
how
foolish
his
words
were
high
sounding
words
which
have
long
been
discredited
who
does
not
love
liberty
and
equality
even
our
saviour
preached
liberty
and
equality
have
people
since
the
revolution
become
happier
on
the
contrary
we
wanted
liberty
but
buonaparte
has
destroyed
it
prince
andrew
kept
looking
with
an
amused
smile
from
pierre
to
the
vicomte
and
from
the
vicomte
to
their
hostess
in
the
first
moment
of
pierre
s
outburst
anna
pavlovna
despite
her
social
experience
was
horror
struck
but
when
she
saw
that
pierre
s
sacrilegious
words
had
not
exasperated
the
vicomte
and
had
convinced
herself
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
him
she
rallied
her
forces
and
joined
the
vicomte
in
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
orator
but
my
dear
monsieur
pierre
said
she
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
of
a
great
man
executing
a
duc
or
even
an
ordinary
man
who
is
innocent
and
untried
i
should
like
said
the
vicomte
to
ask
how
monsieur
explains
the
th
brumaire
was
not
that
an
imposture
it
was
a
swindle
and
not
at
all
like
the
conduct
of
a
great
man
and
the
prisoners
he
killed
in
africa
that
was
horrible
said
the
little
princess
shrugging
her
shoulders
he
s
a
low
fellow
say
what
you
will
remarked
prince
hippolyte
pierre
not
knowing
whom
to
answer
looked
at
them
all
and
smiled
his
smile
was
unlike
the
half
smile
of
other
people
when
he
smiled
his
grave
even
rather
gloomy
look
was
instantaneously
replaced
by
another
a
childlike
kindly
even
rather
silly
look
which
seemed
to
ask
forgiveness
the
vicomte
who
was
meeting
him
for
the
first
time
saw
clearly
that
this
young
jacobin
was
not
so
terrible
as
his
words
suggested
all
were
silent
how
do
you
expect
him
to
answer
you
all
at
once
said
prince
andrew
besides
in
the
actions
of
a
statesman
one
has
to
distinguish
between
his
acts
as
a
private
person
as
a
general
and
as
an
emperor
so
it
seems
to
me
yes
yes
of
course
pierre
chimed
in
pleased
at
the
arrival
of
this
reinforcement
one
must
admit
continued
prince
andrew
that
napoleon
as
a
man
was
great
on
the
bridge
of
arcola
and
in
the
hospital
at
jaffa
where
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
plague
stricken
but
but
there
are
other
acts
which
it
is
difficult
to
justify
prince
andrew
who
had
evidently
wished
to
tone
down
the
awkwardness
of
pierre
s
remarks
rose
and
made
a
sign
to
his
wife
that
it
was
time
to
go
suddenly
prince
hippolyte
started
up
making
signs
to
everyone
to
attend
and
asking
them
all
to
be
seated
began
i
was
told
a
charming
moscow
story
today
and
must
treat
you
to
it
excuse
me
vicomte
i
must
tell
it
in
russian
or
the
point
will
be
lost
and
prince
hippolyte
began
to
tell
his
story
in
such
russian
as
a
frenchman
would
speak
after
spending
about
a
year
in
russia
everyone
waited
so
emphatically
and
eagerly
did
he
demand
their
attention
to
his
story
there
is
in
moscow
a
lady
une
dame
and
she
is
very
stingy
she
must
have
two
footmen
behind
her
carriage
and
very
big
ones
that
was
her
taste
and
she
had
a
lady
s
maid
also
big
she
said
here
prince
hippolyte
paused
evidently
collecting
his
ideas
with
difficulty
she
said
oh
yes
she
said
girl
to
the
maid
put
on
a
livery
get
up
behind
the
carriage
and
come
with
me
while
i
make
some
calls
here
prince
hippolyte
spluttered
and
burst
out
laughing
long
before
his
audience
which
produced
an
effect
unfavorable
to
the
narrator
several
persons
among
them
the
elderly
lady
and
anna
pavlovna
did
however
smile
she
went
suddenly
there
was
a
great
wind
the
girl
lost
her
hat
and
her
long
hair
came
down
here
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
went
on
between
gasps
of
laughter
and
the
whole
world
knew
and
so
the
anecdote
ended
though
it
was
unintelligible
why
he
had
told
it
or
why
it
had
to
be
told
in
russian
still
anna
pavlovna
and
the
others
appreciated
prince
hippolyte
s
social
tact
in
so
agreeably
ending
pierre
s
unpleasant
and
unamiable
outburst
after
the
anecdote
the
conversation
broke
up
into
insignificant
small
talk
about
the
last
and
next
balls
about
theatricals
and
who
would
meet
whom
and
when
and
where
chapter
vi
having
thanked
anna
pavlovna
for
her
charming
soiree
the
guests
began
to
take
their
leave
pierre
was
ungainly
stout
about
the
average
height
broad
with
huge
red
hands
he
did
not
know
as
the
saying
is
how
to
enter
a
drawing
room
and
still
less
how
to
leave
one
that
is
how
to
say
something
particularly
agreeable
before
going
away
besides
this
he
was
absent
minded
when
he
rose
to
go
he
took
up
instead
of
his
own
the
general
s
three
cornered
hat
and
held
it
pulling
at
the
plume
till
the
general
asked
him
to
restore
it
all
his
absent
mindedness
and
inability
to
enter
a
room
and
converse
in
it
was
however
redeemed
by
his
kindly
simple
and
modest
expression
anna
pavlovna
turned
toward
him
and
with
a
christian
mildness
that
expressed
forgiveness
of
his
indiscretion
nodded
and
said
i
hope
to
see
you
again
but
i
also
hope
you
will
change
your
opinions
my
dear
monsieur
pierre
when
she
said
this
he
did
not
reply
and
only
bowed
but
again
everybody
saw
his
smile
which
said
nothing
unless
perhaps
opinions
are
opinions
but
you
see
what
a
capital
good
natured
fellow
i
am
and
everyone
including
anna
pavlovna
felt
this
prince
andrew
had
gone
out
into
the
hall
and
turning
his
shoulders
to
the
footman
who
was
helping
him
on
with
his
cloak
listened
indifferently
to
his
wife
s
chatter
with
prince
hippolyte
who
had
also
come
into
the
hall
prince
hippolyte
stood
close
to
the
pretty
pregnant
princess
and
stared
fixedly
at
her
through
his
eyeglass
go
in
annette
or
you
will
catch
cold
said
the
little
princess
taking
leave
of
anna
pavlovna
it
is
settled
she
added
in
a
low
voice
anna
pavlovna
had
already
managed
to
speak
to
lise
about
the
match
she
contemplated
between
anatole
and
the
little
princess
sister
in
law
i
rely
on
you
my
dear
said
anna
pavlovna
also
in
a
low
tone
write
to
her
and
let
me
know
how
her
father
looks
at
the
matter
au
revoir
and
she
left
the
hall
prince
hippolyte
approached
the
little
princess
and
bending
his
face
close
to
her
began
to
whisper
something
two
footmen
the
princess
and
his
own
stood
holding
a
shawl
and
a
cloak
waiting
for
the
conversation
to
finish
they
listened
to
the
french
sentences
which
to
them
were
meaningless
with
an
air
of
understanding
but
not
wishing
to
appear
to
do
so
the
princess
as
usual
spoke
smilingly
and
listened
with
a
laugh
i
am
very
glad
i
did
not
go
to
the
ambassador
s
said
prince
hippolyte
so
dull
it
has
been
a
delightful
evening
has
it
not
delightful
they
say
the
ball
will
be
very
good
replied
the
princess
drawing
up
her
downy
little
lip
all
the
pretty
women
in
society
will
be
there
not
all
for
you
will
not
be
there
not
all
said
prince
hippolyte
smiling
joyfully
and
snatching
the
shawl
from
the
footman
whom
he
even
pushed
aside
he
began
wrapping
it
round
the
princess
either
from
awkwardness
or
intentionally
no
one
could
have
said
which
after
the
shawl
had
been
adjusted
he
kept
his
arm
around
her
for
a
long
time
as
though
embracing
her
still
smiling
she
gracefully
moved
away
turning
and
glancing
at
her
husband
prince
andrew
s
eyes
were
closed
so
weary
and
sleepy
did
he
seem
are
you
ready
he
asked
his
wife
looking
past
her
prince
hippolyte
hurriedly
put
on
his
cloak
which
in
the
latest
fashion
reached
to
his
very
heels
and
stumbling
in
it
ran
out
into
the
porch
following
the
princess
whom
a
footman
was
helping
into
the
carriage
princesse
au
revoir
cried
he
stumbling
with
his
tongue
as
well
as
with
his
feet
the
princess
picking
up
her
dress
was
taking
her
seat
in
the
dark
carriage
her
husband
was
adjusting
his
saber
prince
hippolyte
under
pretense
of
helping
was
in
everyone
s
way
allow
me
sir
said
prince
andrew
in
russian
in
a
cold
disagreeable
tone
to
prince
hippolyte
who
was
blocking
his
path
i
am
expecting
you
pierre
said
the
same
voice
but
gently
and
affectionately
the
postilion
started
the
carriage
wheels
rattled
prince
hippolyte
laughed
spasmodically
as
he
stood
in
the
porch
waiting
for
the
vicomte
whom
he
had
promised
to
take
home
well
mon
cher
said
the
vicomte
having
seated
himself
beside
hippolyte
in
the
carriage
your
little
princess
is
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
quite
french
and
he
kissed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
hippolyte
burst
out
laughing
do
you
know
you
are
a
terrible
chap
for
all
your
innocent
airs
continued
the
vicomte
i
pity
the
poor
husband
that
little
officer
who
gives
himself
the
airs
of
a
monarch
hippolyte
spluttered
again
and
amid
his
laughter
said
and
you
were
saying
that
the
russian
ladies
are
not
equal
to
the
french
one
has
to
know
how
to
deal
with
them
pierre
reaching
the
house
first
went
into
prince
andrew
s
study
like
one
quite
at
home
and
from
habit
immediately
lay
down
on
the
sofa
took
from
the
shelf
the
first
book
that
came
to
his
hand
it
was
caesar
s
commentaries
and
resting
on
his
elbow
began
reading
it
in
the
middle
what
have
you
done
to
mlle
scherer
she
will
be
quite
ill
now
said
prince
andrew
as
he
entered
the
study
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
pierre
turned
his
whole
body
making
the
sofa
creak
he
lifted
his
eager
face
to
prince
andrew
smiled
and
waved
his
hand
that
abbe
is
very
interesting
but
he
does
not
see
the
thing
in
the
right
light
in
my
opinion
perpetual
peace
is
possible
but
i
do
not
know
how
to
express
it
not
by
a
balance
of
political
power
it
was
evident
that
prince
andrew
was
not
interested
in
such
abstract
conversation
one
can
t
everywhere
say
all
one
thinks
mon
cher
well
have
you
at
last
decided
on
anything
are
you
going
to
be
a
guardsman
or
a
diplomatist
asked
prince
andrew
after
a
momentary
silence
pierre
sat
up
on
the
sofa
with
his
legs
tucked
under
him
really
i
don
t
yet
know
i
don
t
like
either
the
one
or
the
other
but
you
must
decide
on
something
your
father
expects
it
pierre
at
the
age
of
ten
had
been
sent
abroad
with
an
abbe
as
tutor
and
had
remained
away
till
he
was
twenty
when
he
returned
to
moscow
his
father
dismissed
the
abbe
and
said
to
the
young
man
now
go
to
petersburg
look
round
and
choose
your
profession
i
will
agree
to
anything
here
is
a
letter
to
prince
vasili
and
here
is
money
write
to
me
all
about
it
and
i
will
help
you
in
everything
pierre
had
already
been
choosing
a
career
for
three
months
and
had
not
decided
on
anything
it
was
about
this
choice
that
prince
andrew
was
speaking
pierre
rubbed
his
forehead
but
he
must
be
a
freemason
said
he
referring
to
the
abbe
whom
he
had
met
that
evening
that
is
all
nonsense
prince
andrew
again
interrupted
him
let
us
talk
business
have
you
been
to
the
horse
guards
no
i
have
not
but
this
is
what
i
have
been
thinking
and
wanted
to
tell
you
there
is
a
war
now
against
napoleon
if
it
were
a
war
for
freedom
i
could
understand
it
and
should
be
the
first
to
enter
the
army
but
to
help
england
and
austria
against
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
is
not
right
prince
andrew
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
pierre
s
childish
words
he
put
on
the
air
of
one
who
finds
it
impossible
to
reply
to
such
nonsense
but
it
would
in
fact
have
been
difficult
to
give
any
other
answer
than
the
one
prince
andrew
gave
to
this
naive
question
if
no
one
fought
except
on
his
own
conviction
there
would
be
no
wars
he
said
and
that
would
be
splendid
said
pierre
prince
andrew
smiled
ironically
very
likely
it
would
be
splendid
but
it
will
never
come
about
well
why
are
you
going
to
the
war
asked
pierre
what
for
i
don
t
know
i
must
besides
that
i
am
going
he
paused
i
am
going
because
the
life
i
am
leading
here
does
not
suit
me
chapter
vii
the
rustle
of
a
woman
s
dress
was
heard
in
the
next
room
prince
andrew
shook
himself
as
if
waking
up
and
his
face
assumed
the
look
it
had
had
in
anna
pavlovna
s
drawing
room
pierre
removed
his
feet
from
the
sofa
the
princess
came
in
she
had
changed
her
gown
for
a
house
dress
as
fresh
and
elegant
as
the
other
prince
andrew
rose
and
politely
placed
a
chair
for
her
how
is
it
she
began
as
usual
in
french
settling
down
briskly
and
fussily
in
the
easy
chair
how
is
it
annette
never
got
married
how
stupid
you
men
all
are
not
to
have
married
her
excuse
me
for
saying
so
but
you
have
no
sense
about
women
what
an
argumentative
fellow
you
are
monsieur
pierre
and
i
am
still
arguing
with
your
husband
i
can
t
understand
why
he
wants
to
go
to
the
war
replied
pierre
addressing
the
princess
with
none
of
the
embarrassment
so
commonly
shown
by
young
men
in
their
intercourse
with
young
women
the
princess
started
evidently
pierre
s
words
touched
her
to
the
quick
ah
that
is
just
what
i
tell
him
said
she
i
don
t
understand
it
i
don
t
in
the
least
understand
why
men
can
t
live
without
wars
how
is
it
that
we
women
don
t
want
anything
of
the
kind
don
t
need
it
now
you
shall
judge
between
us
i
always
tell
him
here
he
is
uncle
s
aide
de
camp
a
most
brilliant
position
he
is
so
well
known
so
much
appreciated
by
everyone
the
other
day
at
the
apraksins
i
heard
a
lady
asking
is
that
the
famous
prince
andrew
i
did
indeed
she
laughed
he
is
so
well
received
everywhere
he
might
easily
become
aide
de
camp
to
the
emperor
you
know
the
emperor
spoke
to
him
most
graciously
annette
and
i
were
speaking
of
how
to
arrange
it
what
do
you
think
pierre
looked
at
his
friend
and
noticing
that
he
did
not
like
the
conversation
gave
no
reply
when
are
you
starting
he
asked
oh
don
t
speak
of
his
going
don
t
i
won
t
hear
it
spoken
of
said
the
princess
in
the
same
petulantly
playful
tone
in
which
she
had
spoken
to
hippolyte
in
the
drawing
room
and
which
was
so
plainly
ill
suited
to
the
family
circle
of
which
pierre
was
almost
a
member
today
when
i
remembered
that
all
these
delightful
associations
must
be
broken
off
and
then
you
know
andre
she
looked
significantly
at
her
husband
i
m
afraid
i
m
afraid
she
whispered
and
a
shudder
ran
down
her
back
her
husband
looked
at
her
as
if
surprised
to
notice
that
someone
besides
pierre
and
himself
was
in
the
room
and
addressed
her
in
a
tone
of
frigid
politeness
what
is
it
you
are
afraid
of
lise
i
don
t
understand
said
he
there
what
egotists
men
all
are
all
all
egotists
just
for
a
whim
of
his
own
goodness
only
knows
why
he
leaves
me
and
locks
me
up
alone
in
the
country
with
my
father
and
sister
remember
said
prince
andrew
gently
alone
all
the
same
without
my
friends
and
he
expects
me
not
to
be
afraid
her
tone
was
now
querulous
and
her
lip
drawn
up
giving
her
not
a
joyful
but
an
animal
squirrel
like
expression
she
paused
as
if
she
felt
it
indecorous
to
speak
of
her
pregnancy
before
pierre
though
the
gist
of
the
matter
lay
in
that
i
still
can
t
understand
what
you
are
afraid
of
said
prince
andrew
slowly
not
taking
his
eyes
off
his
wife
the
princess
blushed
and
raised
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
despair
no
andrew
i
must
say
you
have
changed
oh
how
you
have
your
doctor
tells
you
to
go
to
bed
earlier
said
prince
andrew
you
had
better
go
the
princess
said
nothing
but
suddenly
her
short
downy
lip
quivered
prince
andrew
rose
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
about
the
room
pierre
looked
over
his
spectacles
with
naive
surprise
now
at
him
and
now
at
her
moved
as
if
about
to
rise
too
but
changed
his
mind
why
should
i
mind
monsieur
pierre
being
here
exclaimed
the
little
princess
suddenly
her
pretty
face
all
at
once
distorted
by
a
tearful
grimace
i
have
long
wanted
to
ask
you
andrew
why
you
have
changed
so
to
me
what
have
i
done
to
you
you
are
going
to
the
war
and
have
no
pity
for
me
why
is
it
lise
was
all
prince
andrew
said
but
that
one
word
expressed
an
entreaty
a
threat
and
above
all
conviction
that
she
would
herself
regret
her
words
but
she
went
on
hurriedly
you
treat
me
like
an
invalid
or
a
child
i
see
it
all
did
you
behave
like
that
six
months
ago
lise
i
beg
you
to
desist
said
prince
andrew
still
more
emphatically
pierre
who
had
been
growing
more
and
more
agitated
as
he
listened
to
all
this
rose
and
approached
the
princess
he
seemed
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
tears
and
was
ready
to
cry
himself
calm
yourself
princess
it
seems
so
to
you
because
i
assure
you
i
myself
have
experienced
and
so
because
no
excuse
me
an
outsider
is
out
of
place
here
no
don
t
distress
yourself
good
by
prince
andrew
caught
him
by
the
hand
no
wait
pierre
the
princess
is
too
kind
to
wish
to
deprive
me
of
the
pleasure
of
spending
the
evening
with
you
no
he
thinks
only
of
himself
muttered
the
princess
without
restraining
her
angry
tears
lise
said
prince
andrew
dryly
raising
his
voice
to
the
pitch
which
indicates
that
patience
is
exhausted
suddenly
the
angry
squirrel
like
expression
of
the
princess
pretty
face
changed
into
a
winning
and
piteous
look
of
fear
her
beautiful
eyes
glanced
askance
at
her
husband
s
face
and
her
own
assumed
the
timid
deprecating
expression
of
a
dog
when
it
rapidly
but
feebly
wags
its
drooping
tail
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
she
muttered
and
lifting
her
dress
with
one
hand
she
went
up
to
her
husband
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
good
night
lise
said
he
rising
and
courteously
kissing
her
hand
as
he
would
have
done
to
a
stranger
chapter
viii
the
friends
were
silent
neither
cared
to
begin
talking
pierre
continually
glanced
at
prince
andrew
prince
andrew
rubbed
his
forehead
with
his
small
hand
let
us
go
and
have
supper
he
said
with
a
sigh
going
to
the
door
they
entered
the
elegant
newly
decorated
and
luxurious
dining
room
everything
from
the
table
napkins
to
the
silver
china
and
glass
bore
that
imprint
of
newness
found
in
the
households
of
the
newly
married
halfway
through
supper
prince
andrew
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
with
a
look
of
nervous
agitation
such
as
pierre
had
never
before
seen
on
his
face
began
to
talk
as
one
who
has
long
had
something
on
his
mind
and
suddenly
determines
to
speak
out
never
never
marry
my
dear
fellow
that
s
my
advice
never
marry
till
you
can
say
to
yourself
that
you
have
done
all
you
are
capable
of
and
until
you
have
ceased
to
love
the
woman
of
your
choice
and
have
seen
her
plainly
as
she
is
or
else
you
will
make
a
cruel
and
irrevocable
mistake
marry
when
you
are
old
and
good
for
nothing
or
all
that
is
good
and
noble
in
you
will
be
lost
it
will
all
be
wasted
on
trifles
yes
yes
yes
don
t
look
at
me
with
such
surprise
if
you
marry
expecting
anything
from
yourself
in
the
future
you
will
feel
at
every
step
that
for
you
all
is
ended
all
is
closed
except
the
drawing
room
where
you
will
be
ranged
side
by
side
with
a
court
lackey
and
an
idiot
but
what
s
the
good
and
he
waved
his
arm
pierre
took
off
his
spectacles
which
made
his
face
seem
different
and
the
good
natured
expression
still
more
apparent
and
gazed
at
his
friend
in
amazement
my
wife
continued
prince
andrew
is
an
excellent
woman
one
of
those
rare
women
with
whom
a
man
s
honor
is
safe
but
o
god
what
would
i
not
give
now
to
be
unmarried
you
are
the
first
and
only
one
to
whom
i
mention
this
because
i
like
you
as
he
said
this
prince
andrew
was
less
than
ever
like
that
bolkonski
who
had
lolled
in
anna
pavlovna
s
easy
chairs
and
with
half
closed
eyes
had
uttered
french
phrases
between
his
teeth
every
muscle
of
his
thin
face
was
now
quivering
with
nervous
excitement
his
eyes
in
which
the
fire
of
life
had
seemed
extinguished
now
flashed
with
brilliant
light
it
was
evident
that
the
more
lifeless
he
seemed
at
ordinary
times
the
more
impassioned
he
became
in
these
moments
of
almost
morbid
irritation
you
don
t
understand
why
i
say
this
he
continued
but
it
is
the
whole
story
of
life
you
talk
of
bonaparte
and
his
career
said
he
though
pierre
had
not
mentioned
bonaparte
but
bonaparte
when
he
worked
went
step
by
step
toward
his
goal
he
was
free
he
had
nothing
but
his
aim
to
consider
and
he
reached
it
but
tie
yourself
up
with
a
woman
and
like
a
chained
convict
you
lose
all
freedom
and
all
you
have
of
hope
and
strength
merely
weighs
you
down
and
torments
you
with
regret
drawing
rooms
gossip
balls
vanity
and
triviality
these
are
the
enchanted
circle
i
cannot
escape
from
i
am
now
going
to
the
war
the
greatest
war
there
ever
was
and
i
know
nothing
and
am
fit
for
nothing
i
am
very
amiable
and
have
a
caustic
wit
continued
prince
andrew
and
at
anna
pavlovna
s
they
listen
to
me
and
that
stupid
set
without
whom
my
wife
cannot
exist
and
those
women
if
you
only
knew
what
those
society
women
are
and
women
in
general
my
father
is
right
selfish
vain
stupid
trivial
in
everything
that
s
what
women
are
when
you
see
them
in
their
true
colors
when
you
meet
them
in
society
it
seems
as
if
there
were
something
in
them
but
there
s
nothing
nothing
nothing
no
don
t
marry
my
dear
fellow
don
t
marry
concluded
prince
andrew
it
seems
funny
to
me
said
pierre
that
you
you
should
consider
yourself
incapable
and
your
life
a
spoiled
life
you
have
everything
before
you
everything
and
you
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
his
tone
showed
how
highly
he
thought
of
his
friend
and
how
much
he
expected
of
him
in
the
future
how
can
he
talk
like
that
thought
pierre
he
considered
his
friend
a
model
of
perfection
because
prince
andrew
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
just
the
very
qualities
pierre
lacked
and
which
might
be
best
described
as
strength
of
will
pierre
was
always
astonished
at
prince
andrew
s
calm
manner
of
treating
everybody
his
extraordinary
memory
his
extensive
reading
he
had
read
everything
knew
everything
and
had
an
opinion
about
everything
but
above
all
at
his
capacity
for
work
and
study
and
if
pierre
was
often
struck
by
andrew
s
lack
of
capacity
for
philosophical
meditation
to
which
he
himself
was
particularly
addicted
he
regarded
even
this
not
as
a
defect
but
as
a
sign
of
strength
even
in
the
best
most
friendly
and
simplest
relations
of
life
praise
and
commendation
are
essential
just
as
grease
is
necessary
to
wheels
that
they
may
run
smoothly
my
part
is
played
out
said
prince
andrew
what
s
the
use
of
talking
about
me
let
us
talk
about
you
he
added
after
a
silence
smiling
at
his
reassuring
thoughts
that
smile
was
immediately
reflected
on
pierre
s
face
but
what
is
there
to
say
about
me
said
pierre
his
face
relaxing
into
a
careless
merry
smile
what
am
i
an
illegitimate
son
he
suddenly
blushed
crimson
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
made
a
great
effort
to
say
this
without
a
name
and
without
means
and
it
really
but
he
did
not
say
what
it
really
was
for
the
present
i
am
free
and
am
all
right
only
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
what
i
am
to
do
i
wanted
to
consult
you
seriously
prince
andrew
looked
kindly
at
him
yet
his
glance
friendly
and
affectionate
as
it
was
expressed
a
sense
of
his
own
superiority
i
am
fond
of
you
especially
as
you
are
the
one
live
man
among
our
whole
set
yes
you
re
all
right
choose
what
you
will
it
s
all
the
same
you
ll
be
all
right
anywhere
but
look
here
give
up
visiting
those
kuragins
and
leading
that
sort
of
life
it
suits
you
so
badly
all
this
debauchery
dissipation
and
the
rest
of
it
what
would
you
have
my
dear
fellow
answered
pierre
shrugging
his
shoulders
women
my
dear
fellow
women
i
don
t
understand
it
replied
prince
andrew
women
who
are
comme
il
faut
that
s
a
different
matter
but
the
kuragins
set
of
women
women
and
wine
i
don
t
understand
pierre
was
staying
at
prince
vasili
kuragin
s
and
sharing
the
dissipated
life
of
his
son
anatole
the
son
whom
they
were
planning
to
reform
by
marrying
him
to
prince
andrew
s
sister
do
you
know
said
pierre
as
if
suddenly
struck
by
a
happy
thought
seriously
i
have
long
been
thinking
of
it
leading
such
a
life
i
can
t
decide
or
think
properly
about
anything
one
s
head
aches
and
one
spends
all
one
s
money
he
asked
me
for
tonight
but
i
won
t
go
you
give
me
your
word
of
honor
not
to
go
on
my
honor
chapter
ix
it
was
past
one
o
clock
when
pierre
left
his
friend
it
was
a
cloudless
northern
summer
night
pierre
took
an
open
cab
intending
to
drive
straight
home
but
the
nearer
he
drew
to
the
house
the
more
he
felt
the
impossibility
of
going
to
sleep
on
such
a
night
it
was
light
enough
to
see
a
long
way
in
the
deserted
street
and
it
seemed
more
like
morning
or
evening
than
night
on
the
way
pierre
remembered
that
anatole
kuragin
was
expecting
the
usual
set
for
cards
that
evening
after
which
there
was
generally
a
drinking
bout
finishing
with
visits
of
a
kind
pierre
was
very
fond
of
i
should
like
to
go
to
kuragin
s
thought
he
but
he
immediately
recalled
his
promise
to
prince
andrew
not
to
go
there
then
as
happens
to
people
of
weak
character
he
desired
so
passionately
once
more
to
enjoy
that
dissipation
he
was
so
accustomed
to
that
he
decided
to
go
the
thought
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
his
promise
to
prince
andrew
was
of
no
account
because
before
he
gave
it
he
had
already
promised
prince
anatole
to
come
to
his
gathering
besides
thought
he
all
such
words
of
honor
are
conventional
things
with
no
definite
meaning
especially
if
one
considers
that
by
tomorrow
one
may
be
dead
or
something
so
extraordinary
may
happen
to
one
that
honor
and
dishonor
will
be
all
the
same
pierre
often
indulged
in
reflections
of
this
sort
nullifying
all
his
decisions
and
intentions
he
went
to
kuragin
s
reaching
the
large
house
near
the
horse
guards
barracks
in
which
anatole
lived
pierre
entered
the
lighted
porch
ascended
the
stairs
and
went
in
at
the
open
door
there
was
no
one
in
the
anteroom
empty
bottles
cloaks
and
overshoes
were
lying
about
there
was
a
smell
of
alcohol
and
sounds
of
voices
and
shouting
in
the
distance
cards
and
supper
were
over
but
the
visitors
had
not
yet
dispersed
pierre
threw
off
his
cloak
and
entered
the
first
room
in
which
were
the
remains
of
supper
a
footman
thinking
no
one
saw
him
was
drinking
on
the
sly
what
was
left
in
the
glasses
from
the
third
room
came
sounds
of
laughter
the
shouting
of
familiar
voices
the
growling
of
a
bear
and
general
commotion
some
eight
or
nine
young
men
were
crowding
anxiously
round
an
open
window
three
others
were
romping
with
a
young
bear
one
pulling
him
by
the
chain
and
trying
to
set
him
at
the
others
i
bet
a
hundred

one

another

the
host
a
tall
handsome
fellow
who
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
group
without
a
coat
and
with
his
fine
linen
shirt
unfastened
in
front
wait
a
bit

cried
he
addressing
pierre
another
voice
from
a
man
of
medium
height
with
clear
blue
eyes
particularly
striking
among
all
these
drunken
voices
by
its
sober
ring
cried
from
the
window
come

part
the
bets
this
was
dolokhov
an
officer
of
the
semenov
regiment
a
notorious
gambler
and
duelist
who
was
living
with
anatole
pierre
smiled
looking
about
him
merrily
i
don
t
understand
what
s
it
all
about
wait
a
bit
he
is
not
drunk
yet
a
bottle
here
said
anatole
and
taking
a
glass
from
the
table
he
went
up
to
pierre
first
of
all
you
must
drink
pierre
drank
one
glass
after
another
looking
from
under
his
brows
at
the
tipsy
guests
who
were
again
crowding
round
the
window
and
listening
to
their
chatter
anatole
kept
on
refilling
pierre
s
glass
while
explaining
that
dolokhov
was
betting
with
stevens
an
english
naval
officer
that
he
would
drink
a
bottle
of
rum
sitting
on
the
outer
ledge
of
the
third
floor
window
with
his
legs
hanging
out
go
on
you
must
drink
it
all
said
anatole
giving
pierre
the
last
glass
or
i
won
t
let
you
go
no
i
won
t
said
pierre
pushing
anatole
aside
and
he
went
up
to
the
window
dolokhov
was
holding
the
englishman
s
hand
and
clearly
and
distinctly
repeating
the
terms
of
the
bet
addressing
himself
particularly
to
anatole
and
pierre
dolokhov
was
of
medium
height
with
curly
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
he
was
about
twenty
five
like
all
infantry
officers
he
wore
no
mustache
so
that
his
mouth
the
most
striking
feature
of
his
face
was
clearly
seen
the
lines
of
that
mouth
were
remarkably
finely
curved
the
middle
of
the
upper
lip
formed
a
sharp
wedge
and
closed
firmly
on
the
firm
lower
one
and
something
like
two
distinct
smiles
played
continually
round
the
two
corners
of
the
mouth
this
together
with
the
resolute
insolent
intelligence
of
his
eyes
produced
an
effect
which
made
it
impossible
not
to
notice
his
face
dolokhov
was
a
man
of
small
means
and
no
connections
yet
though
anatole
spent
tens
of
thousands
of
rubles
dolokhov
lived
with
him
and
had
placed
himself
on
such
a
footing
that
all
who
knew
them
including
anatole
himself
respected
him
more
than
they
did
anatole
dolokhov
could
play
all
games
and
nearly
always
won
however
much
he
drank
he
never
lost
his
clearheadedness
both
kuragin
and
dolokhov
were
at
that
time
notorious
among
the
rakes
and
scapegraces
of
petersburg
the
bottle
of
rum
was
brought
the
window
frame
which
prevented
anyone
from
sitting
on
the
outer
sill
was
being
forced
out
by
two
footmen
who
were
evidently
flurried
and
intimidated
by
the
directions
and
shouts
of
the
gentlemen
around
anatole
with
his
swaggering
air
strode
up
to
the
window
he
wanted
to
smash
something
pushing
away
the
footmen
he
tugged
at
the
frame
but
could
not
move
it
he
smashed
a
pane
you
have
a
try
hercules
said
he
turning
to
pierre
pierre
seized
the
crossbeam
tugged
and
wrenched
the
oak
frame
out
with
a
crash
take
it
right
out
or
they
ll
think
i
m
holding
on
said
dolokhov
is
the
englishman
bragging
eh
is
it
all
right
said
anatole
first
rate
said
pierre
looking
at
dolokhov
who
with
a
bottle
of
rum
in
his
hand
was
approaching
the
window
from
which
the
light
of
the
sky
the
dawn
merging
with
the
afterglow
of
sunset
was
visible
dolokhov
the
bottle
of
rum
still
in
his
hand
jumped
onto
the
window
sill
listen
cried
he
standing
there
and
addressing
those
in
the
room
all
were
silent
i
bet
fifty
imperials
he
spoke
french
that
the
englishman
might
understand
him
but
he
did
not
speak
it
very
well
i
bet
fifty
imperials
or
do
you
wish
to
make
it
a
hundred
added
he
addressing
the
englishman
no
fifty
replied
the
latter
all
right
fifty
imperials
that
i
will
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
rum
without
taking
it
from
my
mouth
sitting
outside
the
window
on
this
spot
he
stooped
and
pointed
to
the
sloping
ledge
outside
the
window
and
without
holding
on
to
anything
is
that
right
quite
right
said
the
englishman
anatole
turned
to
the
englishman
and
taking
him
by
one
of
the
buttons
of
his
coat
and
looking
down
at
him
the
englishman
was
short
began
repeating
the
terms
of
the
wager
to
him
in
english
wait
cried
dolokhov
hammering
with
the
bottle
on
the
window
sill
to
attract
attention
wait
a
bit
kuragin
listen
if
anyone
else
does
the
same
i
will
pay
him
a
hundred
imperials
do
you
understand
the
englishman
nodded
but
gave
no
indication
whether
he
intended
to
accept
this
challenge
or
not
anatole
did
not
release
him
and
though
he
kept
nodding
to
show
that
he
understood
anatole
went
on
translating
dolokhov
s
words
into
english
a
thin
young
lad
an
hussar
of
the
life
guards
who
had
been
losing
that
evening
climbed
on
the
window
sill
leaned
over
and
looked
down
oh
oh
oh
he
muttered
looking
down
from
the
window
at
the
stones
of
the
pavement
shut
up
cried
dolokhov
pushing
him
away
from
the
window
the
lad
jumped
awkwardly
back
into
the
room
tripping
over
his
spurs
placing
the
bottle
on
the
window
sill
where
he
could
reach
it
easily
dolokhov
climbed
carefully
and
slowly
through
the
window
and
lowered
his
legs
pressing
against
both
sides
of
the
window
he
adjusted
himself
on
his
seat
lowered
his
hands
moved
a
little
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
and
took
up
the
bottle
anatole
brought
two
candles
and
placed
them
on
the
window
sill
though
it
was
already
quite
light
dolokhov
s
back
in
his
white
shirt
and
his
curly
head
were
lit
up
from
both
sides
everyone
crowded
to
the
window
the
englishman
in
front
pierre
stood
smiling
but
silent
one
man
older
than
the
others
present
suddenly
pushed
forward
with
a
scared
and
angry
look
and
wanted
to
seize
hold
of
dolokhov
s
shirt
i
say
this
is
folly
he
ll
be
killed
said
this
more
sensible
man
anatole
stopped
him
don
t
touch
him
you
ll
startle
him
and
then
he
ll
be
killed
eh
what
then
eh
dolokhov
turned
round
and
again
holding
on
with
both
hands
arranged
himself
on
his
seat
if
anyone
comes
meddling
again
said
he
emitting
the
words
separately
through
his
thin
compressed
lips
i
will
throw
him
down
there
now
then
saying
this
he
again
turned
round
dropped
his
hands
took
the
bottle
and
lifted
it
to
his
lips
threw
back
his
head
and
raised
his
free
hand
to
balance
himself
one
of
the
footmen
who
had
stooped
to
pick
up
some
broken
glass
remained
in
that
position
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
window
and
from
dolokhov
s
back
anatole
stood
erect
with
staring
eyes
the
englishman
looked
on
sideways
pursing
up
his
lips
the
man
who
had
wished
to
stop
the
affair
ran
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
threw
himself
on
a
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
wall
pierre
hid
his
face
from
which
a
faint
smile
forgot
to
fade
though
his
features
now
expressed
horror
and
fear
all
were
still
pierre
took
his
hands
from
his
eyes
dolokhov
still
sat
in
the
same
position
only
his
head
was
thrown
further
back
till
his
curly
hair
touched
his
shirt
collar
and
the
hand
holding
the
bottle
was
lifted
higher
and
higher
and
trembled
with
the
effort
the
bottle
was
emptying
perceptibly
and
rising
still
higher
and
his
head
tilting
yet
further
back
why
is
it
so
long
thought
pierre
it
seemed
to
him
that
more
than
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
suddenly
dolokhov
made
a
backward
movement
with
his
spine
and
his
arm
trembled
nervously
this
was
sufficient
to
cause
his
whole
body
to
slip
as
he
sat
on
the
sloping
ledge
as
he
began
slipping
down
his
head
and
arm
wavered
still
more
with
the
strain
one
hand
moved
as
if
to
clutch
the
window
sill
but
refrained
from
touching
it
pierre
again
covered
his
eyes
and
thought
he
would
never
open
them
again
suddenly
he
was
aware
of
a
stir
all
around
he
looked
up
dolokhov
was
standing
on
the
window
sill
with
a
pale
but
radiant
face
it
s
empty
he
threw
the
bottle
to
the
englishman
who
caught
it
neatly
dolokhov
jumped
down
he
smelt
strongly
of
rum
well
done
fine
fellow
there
s
a
bet
for
you
devil
take
you
came
from
different
sides
the
englishman
took
out
his
purse
and
began
counting
out
the
money
dolokhov
stood
frowning
and
did
not
speak
pierre
jumped
upon
the
window
sill
gentlemen
who
wishes
to
bet
with
me
i
ll
do
the
same
thing
he
suddenly
cried
even

them

bring
me
a
bottle
i
ll

it

a
bottle

said
dolokhov
smiling
what
next

you
why

go
giddy
even
on
a
staircase
exclaimed
several
voices

have
a
bottle
of
rum
shouted
pierre
banging
the
table
with
a
determined
and
drunken
gesture
and
preparing
to
climb
out
of
the
window
they
seized
him
by
his
arms
but
he
was
so
strong
that
everyone
who
touched
him
was
sent
flying
no
you
ll
never
manage
him
that
way
said
anatole
wait
a
bit

pierre

he
caught
the
bear
took
it
in
his
arms
lifted
it
from
the
ground
and
began
dancing
round

came
to

who
constantly
succeeded

off
inviting

these
words
he
repeated
to
everyone
without
exception
or
variation
and
with
the
same
expression
on
his
full
cheerful
clean
shaven
face
the
same
firm
pressure
of
the
hand
and
the
same
quick
repeated
bows
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
a
visitor
off
he
returned
to
one
of
those
who
were
still
in
the
drawing
room
drew
a
chair
toward
him
or
her
and
jauntily
spreading
out
his
legs
and
putting
his
hands
on
his
knees
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
enjoys
life
and
knows
how
to
live
he
swayed
to
and
fro
with
dignity
offered
surmises
about
the
weather
or
touched
on
questions
of
health
sometimes
in
russian
and
sometimes
in
very
bad
but
self
confident
french
then
again
like
a
man
weary
but
unflinching
in
the
fulfillment
of
duty
he
rose
to
see
some
visitors
off
and
stroking
his
scanty
gray
hairs
over
his
bald
patch
also
asked
them
to
dinner
sometimes
on
his
way
back
from
the
anteroom
he
would
pass
through
the
conservatory
and
pantry
into
the
large
marble
dining
hall
where
tables
were
being
set
out
for
eighty
people
and
looking
at
the
footmen
who
were
bringing
in
silver
and
china
moving
tables
and
unfolding
damask
table
linen
he
would
call
dmitri
vasilevich
a
man
of
good
family
and
the
manager
of
all
his
affairs
and
while
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
enormous
table
would
say
well
dmitri
you
ll
see
that
things
are
all
as
they
should
be
that
s
right
the
great
thing
is
the
serving
that
s
it
and
with
a
complacent
sigh
he
would
return
to
the
drawing
room
marya
lvovna
karagina
and
her
daughter
announced
the
countess
gigantic
footman
in
his
bass
voice
entering
the
drawing
room
the
countess
reflected
a
moment
and
took
a
pinch
from
a
gold
snuffbox
with
her
husband
s
portrait
on
it
i
m
quite
worn
out
by
these
callers
however
i
ll
see
her
and
no
more
she
is
so
affected
ask
her
in
she
said
to
the
footman
in
a
sad
voice
as
if
saying
very
well
finish
me
off
a
tall
stout
and
proud
looking
woman
with
a
round
faced
smiling
daughter
entered
the
drawing
room
their
dresses
rustling
dear
countess
what
an
age
she
has
been
laid
up
poor
child
at
the
razumovski
s
ball
and
countess
apraksina
i
was
so
delighted
came
the
sounds
of
animated
feminine
voices
interrupting
one
another
and
mingling
with
the
rustling
of
dresses
and
the
scraping
of
chairs
then
one
of
those
conversations
began
which
last
out
until
at
the
first
pause
the
guests
rise
with
a
rustle
of
dresses
and
say
i
am
so
delighted
mamma
s
health
and
countess
apraksina
and
then
again
rustling
pass
into
the
anteroom
put
on
cloaks
or
mantles
and
drive
away
the
conversation
was
on
the
chief
topic
of
the
day
the
illness
of
the
wealthy
and
celebrated
beau
of
catherine
s
day
count
bezukhov
and
about
his
illegitimate
son
pierre
the
one
who
had
behaved
so
improperly
at
anna
pavlovna
s
reception
i
am
so
sorry
for
the
poor
count
said
the
visitor
he
is
in
such
bad
health
and
now
this
vexation
about
his
son
is
enough
to
kill
him
what
is
that
asked
the
countess
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
the
visitor
alluded
to
though
she
had
already
heard
about
the
cause
of
count
bezukhov
s
distress
some
fifteen
times
that
s
what
comes
of
a
modern
education
exclaimed
the
visitor
it
seems
that
while
he
was
abroad
this
young
man
was
allowed
to
do
as
he
liked
now
in
petersburg
i
hear
he
has
been
doing
such
terrible
things
that
he
has
been
expelled
by
the
police
you
don
t
say
so
replied
the
countess
he
chose
his
friends
badly

prince
vasili
s
son
he
and
a
certain
dolokhov
have
it
is
said
been
up
to
heaven
only
knows
what
and
they
have
had
to
suffer
for
it
dolokhov
has
been
degraded
to
the
ranks
and
bezukhov
s
son
sent
back
to
moscow
anatole
kuragin
s
father
managed
somehow
to
get
his
son
s
affair
hushed
up
but
even
he
was
ordered
out
of
petersburg
but
what
have
they
been
up
to
asked
the
countess
they
are
regular
brigands
especially
dolokhov
replied
the
visitor
he
is
a
son
of
marya
ivanovna
dolokhova
such
a
worthy
woman
but
there
just
fancy
those
three
got
hold
of
a
bear
somewhere
put
it
in
a
carriage
and
set
off
with
it
to
visit
some
actresses
the
police
tried
to
interfere
and
what
did
the
young
men
do
they
tied
a
policeman
and
the
bear
back
to
back
and
put
the
bear
into
the
moyka
canal
and
there
was
the
bear
swimming
about
with
the
policeman
on
his
back
what
a
nice
figure
the
policeman
must
have
cut
my
dear
shouted
the
count
dying
with
laughter
oh
how
dreadful
how
can
you
laugh
at
it
count
yet
the
ladies
themselves
could
not
help
laughing
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
rescue
the
poor
man
continued
the
visitor
and
to
think
it
is
cyril
vladimirovich
bezukhov
s
son
who
amuses
himself
in
this
sensible
manner
and
he
was
said
to
be
so
well
educated
and
clever
this
is
all
that
his
foreign
education
has
done
for
him
i
hope
that
here
in
moscow
no
one
will
receive
him
in
spite
of
his
money
they
wanted
to
introduce
him
to
me
but
i
quite
declined
i
have
my
daughters
to
consider
why
do
you
say
this
young
man
is
so
rich
asked
the
countess
turning
away
from
the
girls
who
at
once
assumed
an
air
of
inattention
his
children
are
all
illegitimate
i
think
pierre
also
is
illegitimate
the
visitor
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
i
should
think
he
has
a
score
of
them
princess
anna
mikhaylovna
intervened
in
the
conversation
evidently
wishing
to
show
her
connections
and
knowledge
of
what
went
on
in
society
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
said
she
significantly
and
also
in
a
half
whisper
everyone
knows
count
cyril
s
reputation
he
has
lost
count
of
his
children
but
this
pierre
was
his
favorite
how
handsome
the
old
man
still
was
only
a
year
ago
remarked
the
countess
i
have
never
seen
a
handsomer
man
he
is
very
much
altered
now
said
anna
mikhaylovna
well
as
i
was
saying
prince
vasili
is
the
next
heir
through
his
wife
but
the
count
is
very
fond
of
pierre
looked
after
his
education
and
wrote
to
the
emperor
about
him
so
that
in
the
case
of
his
death
and
he
is
so
ill
that
he
may
die
at
any
moment
and
dr
lorrain
has
come
from
petersburg
no
one
knows
who
will
inherit
his
immense
fortune
pierre
or
prince
vasili
forty
thousand
serfs
and
millions
of
rubles
i
know
it
all
very
well
for
prince
vasili
told
me
himself
besides
cyril
vladimirovich
is
my
mother
s
second
cousin
he
s
also
my
bory
s
godfather
she
added
as
if
she
attached
no
importance
at
all
to
the
fact
prince
vasili
arrived
in
moscow
yesterday
i
hear
he
has
come
on
some
inspection
business
remarked
the
visitor
yes
but
between
ourselves
said
the
princess
that
is
a
pretext
the
fact
is
he
has
come
to
see
count
cyril
vladimirovich
hearing
how
ill
he
is
but
do
you
know
my
dear
that
was
a
capital
joke
said
the
count
and
seeing
that
the
elder
visitor
was
not
listening
he
turned
to
the
young
ladies
i
can
just
imagine
what
a
funny
figure
that
policeman
cut
and
as
he
waved
his
arms
to
impersonate
the
policeman
his
portly
form
again
shook
with
a
deep
ringing
laugh
the
laugh
of
one
who
always
eats
well
and
in
particular
drinks
well
so
do
come
and
dine
with
us
he
said
chapter
xi
silence
ensued
the
countess
looked
at
her
callers
smiling
affably
but
not
concealing
the
fact
that
she
would
not
be
distressed
if
they
now
rose
and
took
their
leave
the
visitor
s
daughter
was
already
smoothing
down
her
dress
with
an
inquiring
look
at
her
mother
when
suddenly
from
the
next
room
were
heard
the
footsteps
of
boys
and
girls
running
to
the
door
and
the
noise
of
a
chair
falling
over
and
a
girl
of
thirteen
hiding
something
in
the
folds
of
her
short
muslin
frock
darted
in
and
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
was
evident
that
she
had
not
intended
her
flight
to
bring
her
so
far
behind
her
in
the
doorway
appeared
a
student
with
a
crimson
coat
collar
an
officer
of
the
guards
a
girl
of
fifteen
and
a
plump
rosy
faced
boy
in
a
short
jacket
the
count
jumped
up
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
spread
his
arms
wide
and
threw
them
round
the
little
girl
who
had
run
in
ah
here
she
is
he
exclaimed
laughing
my
pet
whose
name
day
it
is
my
dear
pet
ma
chere
there
is
a
time
for
everything
said
the
countess
with
feigned
severity
you
spoil
her
ilya
she
added
turning
to
her
husband
how
do
you
do
my
dear
i
wish
you
many
happy
returns
of
your
name
day
said
the
visitor
what
a
charming
child
she
added
addressing
the
mother
this
black
eyed
wide
mouthed
girl
not
pretty
but
full
of
life
with
childish
bare
shoulders
which
after
her
run
heaved
and
shook
her
bodice
with
black
curls
tossed
backward
thin
bare
arms
little
legs
in
lace
frilled
drawers
and
feet
in
low
slippers
was
just
at
that
charming
age
when
a
girl
is
no
longer
a
child
though
the
child
is
not
yet
a
young
woman
escaping
from
her
father
she
ran
to
hide
her
flushed
face
in
the
lace
of
her
mother
s
mantilla
not
paying
the
least
attention
to
her
severe
remark
and
began
to
laugh
she
laughed
and
in
fragmentary
sentences
tried
to
explain
about
a
doll
which
she
produced
from
the
folds
of
her
frock
do
you
see
my
doll
mimi
you
see
was
all
natasha
managed
to
utter
to
her
everything
seemed
funny
she
leaned
against
her
mother
and
burst
into
such
a
loud
ringing
fit
of
laughter
that
even
the
prim
visitor
could
not
help
joining
in
now
then
go
away
and
take
your
monstrosity
with
you
said
the
mother
pushing
away
her
daughter
with
pretended
sternness
and
turning
to
the
visitor
she
added
she
is
my
youngest
girl
natasha
raising
her
face
for
a
moment
from
her
mother
s
mantilla
glanced
up
at
her
through
tears
of
laughter
and
again
hid
her
face
the
visitor
compelled
to
look
on
at
this
family
scene
thought
it
necessary
to
take
some
part
in
it
tell
me
my
dear
said
she
to
natasha
is
mimi
a
relation
of
yours
a
daughter
i
suppose
natasha
did
not
like
the
visitor
s
tone
of
condescension
to
childish
things
she
did
not
reply
but
looked
at
her
seriously
meanwhile
the
younger
generation
boris
the
officer
anna
mikhaylovna
s
son
nicholas
the
undergraduate
the
count
s
eldest
son
sonya
the
count
s
fifteen
year
old
niece
and
little
petya
his
youngest
boy
had
all
settled
down
in
the
drawing
room
and
were
obviously
trying
to
restrain
within
the
bounds
of
decorum
the
excitement
and
mirth
that
shone
in
all
their
faces
evidently
in
the
back
rooms
from
which
they
had
dashed
out
so
impetuously
the
conversation
had
been
more
amusing
than
the
drawing
room
talk
of
society
scandals
the
weather
and
countess
apraksina
now
and
then
they
glanced
at
one
another
hardly
able
to
suppress
their
laughter
the
two
young
men
the
student
and
the
officer
friends
from
childhood
were
of
the
same
age
and
both
handsome
fellows
though
not
alike
boris
was
tall
and
fair
and
his
calm
and
handsome
face
had
regular
delicate
features
nicholas
was
short
with
curly
hair
and
an
open
expression
dark
hairs
were
already
showing
on
his
upper
lip
and
his
whole
face
expressed
impetuosity
and
enthusiasm
nicholas
blushed
when
he
entered
the
drawing
room
he
evidently
tried
to
find
something
to
say
but
failed
boris
on
the
contrary
at
once
found
his
footing
and
related
quietly
and
humorously
how
he
had
known
that
doll
mimi
when
she
was
still
quite
a
young
lady
before
her
nose
was
broken
how
she
had
aged
during
the
five
years
he
had
known
her
and
how
her
head
had
cracked
right
across
the
skull
having
said
this
he
glanced
at
natasha
she
turned
away
from
him
and
glanced
at
her
younger
brother
who
was
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter
and
unable
to
control
herself
any
longer
she
jumped
up
and
rushed
from
the
room
as
fast
as
her
nimble
little
feet
would
carry
her
boris
did
not
laugh
you
were
meaning
to
go
out
weren
t
you
mamma
do
you
want
the
carriage
he
asked
his
mother
with
a
smile
yes
yes
go
and
tell
them
to
get
it
ready
she
answered
returning
his
smile
boris
quietly
left
the
room
and
went
in
search
of
natasha
the
plump
boy
ran
after
them
angrily
as
if
vexed
that
their
program
had
been
disturbed
chapter
xii
the
only
young
people
remaining
in
the
drawing
room
not
counting
the
young
lady
visitor
and
the
countess
eldest
daughter
who
was
four
years
older
than
her
sister
and
behaved
already
like
a
grown
up
person
were
nicholas
and
sonya
the
niece
sonya
was
a
slender
little
brunette
with
a
tender
look
in
her
eyes
which
were
veiled
by
long
lashes
thick
black
plaits
coiling
twice
round
her
head
and
a
tawny
tint
in
her
complexion
and
especially
in
the
color
of
her
slender
but
graceful
and
muscular
arms
and
neck
by
the
grace
of
her
movements
by
the
softness
and
flexibility
of
her
small
limbs
and
by
a
certain
coyness
and
reserve
of
manner
she
reminded
one
of
a
pretty
half
grown
kitten
which
promises
to
become
a
beautiful
little
cat
she
evidently
considered
it
proper
to
show
an
interest
in
the
general
conversation
by
smiling
but
in
spite
of
herself
her
eyes
under
their
thick
long
lashes
watched
her
cousin
who
was
going
to
join
the
army
with
such
passionate
girlish
adoration
that
her
smile
could
not
for
a
single
instant
impose
upon
anyone
and
it
was
clear
that
the
kitten
had
settled
down
only
to
spring
up
with
more
energy
and
again
play
with
her
cousin
as
soon
as
they
too
could
like
natasha
and
boris
escape
from
the
drawing
room
ah
yes
my
dear
said
the
count
addressing
the
visitor
and
pointing
to
nicholas
his
friend
boris
has
become
an
officer
and
so
for
friendship
s
sake
he
is
leaving
the
university
and
me
his
old
father
and
entering
the
military
service
my
dear
and
there
was
a
place
and
everything
waiting
for
him
in
the
archives
department
isn
t
that
friendship
remarked
the
count
in
an
inquiring
tone
but
they
say
that
war
has
been
declared
replied
the
visitor
they
ve
been
saying
so
a
long
while
said
the
count
and
they
ll
say
so
again
and
again
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
my
dear
there
s
friendship
for
you
he
repeated
he
s
joining
the
hussars
the
visitor
not
knowing
what
to
say
shook
her
head
it
s
not
at
all
from
friendship
declared
nicholas
flaring
up
and
turning
away
as
if
from
a
shameful
aspersion
it
is
not
from
friendship
at
all
i
simply
feel
that
the
army
is
my
vocation
he
glanced
at
his
cousin
and
the
young
lady
visitor
and
they
were
both
regarding
him
with
a
smile
of
approbation
schubert
the
colonel
of

with

today
he
has
been
here
on
leave
and
is
taking
nicholas
back
with
him
it
can
t
be
helped
said
the
count
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
speaking
playfully
of
a
matter
that
evidently
distressed
him
i
have
already
told
you
papa
said
his
son
that
if
you
don
t
wish
to
let
me
go
i
ll
stay
but
i
know
i
am
no
use
anywhere
except
in
the
army
i
am
not
a
diplomat
or
a
government
clerk
i
don
t
know
how
to
hide
what
i
feel
as
he
spoke
he
kept
glancing
with
the
flirtatiousness
of
a
handsome
youth
at
sonya
and
the
young
lady
visitor
the
little
kitten
feasting
her
eyes
on
him
seemed
ready
at
any
moment
to
start
her
gambols
again
and
display
her
kittenish
nature
all
right
all
right
said
the
old
count
he
always
flares
up
this
buonaparte
has
turned
all
their
heads
they
all
think
of
how
he
rose
from
an
ensign
and
became
emperor
well
well
god
grant
it
he
added
not
noticing
his
visitor
s
sarcastic
smile
the
elders
began
talking
about
bonaparte
julie
karagina
turned
to
young
rostov
what
a
pity
you
weren
t
at
the
arkharovs
on
thursday
it
was
so
dull
without
you
said
she
giving
him
a
tender
smile
the
young
man
flattered
sat
down
nearer
to
her
with
a
coquettish
smile
and
engaged
the
smiling
julie
in
a
confidential
conversation
without
at
all
noticing
that
his
involuntary
smile
had
stabbed
the
heart
of
sonya
who
blushed
and
smiled
unnaturally
in
the
midst
of
his
talk
he
glanced
round
at
her
she
gave
him
a
passionately
angry
glance
and
hardly
able
to
restrain
her
tears
and
maintain
the
artificial
smile
on
her
lips
she
got
up
and
left
the
room
all
nicholas
animation
vanished
he
waited
for
the
first
pause
in
the
conversation
and
then
with
a
distressed
face
left
the
room
to
find
sonya
how
plainly
all
these
young
people
wear
their
hearts
on
their
sleeves
said
anna
mikhaylovna
pointing
to
nicholas
as
he
went
out
cousinage
dangereux
voisinage
she
added
cousinhood
is
a
dangerous
neighborhood
yes
said
the
countess
when
the
brightness
these
young
people
had
brought
into
the
room
had
vanished
and
as
if
answering
a
question
no
one
had
put
but
which
was
always
in
her
mind
and
how
much
suffering
how
much
anxiety
one
has
had
to
go
through
that
we
might
rejoice
in
them
now
and
yet
really
the
anxiety
is
greater
now
than
the
joy
one
is
always
always
anxious
especially
just
at
this
age
so
dangerous
both
for
girls
and
boys
it
all
depends
on
the
bringing
up
remarked
the
visitor
yes
you
re
quite
right
continued
the
countess
till
now
i
have
always
thank
god
been
my
children
s
friend
and
had
their
full
confidence
said
she
repeating
the
mistake
of
so
many
parents
who
imagine
that
their
children
have
no
secrets
from
them
i
know
i
shall
always
be
my
daughters
first
confidante
and
that
if
nicholas
with
his
impulsive
nature
does
get
into
mischief
a
boy
can
t
help
it
he
will
all
the
same
never
be
like
those
petersburg
young
men
yes
they
are
splendid
splendid
youngsters
chimed
in
the
count
who
always
solved
questions
that
seemed
to
him
perplexing
by
deciding
that
everything
was
splendid
just
fancy
wants
to
be
an
hussar
what
s
one
to
do
my
dear
what
a
charming
creature
your
younger
girl

said
the
visitor
a
little
volcano
yes
a
regular
volcano
said
the
count
takes
after
me
and
what
a
voice
she
has
though
she
s
my
daughter
i
tell
the
truth
when
i
say
she
ll
be
a
singer
a
second
salomoni
we
have
engaged
an
italian
to
give
her
lessons
isn
t
she
too
young
i
have
heard
that
it
harms
the
voice
to
train
it
at
that
age
oh
no
not
at
all
too
young
replied
the
count
why
our
mothers
used
to
be
married
at
twelve
or
thirteen
and
she
s
in
love
with
boris
already
just
fancy
said
the
countess
with
a
gentle
smile
looking
at
boris
and
went
on
evidently
concerned
with
a
thought
that
always
occupied
her
now
you
see
if
i
were
to
be
severe
with
her
and
to
forbid
it
goodness
knows
what
they
might
be
up
to
on
the
sly
she
meant
that
they
would
be
kissing
but
as
it
is
i
know
every
word
she
utters
she
will
come
running
to
me
of
her
own
accord
in
the
evening
and
tell
me
everything
perhaps
i
spoil
her
but
really
that
seems
the
best
plan
with
her
elder
sister
i
was
stricter
yes
i
was
brought
up
quite
differently
remarked
the
handsome
elder
daughter
countess
vera
with
a
smile
but
the
smile
did
not
enhance
vera
s
beauty
as
smiles
generally
do
on
the
contrary
it
gave
her
an
unnatural
and
therefore
unpleasant
expression
vera
was
good
looking
not
at
all
stupid
quick
at
learning
was
well
brought
up
and
had
a
pleasant
voice
what
she
said
was
true
and
appropriate
yet
strange
to
say
everyone
the
visitors
and
countess
alike
turned
to
look
at
her
as
if
wondering
why
she
had
said
it
and
they
all
felt
awkward
people
are
always
too
clever
with
their
eldest
children
and
try
to
make
something
exceptional
of
them
said
the
visitor
what
s
the
good
of
denying
it
my
dear
our
dear
countess
was
too
clever
with
vera
said
the
count
well
what
of
that
she
s
turned
out
splendidly
all
the
same
he
added
winking
at
vera
the
guests
got
up
and
took
their
leave
promising
to
return
to
dinner
what
manners
i
thought
they
would
never
go
said
the
countess
when
she
had
seen
her
guests
out
chapter
xiii
when
natasha
ran
out
of
the
drawing
room
she
only
went
as
far
as
the
conservatory
there
she
paused
and
stood
listening
to
the
conversation
in
the
drawing
room
waiting
for
boris
to
come
out
she
was
already
growing
impatient
and
stamped
her
foot
ready
to
cry
at
his
not
coming
at
once
when
she
heard
the
young
man
s
discreet
steps
approaching
neither
quickly
nor
slowly
at
this
natasha
dashed
swiftly
among
the
flower
tubs
and
hid
there
boris
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looked
round
brushed
a
little
dust
from
the
sleeve
of
his
uniform
and
going
up
to
a
mirror
examined
his
handsome
face
natasha
very
still
peered
out
from
her
ambush
waiting
to
see
what
he
would
do
he
stood
a
little
while
before
the
glass
smiled
and
walked
toward
the
other
door
natasha
was
about
to
call
him
but
changed
her
mind
let
him
look
for
me
thought
she
hardly
had
boris
gone
than
sonya
flushed
in
tears
and
muttering
angrily
came
in
at
the
other
door
natasha
checked
her
first
impulse
to
run
out
to
her
and
remained
in
her
hiding
place
watching
as
under
an
invisible
cap
to
see
what
went
on
in
the
world
she
was
experiencing
a
new
and
peculiar
pleasure
sonya
muttering
to
herself
kept
looking
round
toward
the
drawing
room
door
it
opened
and
nicholas
came
in
sonya
what
is
the
matter
with
you
how
can
you
said
he
running
up
to
her
it
s
nothing
nothing
leave
me
alone
sobbed
sonya
ah
i
know
what
it
is
well
if
you
do
so
much
the
better
and
you
can
go
back
to
her
so
o
onya
look
here
how
can
you
torture
me
and
yourself
like
that
for
a
mere
fancy
said
nicholas
taking
her
hand
sonya
did
not
pull
it
away
and
left
off
crying
natasha
not
stirring
and
scarcely
breathing
watched
from
her
ambush
with
sparkling
eyes
what
will
happen
now
thought
she
sonya
what
is
anyone
in
the
world
to
me
you
alone
are
everything
said
nicholas
and
i
will
prove
it
to
you
i
don
t
like
you
to
talk
like
that
well
then
i
won
t
only
forgive
me
sonya
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
oh
how
nice
thought
natasha
and
when
sonya
and
nicholas
had
gone
out
of
the
conservatory
she
followed
and
called
boris
to
her
boris
come
here
said
she
with
a
sly
and
significant
look
i
have
something
to
tell
you
here
here
and
she
led
him
into
the
conservatory
to
the
place
among
the
tubs
where
she
had
been
hiding
boris
followed
her
smiling
what
is
the
something
asked
he
she
grew
confused
glanced
round
and
seeing
the
doll
she
had
thrown
down
on
one
of
the
tubs
picked
it
up
kiss
the
doll
said
she
boris
looked
attentively
and
kindly
at
her
eager
face
but
did
not
reply
don
t
you
want
to
well
then
come
here
said
she
and
went
further
in
among
the
plants
and
threw
down
the
doll
closer
closer
she
whispered
she
caught
the
young
officer
by
his
cuffs
and
a
look
of
solemnity
and
fear
appeared
on
her
flushed
face
and
me
would
you
like
to
kiss
me
she
whispered
almost
inaudibly
glancing
up
at
him
from
under
her
brows
smiling
and
almost
crying
from
excitement
boris
blushed
how
funny
you
are
he
said
bending
down
to
her
and
blushing
still
more
but
he
waited
and
did
nothing
suddenly
she
jumped
up
onto
a
tub
to
be
higher
than
he
embraced
him
so
that
both
her
slender
bare
arms
clasped
him
above
his
neck
and
tossing
back
her
hair
kissed
him
full
on
the
lips
then
she
slipped
down
among
the
flowerpots
on
the
other
side
of
the
tubs
and
stood
hanging
her
head
natasha
he
said
you
know
that
i
love
you
but
you
are
in
love
with
me
natasha
broke
in
yes
i
am
but
please
don
t
let
us
do
like
that
in
another
four
years
then
i
will
ask
for
your
hand
natasha
considered
thirteen
fourteen
fifteen
sixteen
she
counted
on
her
slender
little
fingers
all
right
then
it
s
settled
a
smile
of
joy
and
satisfaction
lit
up
her
eager
face
settled
replied
boris
forever
said
the
little
girl
till
death
itself
she
took
his
arm
and
with
a
happy
face
went
with
him
into
the
adjoining
sitting
room
chapter
xiv
after
receiving
her
visitors
the
countess
was
so
tired
that
she
gave
orders
to
admit
no
more
but
the
porter
was
told
to
be
sure
to
invite
to
dinner
all
who
came
to
congratulate
the
countess
wished
to
have
a
tete
a
tete
talk
with
the
friend
of
her
childhood
princess
anna
mikhaylovna
whom
she
had
not
seen
properly
since
she
returned
from
petersburg
anna
mikhaylovna
with
her
tear
worn
but
pleasant
face
drew
her
chair
nearer
to
that
of
the
countess
with
you
i
will
be
quite
frank
said
anna
mikhaylovna
there
are
not
many
left
of
us
old
friends
that
s
why
i
so
value
your
friendship
anna
mikhaylovna
looked
at
vera
and
paused
the
countess
pressed
her
friend
s
hand
vera
she
said
to
her
eldest
daughter
who
was
evidently
not
a
favorite
how
is
it
you
have
so
little
tact
don
t
you
see
you
are
not
wanted
here
go
to
the
other
girls
or
the
handsome
vera
smiled
contemptuously
but
did
not
seem
at
all
hurt
if
you
had
told
me
sooner
mamma
i
would
have
gone
she
replied
as
she
rose
to
go
to
her
own
room
but
as
she
passed
the
sitting
room
she
noticed
two
couples
sitting
one
pair
at
each
window
she
stopped
and
smiled
scornfully
sonya
was
sitting
close
to
nicholas
who
was
copying
out
some
verses
for
her
the
first
he
had
ever
written
boris
and
natasha
were
at
the
other
window
and
ceased
talking
when
vera
entered
sonya
and
natasha
looked
at
vera
with
guilty
happy
faces
it
was
pleasant
and
touching
to
see
these
little
girls
in
love
but
apparently
the
sight
of
them
roused
no
pleasant
feeling
in
vera
how
often
have
i
asked
you
not
to
take
my
things
she
said
you
have
a
room
of
your
own
and
she
took
the
inkstand
from
nicholas
in
a
minute
in
a
minute
he
said
dipping
his
pen
you
always
manage
to
do
things
at
the
wrong
time
continued
vera
you
came
rushing
into
the
drawing
room
so
that
everyone
felt
ashamed
of
you
though
what
she
said
was
quite
just
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
no
one
replied
and
the
four
simply
looked
at
one
another
she
lingered
in
the
room
with
the
inkstand
in
her
hand
and
at
your
age
what
secrets
can
there
be
between
natasha
and
boris
or
between
you
two
it
s
all
nonsense
now
vera
what
does
it
matter
to
you
said
natasha
in
defense
speaking
very
gently
she
seemed
that
day
to
be
more
than
ever
kind
and
affectionate
to
everyone
very
silly
said
vera
i
am
ashamed
of
you
secrets
indeed
all
have
secrets
of
their
own
answered
natasha
getting
warmer
we
don
t
interfere
with
you
and
berg
i
should
think
not
said
vera
because
there
can
never
be
anything
wrong
in
my
behavior
but
i
ll
just
tell
mamma
how
you
are
behaving
with
boris
natalya
ilynichna
behaves
very
well
to
me
remarked
boris
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
don
t
boris
you
are
such
a
diplomat
that
it
is
really
tiresome
said
natasha
in
a
mortified
voice
that
trembled
slightly
she
used
the
word
diplomat
which
was
just
then
much
in
vogue
among
the
children
in
the
special
sense
they
attached
to
it
why
does
she
bother
me
and
she
added
turning
to
vera
you
ll
never
understand
it
because
you
ve
never
loved
anyone
you
have
no
heart
you
are
a
madame
de
genlis
and
nothing
more
this
nickname
bestowed
on
vera
by
nicholas
was
considered
very
stinging
and
your
greatest
pleasure
is
to
be
unpleasant
to
people
go
and
flirt
with
berg
as
much
as
you
please
she
finished
quickly
i
shall
at
any
rate
not
run
after
a
young
man
before
visitors
well
now
you
ve
done
what
you
wanted
put
in
nicholas
said
unpleasant
things
to
everyone
and
upset
them
let
s
go
to
the
nursery
all
four
like
a
flock
of
scared
birds
got
up
and
left
the
room
the
unpleasant
things
were
said
to
me
remarked
vera
i
said
none
to
anyone
madame
de
genlis
madame
de
genlis
shouted
laughing
voices
through
the
door
the
handsome
vera
who
produced
such
an
irritating
and
unpleasant
effect
on
everyone
smiled
and
evidently
unmoved
by
what
had
been
said
to
her
went
to
the
looking
glass
and
arranged
her
hair
and
scarf
looking
at
her
own
handsome
face
she
seemed
to
become
still
colder
and
calmer
in
the
drawing
room
the
conversation
was
still
going
on
ah
my
dear
said
the
countess
my
life
is
not
all
roses
either
don
t
i
know
that
at
the
rate
we
are
living
our
means
won
t
last
long
it
s
all
the
club
and
his
easygoing
nature
even
in
the
country
do
we
get
any
rest
theatricals
hunting
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
but
don
t
let
s
talk
about
me
tell
me
how
you
managed
everything
i
often
wonder
at
you
annette
how
at
your
age
you
can
rush
off
alone
in
a
carriage
to
moscow
to
petersburg
to
those
ministers
and
great
people
and
know
how
to
deal
with
them
all
it
s
quite
astonishing
how
did
you
get
things
settled
i
couldn
t
possibly
do
it
ah
my
love
answered
anna
mikhaylovna
god
grant
you
never
know
what
it
is
to
be
left
a
widow
without
means
and
with
a
son
you
love
to
distraction
one
learns
many
things
then
she
added
with
a
certain
pride
that
lawsuit
taught
me
much
when
i
want
to
see
one
of
those
big
people
i
write
a
note
princess
so
and
so
desires
an
interview
with
so
and
so
and
then
i
take
a
cab
and
go
myself
two
three
or
four
times
till
i
get
what
i
want
i
don
t
mind
what
they
think
of
me
well
and
to
whom
did
you
apply
about
bory
asked
the
countess
you
see
yours
is
already
an
officer
in
the
guards
while
my
nicholas
is
going
as
a
cadet
there
s
no
one
to
interest
himself
for
him
to
whom
did
you
apply
to
prince
vasili
he
was
so
kind
he
at
once
agreed
to
everything
and
put
the
matter
before
the
emperor
said
princess
anna
mikhaylovna
enthusiastically
quite
forgetting
all
the
humiliation
she
had
endured
to
gain
her
end
has
prince
vasili
aged
much
asked
the
countess
i
have
not
seen
him
since
we
acted
together
at
the
rumyantsovs
theatricals
i
expect
he
has
forgotten
me
he
paid
me
attentions
in
those
days
said
the
countess
with
a
smile
he
is
just
the
same
as
ever
replied
anna
mikhaylovna
overflowing
with
amiability
his
position
has
not
turned
his
head
at
all
he
said
to
me
i
am
sorry
i
can
do
so
little
for
you
dear
princess
i
am
at
your
command
yes
he
is
a
fine
fellow
and
a
very
kind
relation
but
nataly
you
know
my
love
for
my
son
i
would
do
anything
for
his
happiness
and
my
affairs
are
in
such
a
bad
way
that
my
position
is
now
a
terrible
one
continued
anna
mikhaylovna
sadly
dropping
her
voice
my
wretched
lawsuit
takes
all
i
have
and
makes
no
progress
would
you
believe
it
i
have
literally
not
a
penny
and
don
t
know
how
to
equip
boris
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
began
to
cry
i
need
five
hundred
rubles
and
have
only
one
twenty
five
ruble
note
i
am
in
such
a
state
my
only
hope
now
is
in
count
cyril
vladimirovich
bezukhov
if
he
will
not
assist
his
godson
you
know
he
is
bory
s
godfather
and
allow
him
something
for
his
maintenance
all
my
trouble
will
have
been
thrown
away
i
shall
not
be
able
to
equip
him
the
countess
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
pondered
in
silence
i
often
think
though
perhaps
it
s
a
sin
said
the
princess
that
here
lives
count
cyril
vladimirovich
bezukhov
so
rich
all
alone
that
tremendous
fortune
and
what
is
his
life
worth
it
s
a
burden
to
him
and
bory
s
life
is
only
just
beginning
surely
he
will
leave
something
to
boris
said
the
countess
heaven
only
knows
my
dear
these
rich
grandees
are
so
selfish
still
i
will
take
boris
and
go
to
see
him
at
once
and
i
shall
speak
to
him
straight
out
let
people
think
what
they
will
of
me
it
s
really
all
the
same
to
me
when
my
son
s
fate
is
at
stake
the
princess
rose
it
s
now
two
o
clock
and
you
dine
at
four
there
will
just
be
time
and
like
a
practical
petersburg
lady
who
knows
how
to
make
the
most
of
time
anna
mikhaylovna
sent
someone
to
call
her
son
and
went
into
the
anteroom
with
him
good
by
my
dear
said
she
to
the
countess
who
saw
her
to
the
door
and
added
in
a
whisper
so
that
her
son
should
not
hear
wish
me
good
luck
are
you
going
to
count
cyril
vladimirovich
my
dear
said
the
count
coming
out
from
the
dining
hall
into
the
anteroom
and
he
added
if
he
is
better
ask
pierre
to
dine
with
us
he
has
been
to
the
house
you
know
and
danced
with
the
children
be
sure
to
invite
him
my
dear
we
will
see
how
taras
distinguishes
himself
today
he
says
count
orlov
never
gave
such
a
dinner
as
ours
will
be
chapter
xv
my
dear
boris
said
princess
anna
mikhaylovna
to
her
son
as
countess
rostova
s
carriage
in
which
they
were
seated
drove
over
the
straw
covered
street
and
turned
into
the
wide
courtyard
of
count
cyril
vladimirovich
bezukhov
s
house
my
dear
boris
said
the
mother
drawing
her
hand
from
beneath
her
old
mantle
and
laying
it
timidly
and
tenderly
on
her
son
s
arm
be
affectionate
and
attentive
to
him
count
cyril
vladimirovich
is
your
godfather
after
all
and
your
future
depends
on
him
remember
that
my
dear
and
be
nice
to
him
as
you
so
well
know
how
to
be
if
only
i
knew
that
anything
besides
humiliation
would
come
of
it
answered
her
son
coldly
but
i
have
promised
and
will
do
it
for
your
sake
although
the
hall
porter
saw
someone
s
carriage
standing
at
the
entrance
after
scrutinizing
the
mother
and
son
who
without
asking
to
be
announced
had
passed
straight
through
the
glass
porch
between
the
rows
of
statues
in
niches
and
looking
significantly
at
the
lady
s
old
cloak
he
asked
whether
they
wanted
the
count
or
the
princesses
and
hearing
that
they
wished
to
see
the
count
said
his
excellency
was
worse
today
and
that
his
excellency
was
not
receiving
anyone
we
may
as
well
go
back
said
the
son
in
french
my
dear
exclaimed
his
mother
imploringly
again
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
as
if
that
touch
might
soothe
or
rouse
him
boris
said
no
more
but
looked
inquiringly
at
his
mother
without
taking
off
his
cloak
my
friend
said
anna
mikhaylovna
in
gentle
tones
addressing
the
hall
porter
i
know
count
cyril
vladimirovich
is
very
ill
that
s
why
i
have
come
i
am
a
relation
i
shall
not
disturb
him
my
friend
i
only
need
see
prince
vasili
sergeevich
he
is
staying
here
is
he
not
please
announce
me
the
hall
porter
sullenly
pulled
a
bell
that
rang
upstairs
and
turned
away
princess
drubetskaya
to
see
prince
vasili
sergeevich
he
called
to
a
footman
dressed
in
knee
breeches
shoes
and
a
swallow
tail
coat
who
ran
downstairs
and
looked
over
from
the
halfway
landing
the
mother
smoothed
the
folds
of
her
dyed
silk
dress
before
a
large
venetian
mirror
in
the
wall
and
in
her
trodden
down
shoes
briskly
ascended
the
carpeted
stairs
my
dear
she
said
to
her
son
once
more
stimulating
him
by
a
touch
you
promised
me
the
son
lowering
his
eyes
followed
her
quietly
they
entered
the
large
hall
from
which
one
of
the
doors
led
to
the
apartments
assigned
to
prince
vasili
just
as
the
mother
and
son
having
reached
the
middle
of
the
hall
were
about
to
ask
their
way
of
an
elderly
footman
who
had
sprung
up
as
they
entered
the
bronze
handle
of
one
of
the
doors
turned
and
prince
vasili
came
out
wearing
a
velvet
coat
with
a
single
star
on
his
breast
as
was
his
custom
when
at
home
taking
leave
of
a
good
looking
dark
haired
man
this
was
the
celebrated
petersburg
doctor
lorrain
then
it
is
certain
said
the
prince
prince
humanum
est
errare
but
replied
the
doctor
swallowing
his
r
s
and
pronouncing
the
latin
words
with
a
french
accent
to
err
is
human
very
well
very
well
seeing
anna
mikhaylovna
and
her
son
prince
vasili
dismissed
the
doctor
with
a
bow
and
approached
them
silently
and
with
a
look
of
inquiry
the
son
noticed
that
an
expression
of
profound
sorrow
suddenly
clouded
his
mother
s
face
and
he
smiled
slightly
ah
prince
in
what
sad
circumstances
we
meet
again
and
how
is
our
dear
invalid
said
she
as
though
unaware
of
the
cold
offensive
look
fixed
on
her
prince
vasili
stared
at
her
and
at
boris
questioningly
and
perplexed
boris
bowed
politely
prince
vasili
without
acknowledging
the
bow
turned
to
anna
mikhaylovna
answering
her
query
by
a
movement
of
the
head
and
lips
indicating
very
little
hope
for
the
patient
is
it
possible
exclaimed
anna
mikhaylovna
oh
how
awful
it
is
terrible
to
think
this
is
my
son
she
added
indicating
boris
he
wanted
to
thank
you
himself
boris
bowed
again
politely
believe
me
prince
a
mother
s
heart
will
never
forget
what
you
have
done
for
us
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
do
you
a
service
my
dear
anna
mikhaylovna
said
prince
vasili
arranging
his
lace
frill
and
in
tone
and
manner
here
in
moscow
to
anna
mikhaylovna
whom
he
had
placed
under
an
obligation
assuming
an
air
of
much
greater
importance
than
he
had
done
in
petersburg
at
anna
scherer
s
reception
try
to
serve
well
and
show
yourself
worthy
added
he
addressing
boris
with
severity
i
am
glad
are
you
here
on
leave
he
went
on
in
his
usual
tone
of
indifference
i
am
awaiting
orders
to
join
my
new
regiment
your
excellency
replied
boris
betraying
neither
annoyance
at
the
prince
s
brusque
manner
nor
a
desire
to
enter
into
conversation
but
speaking
so
quietly
and
respectfully
that
the
prince
gave
him
a
searching
glance
are
you
living
with
your
mother
i
am
living
at
countess
rostova
s
replied
boris
again
adding
your
excellency
that
is
with
ilya
rostov
who
married
nataly
shinshina
said
anna
mikhaylovna
i
know
i
know
answered
prince
vasili
in
his
monotonous
voice
i
never
could
understand
how
nataly
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
that
unlicked
bear
a
perfectly
absurd
and
stupid
fellow
and
a
gambler
too
i
am
told
but
a
very
kind
man
prince
said
anna
mikhaylovna
with
a
pathetic
smile
as
though
she
too
knew
that
count
rostov
deserved
this
censure
but
asked
him
not
to
be
too
hard
on
the
poor
old
man
what
do
the
doctors
say
asked
the
princess
after
a
pause
her
worn
face
again
expressing
deep
sorrow
they
give
little
hope
replied
the
prince
and
i
should
so
like
to
thank
uncle
once
for
all
his
kindness
to
me
and
boris
he
is
his
godson
she
added
her
tone
suggesting
that
this
fact
ought
to
give
prince
vasili
much
satisfaction
prince
vasili
became
thoughtful
and
frowned
anna
mikhaylovna
saw
that
he
was
afraid
of
finding
in
her
a
rival
for
count
bezukhov
s
fortune
and
hastened
to
reassure
him
if
it
were
not
for
my
sincere
affection
and
devotion
to
uncle
said
she
uttering
the
word
with
peculiar
assurance
and
unconcern
i
know
his
character
noble
upright
but
you
see
he
has
no
one
with
him
except
the
young
princesses
they
are
still
young
she
bent
her
head
and
continued
in
a
whisper
has
he
performed
his
final
duty
prince
how
priceless
are
those
last
moments
it
can
make
things
no
worse
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
prepare
him
if
he
is
so
ill
we
women
prince
and
she
smiled
tenderly
always
know
how
to
say
these
things
i
absolutely
must
see
him
however
painful
it
may
be
for
me
i
am
used
to
suffering
evidently
the
prince
understood
her
and
also
understood
as
he
had
done
at
anna
pavlovna
s
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
rid
of
anna
mikhaylovna
would
not
such
a
meeting
be
too
trying
for
him
dear
anna
mikhaylovna
said
he
let
us
wait
until
evening
the
doctors
are
expecting
a
crisis
but
one
cannot
delay
prince
at
such
a
moment
consider
that
the
welfare
of
his
soul
is
at
stake
ah
it
is
awful
the
duties
of
a
christian
a
door
of
one
of
the
inner
rooms
opened
and
one
of
the
princesses
the
count
s
niece
entered
with
a
cold
stern
face
the
length
of
her
body
was
strikingly
out
of
proportion
to
her
short
legs
prince
vasili
turned
to
her
well
how
is
he
still
the
same
but
what
can
you
expect
this
noise
said
the
princess
looking
at
anna
mikhaylovna
as
at
a
stranger
ah
my
dear
i
hardly
knew
you
said
anna
mikhaylovna
with
a
happy
smile
ambling
lightly
up
to
the
count
s
niece
i
have
come
and
am
at
your
service
to
help
you
nurse
my
uncle
i
imagine
what
you
have
gone
through
and
she
sympathetically
turned
up
her
eyes
the
princess
gave
no
reply
and
did
not
even
smile
but
left
the
room
as
anna
mikhaylovna
took
off
her
gloves
and
occupying
the
position
she
had
conquered
settled
down
in
an
armchair
inviting
prince
vasili
to
take
a
seat
beside
her
boris
she
said
to
her
son
with
a
smile
i
shall
go
in
to
see
the
count
my
uncle
but
you
my
dear
had
better
go
to
pierre
meanwhile
and
don
t
forget
to
give
him
the
rostovs
invitation
they
ask
him
to
dinner
i
suppose
he
won
t
go
she
continued
turning
to
the
prince
on
the
contrary
replied
the
prince
who
had
plainly
become
depressed
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
if
you
relieve
me
of
that
young
man
here
he
is
and
the
count
has
not
once
asked
for
him
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
footman
conducted
boris
down
one
flight
of
stairs
and
up
another
to
pierre
s
rooms
chapter
xvi
pierre
after
all
had
not
managed
to
choose
a
career
for
himself
in
petersburg
and
had
been
expelled
from
there
for
riotous
conduct
and
sent
to
moscow
the
story
told
about
him
at
count
rostov
s
was
true
pierre
had
taken
part
in
tying
a
policeman
to
a
bear
he
had
now
been
for
some
days
in
moscow
and
was
staying
as
usual
at
his
father
s
house
though
he
expected
that
the
story
of
his
escapade
would
be
already
known
in
moscow
and
that
the
ladies
about
his
father
who
were
never
favorably
disposed
toward
him
would
have
used
it
to
turn
the
count
against
him
he
nevertheless
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
went
to
his
father
s
part
of
the
house
entering
the
drawing
room
where
the
princesses
spent
most
of
their
time
he
greeted
the
ladies
two
of
whom
were
sitting
at
embroidery
frames
while
a
third
read
aloud
it
was
the
eldest
who
was
reading
the
one
who
had
met
anna
mikhaylovna
the
two
younger
ones
were
embroidering
both
were
rosy
and
pretty
and
they
differed
only
in
that
one
had
a
little
mole
on
her
lip
which
made
her
much
prettier
pierre
was
received
as
if
he
were
a
corpse
or
a
leper
the
eldest
princess
paused
in
her
reading
and
silently
stared
at
him
with
frightened
eyes
the
second
assumed
precisely
the
same
expression
while
the
youngest
the
one
with
the
mole
who
was
of
a
cheerful
and
lively
disposition
bent
over
her
frame
to
hide
a
smile
probably
evoked
by
the
amusing
scene
she
foresaw
she
drew
her
wool
down
through
the
canvas
and
scarcely
able
to
refrain
from
laughing
stooped
as
if
trying
to
make
out
the
pattern
how
do
you
do
cousin
said
pierre
you
don
t
recognize
me
i
recognize
you
only
too
well
too
well
how
is
the
count
can
i
see
him
asked
pierre
awkwardly
as
usual
but
unabashed
the
count
is
suffering
physically
and
mentally
and
apparently
you
have
done
your
best
to
increase
his
mental
sufferings
can
i
see
the
count
pierre
again
asked
hm
if
you
wish
to
kill
him
to
kill
him
outright
you
can
see
him
olga
go
and
see
whether
uncle
s
beef
tea
is
ready
it
is
almost
time
she
added
giving
pierre
to
understand
that
they
were
busy
and
busy
making
his
father
comfortable
while
evidently
he
pierre
was
only
busy
causing
him
annoyance
olga
went
out
pierre
stood
looking
at
the
sisters
then
he
bowed
and
said
then
i
will
go
to
my
rooms
you
will
let
me
know
when
i
can
see
him
and
he
left
the
room
followed
by
the
low
but
ringing
laughter
of
the
sister
with
the
mole
next
day
prince
vasili
had
arrived
and
settled
in
the
count
s
house
he
sent
for
pierre
and
said
to
him
my
dear
fellow
if
you
are
going
to
behave
here
as
you
did
in
petersburg
you
will
end
very
badly
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
the
count
is
very
very
ill
and
you
must
not
see
him
at
all
since
then
pierre
had
not
been
disturbed
and
had
spent
the
whole
time
in
his
rooms
upstairs
when
boris
appeared
at
his
door
pierre
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
room
stopping
occasionally
at
a
corner
to
make
menacing
gestures
at
the
wall
as
if
running
a
sword
through
an
invisible
foe
and
glaring
savagely
over
his
spectacles
and
then
again
resuming
his
walk
muttering
indistinct
words
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
gesticulating
england
is
done
for
said
he
scowling
and
pointing
his
finger
at
someone
unseen
mr
pitt
as
a
traitor
to
the
nation
and
to
the
rights
of
man
is
sentenced
to
but
before
pierre
who
at
that
moment
imagined
himself
to
be
napoleon
in
person
and
to
have
just
effected
the
dangerous
crossing
of
the
straits
of
dover
and
captured
london
could
pronounce
pitt
s
sentence
he
saw
a
well
built
and
handsome
young
officer
entering
his
room
pierre
paused
he
had
left
moscow
when
boris
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
and
had
quite
forgotten
him
but
in
his
usual
impulsive
and
hearty
way
he
took
boris
by
the
hand
with
a
friendly
smile
do
you
remember
me
asked
boris
quietly
with
a
pleasant
smile
i
have
come
with
my
mother
to
see
the
count
but
it
seems
he
is
not
well
yes
it
seems
he
is
ill
people
are
always
disturbing
him
answered
pierre
trying
to
remember
who
this
young
man
was
boris
felt
that
pierre
did
not
recognize
him
but
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
introduce
himself
and
without
experiencing
the
least
embarrassment
looked
pierre
straight
in
the
face
count
rostov
asks
you
to
come
to
dinner
today
said
he
after
a
considerable
pause
which
made
pierre
feel
uncomfortable
ah
count
rostov
exclaimed
pierre
joyfully
then
you
are
his
son
ilya
only
fancy
i
didn
t
know
you
at
first
do
you
remember
how
we
went
to
the
sparrow
hills
with
madame
jacquot
it
s
such
an
age
you
are
mistaken
said
boris
deliberately
with
a
bold
and
slightly
sarcastic
smile
i
am
boris
son
of
princess
anna
mikhaylovna
drubetskaya
rostov
the
father
is
ilya
and
his
son
is
nicholas
i
never
knew
any
madame
jacquot
pierre
shook
his
head
and
arms
as
if
attacked
by
mosquitoes
or
bees
oh
dear
what
am
i
thinking
about
i
ve
mixed
everything
up
one
has
so
many
relatives
in
moscow
so
you
are
boris
of
course
well
now
we
know
where
we
are
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
boulogne
expedition
the
english
will
come
off
badly
you
know
if
napoleon
gets
across
the
channel
i
think
the
expedition
is
quite
feasible
if
only
villeneuve
doesn
t
make
a
mess
of
things
boris
knew
nothing
about
the
boulogne
expedition
he
did
not
read
the
papers
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
villeneuve
s
name
we
here
in
moscow
are
more
occupied
with
dinner
parties
and
scandal
than
with
politics
said
he
in
his
quiet
ironical
tone
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
have
not
thought
about
it
moscow
is
chiefly
busy
with
gossip
he
continued
just
now
they
are
talking
about
you
and
your
father
pierre
smiled
in
his
good
natured
way
as
if
afraid
for
his
companion
s
sake
that
the
latter
might
say
something
he
would
afterwards
regret
but
boris
spoke
distinctly
clearly
and
dryly
looking
straight
into
pierre
s
eyes
moscow
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
gossip
boris
went
on
everybody
is
wondering
to
whom
the
count
will
leave
his
fortune
though
he
may
perhaps
outlive
us
all
as
i
sincerely
hope
he
will
yes
it
is
all
very
horrid
interrupted
pierre
very
horrid
pierre
was
still
afraid
that
this
officer
might
inadvertently
say
something
disconcerting
to
himself
and
it
must
seem
to
you
said
boris
flushing
slightly
but
not
changing
his
tone
or
attitude
it
must
seem
to
you
that
everyone
is
trying
to
get
something
out
of
the
rich
man
so
it
does
thought
pierre
but
i
just
wish
to
say
to
avoid
misunderstandings
that
you
are
quite
mistaken
if
you
reckon
me
or
my
mother
among
such
people
we
are
very
poor
but
for
my
own
part
at
any
rate
for
the
very
reason
that
your
father
is
rich
i
don
t
regard
myself
as
a
relation
of
his
and
neither
i
nor
my
mother
would
ever
ask
or
take
anything
from
him
for
a
long
time
pierre
could
not
understand
but
when
he
did
he
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
seized
boris
under
the
elbow
in
his
quick
clumsy
way
and
blushing
far
more
than
boris
began
to
speak
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
shame
and
vexation
well
this
is
strange
do
you
suppose
i
who
could
think
i
know
very
well
but
boris
again
interrupted
him
i
am
glad
i
have
spoken
out
fully
perhaps
you
did
not
like
it
you
must
excuse
me
said
he
putting
pierre
at
ease
instead
of
being
put
at
ease
by
him
but
i
hope
i
have
not
offended
you
i
always
make
it
a
rule
to
speak
out
well
what
answer
am
i
to
take
will
you
come
to
dinner
at
the
rostovs
and
boris
having
apparently
relieved
himself
of
an
onerous
duty
and
extricated
himself
from
an
awkward
situation
and
placed
another
in
it
became
quite
pleasant
again
no
but
i
say
said
pierre
calming
down
you
are
a
wonderful
fellow
what
you
have
just
said
is
good
very
good
of
course
you
don
t
know
me
we
have
not
met
for
such
a
long
time
not
since
we
were
children
you
might
think
that
i
i
understand
quite
understand
i
could
not
have
done
it
myself
i
should
not
have
had
the
courage
but
it
s
splendid
i
am
very
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
it
s
queer
he
added
after
a
pause
that
you
should
have
suspected
me
he
began
to
laugh
well
what
of
it
i
hope
we
ll
get
better
acquainted
and
he
pressed
boris
hand
do
you
know
i
have
not
once
been
in
to
see
the
count
he
has
not
sent
for
me
i
am
sorry
for
him
as
a
man
but
what
can
one
do
and
so
you
think
napoleon
will
manage
to
get
an
army
across
asked
boris
with
a
smile
pierre
saw
that
boris
wished
to
change
the
subject
and
being
of
the
same
mind
he
began
explaining
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
boulogne
expedition
a
footman
came
in
to
summon
boris
the
princess
was
going
pierre
in
order
to
make
boris
better
acquaintance
promised
to
come
to
dinner
and
warmly
pressing
his
hand
looked
affectionately
over
his
spectacles
into
boris
eyes
after
he
had
gone
pierre
continued
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
long
time
no
longer
piercing
an
imaginary
foe
with
his
imaginary
sword
but
smiling
at
the
remembrance
of
that
pleasant
intelligent
and
resolute
young
man
as
often
happens
in
early
youth
especially
to
one
who
leads
a
lonely
life
he
felt
an
unaccountable
tenderness
for
this
young
man
and
made
up
his
mind
that
they
would
be
friends
prince
vasili
saw
the
princess
off
she
held
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
her
face
was
tearful
it
is
dreadful
dreadful
she
was
saying
but
cost
me
what
it
may
i
shall
do
my
duty
i
will
come
and
spend
the
night
he
must
not
be
left
like
this
every
moment
is
precious
i
can
t
think
why
his
nieces
put
it
off
perhaps
god
will
help
me
to
find
a
way
to
prepare
him
adieu
prince
may
god
support
you
adieu
ma
bonne
answered
prince
vasili
turning
away
from
her
oh
he
is
in
a
dreadful
state
said
the
mother
to
her
son
when
they
were
in
the
carriage
he
hardly
recognizes
anybody
i
don
t
understand
mamma
what
is
his
attitude
to
pierre
asked
the
son
the
will
will
show
that
my
dear
our
fate
also
depends
on
it
but
why
do
you
expect
that
he
will
leave
us
anything
ah
my
dear
he
is
so
rich
and
we
are
so
poor
well
that
is
hardly
a
sufficient
reason
mamma
oh
heaven
how
ill
he
is
exclaimed
the
mother
chapter
xvii
after
anna
mikhaylovna
had
driven
off
with
her
son
to
visit
count
cyril
vladimirovich
bezukhov
countess
rostova
sat
for
a
long
time
all
alone
applying
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
at
last
she
rang
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
she
said
crossly
to
the
maid
who
kept
her
waiting
some
minutes
don
t
you
wish
to
serve
me
then
i
ll
find
you
another
place
the
countess
was
upset
by
her
friend
s
sorrow
and
humiliating
poverty
and
was
therefore
out
of
sorts
a
state
of
mind
which
with
her
always
found
expression
in
calling
her
maid
my
dear
and
speaking
to
her
with
exaggerated
politeness
i
am
very
sorry
ma
am
answered
the
maid
ask
the
count
to
come
to
me
the
count
came
waddling
in
to
see
his
wife
with
a
rather
guilty
look
as
usual
well
little
countess
what
a
saute
of
game
au
madere
we
are
to
have
my
dear
i
tasted
it
the
thousand
rubles
i
paid
for
taras
were
not
ill
spent
he
is
worth
it
he
sat
down
by
his
wife
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
hands
ruffling
his
gray
hair
what
are
your
commands
little
countess
you
see
my
dear
what
s
that
mess
she
said
pointing
to
his
waistcoat
it
s
the
saute
most
likely
she
added
with
a
smile
well
you
see
count
i
want
some
money
her
face
became
sad
oh
little
countess
and
the
count
began
bustling
to
get
out
his
pocketbook
i
want
a
great
deal
count
i
want
five
hundred
rubles
and
taking
out
her
cambric
handkerchief
she
began
wiping
her
husband
s
waistcoat
yes
immediately
immediately
hey
who
s
there
he
called
out
in
a
tone
only
used
by
persons
who
are
certain
that
those
they
call
will
rush
to
obey
the
summons
send
dmitri
to
me
dmitri
a
man
of
good
family
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
count
s
house
and
now
managed
all
his
affairs
stepped
softly
into
the
room
this
is
what
i
want
my
dear
fellow
said
the
count
to
the
deferential
young
man
who
had
entered
bring
me
he
reflected
a
moment
yes
bring
me
seven
hundred
rubles
yes
but
mind
don
t
bring
me
such
tattered
and
dirty
notes
as
last
time
but
nice
clean
ones
for
the
countess
yes
dmitri
clean
ones
please
said
the
countess
sighing
deeply
when
would
you
like
them
your
excellency
asked
dmitri
allow
me
to
inform
you
but
don
t
be
uneasy
he
added
noticing
that
the
count
was
beginning
to
breathe
heavily
and
quickly
which
was
always
a
sign
of
approaching
anger
i
was
forgetting
do
you
wish
it
brought
at
once
yes
yes
just
so
bring
it
give
it
to
the
countess
what
a
treasure
that
dmitri
is
added
the
count
with
a
smile
when
the
young
man
had
departed
there
is
never
any
impossible
with
him
that
s
a
thing
i
hate
everything
is
possible
ah
money
count
money
how
much
sorrow
it
causes
in
the
world
said
the
countess
but
i
am
in
great
need
of
this
sum
you
my
little
countess
are
a
notorious
spendthrift
said
the
count
and
having
kissed
his
wife
s
hand
he
went
back
to
his
study
when
anna
mikhaylovna
returned
from
count
bezukhov
s
the
money
all
in
clean
notes
was
lying
ready
under
a
handkerchief
on
the
countess
little
table
and
anna
mikhaylovna
noticed
that
something
was
agitating
her
well
my
dear
asked
the
countess
oh
what
a
terrible
state
he
is
in
one
would
not
know
him
he
is
so
ill
i
was
only
there
a
few
moments
and
hardly
said
a
word
annette
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
refuse
me
the
countess
began
with
a
blush
that
looked
very
strange
on
her
thin
dignified
elderly
face
and
she
took
the
money
from
under
the
handkerchief
anna
mikhaylovna
instantly
guessed
her
intention
and
stooped
to
be
ready
to
embrace
the
countess
at
the
appropriate
moment
this
is
for
boris
from
me
for
his
outfit
anna
mikhaylovna
was
already
embracing
her
and
weeping
the
countess
wept
too
they
wept
because
they
were
friends
and
because
they
were
kindhearted
and
because
they
friends
from
childhood
had
to
think
about
such
a
base
thing
as
money
and
because
their
youth
was
over
but
those
tears
were
pleasant
to
them
both
chapter
xviii
countess
rostova
with
her
daughters
and
a
large
number
of
guests
was
already
seated
in
the
drawing
room
the
count
took
the
gentlemen
into
his
study
and
showed
them
his
choice
collection
of
turkish
pipes
from
time
to
time
he
went
out
to
ask
hasn
t
she
come
yet
they
were
expecting
marya
dmitrievna
akhrosimova
known
in
society
as
le
terrible
dragon
a
lady
distinguished
not
for
wealth
or
rank
but
for
common
sense
and
frank
plainness
of
speech
marya
dmitrievna
was
known
to
the
imperial
family
as
well
as
to
all
moscow
and
petersburg
and
both
cities
wondered
at
her
laughed
privately
at
her
rudenesses
and
told
good
stories
about
her
while
none
the
less
all
without
exception
respected
and
feared
her
in
the
count
s
room
which
was
full
of
tobacco
smoke
they
talked
of
the
war
that
had
been
announced
in
a
manifesto
and
about
the
recruiting
none
of
them
had
yet
seen
the
manifesto
but
they
all
knew
it
had
appeared
the
count
sat
on
the
sofa
between
two
guests
who
were
smoking
and
talking
he
neither
smoked
nor
talked
but
bending
his
head
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
watched
the
smokers
with
evident
pleasure
and
listened
to
the
conversation
of
his
two
neighbors
whom
he
egged
on
against
each
other
one
of
them
was
a
sallow
clean
shaven
civilian
with
a
thin
and
wrinkled
face
already
growing
old
though
he
was
dressed
like
a
most
fashionable
young
man
he
sat
with
his
legs
up
on
the
sofa
as
if
quite
at
home
and
having
stuck
an
amber
mouthpiece
far
into
his
mouth
was
inhaling
the
smoke
spasmodically
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
this
was
an
old
bachelor
shinshin
a
cousin
of
the
countess
a
man
with
a
sharp
tongue
as
they
said
in
moscow
society
he
seemed
to
be
condescending
to
his
companion
the
latter
a
fresh
rosy
officer
of
the
guards
irreproachably
washed
brushed
and
buttoned
held
his
pipe
in
the
middle
of
his
mouth
and
with
red
lips
gently
inhaled
the
smoke
letting
it
escape
from
his
handsome
mouth
in
rings
this
was
lieutenant
berg
an
officer
in
the
semenov
regiment
with
whom
boris
was
to
travel
to
join
the
army
and
about
whom
natasha
had
teased
her
elder
sister
vera
speaking
of
berg
as
her
intended
the
count
sat
between
them
and
listened
attentively
his
favorite
occupation
when
not
playing
boston
a
card
game
he
was
very
fond
of
was
that
of
listener
especially
when
he
succeeded
in
setting
two
loquacious
talkers
at
one
another
well
then
old
chap
mon
tres
honorable
alphonse
karlovich
said
shinshin
laughing
ironically
and
mixing
the
most
ordinary
russian
expressions
with
the
choicest
french
phrases
which
was
a
peculiarity
of
his
speech
vous
comptez
vous
faire
des
rentes
sur
l
etat
you
want
to
make
something
out
of
your
company
you
expect
to
make
an
income
out
of
the
government
no
peter
nikolaevich
i
only
want
to
show
that
in
the
cavalry
the
advantages
are
far
less
than
in
the
infantry
just
consider
my
own
position
now
peter
nikolaevich
berg
always
spoke
quietly
politely
and
with
great
precision
his
conversation
always
related
entirely
to
himself
he
would
remain
calm
and
silent
when
the
talk
related
to
any
topic
that
had
no
direct
bearing
on
himself
he
could
remain
silent
for
hours
without
being
at
all
put
out
of
countenance
himself
or
making
others
uncomfortable
but
as
soon
as
the
conversation
concerned
himself
he
would
begin
to
talk
circumstantially
and
with
evident
satisfaction
consider
my
position
peter
nikolaevich
were
i
in
the
cavalry
i
should
get
not
more
than
two
hundred
rubles
every
four
months
even
with
the
rank
of
lieutenant
but
as
it
is
i
receive
two
hundred
and
thirty
said
he
looking
at
shinshin
and
the
count
with
a
joyful
pleasant
smile
as
if
it
were
obvious
to
him
that
his
success
must
always
be
the
chief
desire
of
everyone
else
besides
that
peter
nikolaevich
by
exchanging
into
the
guards
i
shall
be
in
a
more
prominent
position
continued
berg
and
vacancies
occur
much
more
frequently
in
the
foot
guards
then
just
think
what
can
be
done
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
rubles
i
even
manage
to
put
a
little
aside
and
to
send
something
to
my
father
he
went
on
emitting
a
smoke
ring
la
balance
y
est
a
german
knows
how
to
skin
a
flint
as
the
proverb
says
remarked
shinshin
moving
his
pipe
to
the
other
side
of
his
mouth
and
winking
at
the
count
so
that
squares
matters
the
count
burst
out
laughing
the
other
guests
seeing
that
shinshin
was
talking
came
up
to
listen
berg
oblivious
of
irony
or
indifference
continued
to
explain
how
by
exchanging
into
the
guards
he
had
already
gained
a
step
on
his
old
comrades
of
the
cadet
corps
how
in
wartime
the
company
commander
might
get
killed
and
he
as
senior
in
the
company
might
easily
succeed
to
the
post
how
popular
he
was
with
everyone
in
the
regiment
and
how
satisfied
his
father
was
with
him
berg
evidently
enjoyed
narrating
all
this
and
did
not
seem
to
suspect
that
others
too
might
have
their
own
interests
but
all
he
said
was
so
prettily
sedate
and
the
naivete
of
his
youthful
egotism
was
so
obvious
that
he
disarmed
his
hearers
well
my
boy
you
ll
get
along
wherever
you
go
foot
or
horse
that
i
ll
warrant
said
shinshin
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
and
taking
his
feet
off
the
sofa
berg
smiled
joyously
the
count
followed
by
his
guests
went
into
the
drawing
room
it
was
just
the
moment
before
a
big
dinner
when
the
assembled
guests
expecting
the
summons
to
zakuska
avoid
engaging
in
any
long
conversation
but
think
it
necessary
to
move
about
and
talk
in
order
to
show
that
they
are
not
at
all
impatient
for
their
food
the
host
and
hostess
look
toward
the
door
and
now
and
then
glance
at
one
another
and
the
visitors
try
to
guess
from
these
glances
who
or
what
they
are
waiting
for
some
important
relation
who
has
not
yet
arrived
or
a
dish
that
is
not
yet
ready
hors
d
oeuvres
pierre
had
come
just
at
dinnertime
and
was
sitting
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
room
on
the
first
chair
he
had
come
across
blocking
the
way
for
everyone
the
countess
tried
to
make
him
talk
but
he
went
on
naively
looking
around
through
his
spectacles
as
if
in
search
of
somebody
and
answered
all
her
questions
in
monosyllables
he
was
in
the
way
and
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
notice
the
fact
most
of
the
guests
knowing
of
the
affair
with
the
bear
looked
with
curiosity
at
this
big
stout
quiet
man
wondering
how
such
a
clumsy
modest
fellow
could
have
played
such
a
prank
on
a
policeman
you
have
only
lately
arrived
the
countess
asked
him
oui
madame
replied
he
looking
around
him
you
have
not
yet
seen
my
husband
non
madame
he
smiled
quite
inappropriately
you
have
been
in
paris
recently
i
believe
i
suppose
it
s
very
interesting
very
interesting
the
countess
exchanged
glances
with
anna
mikhaylovna
the
latter
understood
that
she
was
being
asked
to
entertain
this
young
man
and
sitting
down
beside
him
she
began
to
speak
about
his
father
but
he
answered
her
as
he
had
the
countess
only
in
monosyllables
the
other
guests
were
all
conversing
with
one
another
the
razumovskis
it
was
charming
you
are
very
kind
countess
apraksina
was
heard
on
all
sides
the
countess
rose
and
went
into
the
ballroom
marya
dmitrievna
came
her
voice
from
there
herself
came
the
answer
in
a
rough
voice
and
marya
dmitrievna
entered
the
room
all
the
unmarried

marya
dmitrievna
paused
at
the
door
tall
and
stout
holding
high
her
fifty
year
old
head
with
its
gray
curls
she
stood
surveying
the
guests
and
leisurely
arranged
her
wide
sleeves
as
if
rolling
them
up
marya
dmitrievna
always
spoke
in
russian
health
and
happiness
to
her
whose
name
day
we
are
keeping
and
to
her
children
she
said
in
her
loud
full
toned
voice
which
drowned
all
others

went
on

to
the
count

she
how

my
cossack
marya
dmitrievna
always
called
natasha
a
cossack
and
she
stroked
the
child
s
arm
as
she
came
up
fearless
and
gay
to
kiss
her
hand
i
know
she
s
a
scamp
of
a
girl
but
i
like
her
she
took
a
pair
of
pear
shaped
ruby
earrings
from
her
huge
reticule
and
having
given
them
to
the
rosy
natasha
who
beamed
with
the
pleasure
of
her
saint
s
day
fete
turned
away
at
once
and
addressed
herself
to
pierre

here
a
bit
said
she
assuming
a
soft
high
tone
of
voice
come

my
friend
and
she
ominously
tucked
up
her
sleeves
still
higher
pierre
approached
looking
at
her
in
a
childlike
way
through
his
spectacles
come
nearer
come
nearer
friend
i
used
to
be
the
only
one
to
tell
your
father
the
truth
when
he
was
in
favor
and
in
your
case
it
s
my
evident
duty
she
paused
all
were
silent
expectant
of
what
was
to
follow
for
this
was
clearly
only
a
prelude
a
fine
lad
my
word
a
fine
lad
his
father
lies
on
his
deathbed
and
he
amuses
himself
setting
a
policeman
astride
a
bear
for
shame
sir
for
shame
it
would
be
better
if
you
went
to
the
war
she
turned
away
and
gave
her
hand
to
the
count
who
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
well
i
suppose
it
is
time
we
were
at
table
said
marya
dmitrievna
the
count
went
in
first
with
marya
dmitrievna
the
countess
followed
on
the
arm
of
a
colonel
of
hussars
a
man
of
importance
to
them
because
nicholas
was
to
go
with
him
to
the
regiment
then
came
anna
mikhaylovna
with
shinshin
berg
gave
his
arm
to
vera
the
smiling
julie
karagina
went
in
with
nicholas
after
them
other
couples
followed
filling
the
whole
dining
hall
and
last
of
all
the
children
tutors
and
governesses
followed
singly
the
footmen
began
moving
about
chairs
scraped
the
band
struck
up
in
the
gallery
and
the
guests
settled
down
in
their
places
then
the
strains
of
the
count
s
household
band
were
replaced
by
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
the
voices
of
visitors
and
the
soft
steps
of
the
footmen
at
one
end
of
the
table
sat
the
countess
with
marya
dmitrievna
on
her
right
and
anna
mikhaylovna
on
her
left
the
other
lady
visitors
were
farther
down
at
the
other
end
sat
the
count
with
the
hussar
colonel
on
his
left
and
shinshin
and
the
other
male
visitors
on
his
right
midway
down
the
long
table
on
one
side
sat
the
grown
up
young
people
vera
beside
berg
and
pierre
beside
boris
and
on
the
other
side
the
children
tutors
and
governesses
from
behind
the
crystal
decanters
and
fruit
vases
the
count
kept
glancing
at
his
wife
and
her
tall
cap
with
its
light
blue
ribbons
and
busily
filled
his
neighbors
glasses
not
neglecting
his
own
the
countess
in
turn
without
omitting
her
duties
as
hostess
threw
significant
glances
from
behind
the
pineapples
at
her
husband
whose
face
and
bald
head
seemed
by
their
redness
to
contrast
more
than
usual
with
his
gray
hair
at
the
ladies
end
an
even
chatter
of
voices
was
heard
all
the
time
at
the
men
s
end
the
voices
sounded
louder
and
louder
especially
that
of
the
colonel
of
hussars
who
growing
more
and
more
flushed
ate
and
drank
so
much
that
the
count
held
him
up
as
a
pattern
to
the
other
guests
berg
with
tender
smiles
was
saying
to
vera
that
love
is
not
an
earthly
but
a
heavenly
feeling
boris
was
telling
his
new
friend
pierre
who
the
guests
were
and
exchanging
glances
with
natasha
who
was
sitting
opposite
pierre
spoke
little
but
examined
the
new
faces
and
ate
a
great
deal
of
the
two
soups
he
chose
turtle
with
savory
patties
and
went
on
to
the
game
without
omitting
a
single
dish
or
one
of
the
wines
these
latter
the
butler
thrust
mysteriously
forward
wrapped
in
a
napkin
from
behind
the
next
man
s
shoulders
and
whispered
dry
madeira
hungarian
or
rhine
wine
as
the
case
might
be
of
the
four
crystal
glasses
engraved
with
the
count
s
monogram
that
stood
before
his
plate
pierre
held
out
one
at
random
and
drank
with
enjoyment
gazing
with
ever
increasing
amiability
at
the
other
guests
natasha
who
sat
opposite
was
looking
at
boris
as
girls
of
thirteen
look
at
the
boy
they
are
in
love
with
and
have
just
kissed
for
the
first
time
sometimes
that
same
look
fell
on
pierre
and
that
funny
lively
little
girl
s
look
made
him
inclined
to
laugh
without
knowing
why
nicholas
sat
at
some
distance
from
sonya
beside
julie
karagina
to
whom
he
was
again
talking
with
the
same
involuntary
smile
sonya
wore
a
company
smile
but
was
evidently
tormented
by
jealousy
now
she
turned
pale
now
blushed
and
strained
every
nerve
to
overhear
what
nicholas
and
julie
were
saying
to
one
another
the
governess
kept
looking
round
uneasily
as
if
preparing
to
resent
any
slight
that
might
be
put
upon
the
children
the
german
tutor
was
trying
to
remember
all
the
dishes
wines
and
kinds
of
dessert
in
order
to
send
a
full
description
of
the
dinner
to
his
people
in
germany
and
he
felt
greatly
offended
when
the
butler
with
a
bottle
wrapped
in
a
napkin
passed
him
by
he
frowned
trying
to
appear
as
if
he
did
not
want
any
of
that
wine
but
was
mortified
because
no
one
would
understand
that
it
was
not
to
quench
his
thirst
or
from
greediness
that
he
wanted
it
but
simply
from
a
conscientious
desire
for
knowledge
chapter
xix
at
the
men
s
end
of
the
table
the
talk
grew
more
and
more
animated
the
colonel
told
them
that
the
declaration
of
war
had
already
appeared
in
petersburg
and
that
a
copy
which
he
had
himself
seen
had
that
day
been
forwarded
by
courier
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
why
the
deuce
are
we
going
to
fight
bonaparte
remarked
shinshin
he
has
stopped
austria
s
cackle
and
i
fear
it
will
be
our
turn
next
the
colonel
was
a
stout
tall
plethoric
german
evidently
devoted
to
the
service
and
patriotically
russian
he
resented
shinshin
s
remark
it
is
for
the
reasson
my
goot
sir
said
he
speaking
with
a
german
accent
for
the
reasson

and
zat
ze

and

of

as
vell
as
ze
sanctity
of
its
alliances
he
spoke
this
last
word
with
particular
emphasis
as
if
in
it
lay
the
gist
of
the
matter
then
with
the
unerring
official
memory
that
characterized
him
he
repeated
from
the
opening
words
of
the
manifesto
and
the
wish
which
constitutes
the
emperor
s
sole
and
absolute
aim
to
establish
peace
in
europe
on
firm
foundations
has
now
decided
him
to
despatch
part
of
the
army
abroad
and
to
create
a
new
condition
for
the
attainment
of
that
purpose
zat
my
dear
sir
is
vy
he
concluded
drinking
a
tumbler
of
wine
with
dignity
and
looking
to
the
count
for
approval

le
proverbe

said
shinshin
puckering
his
brows
and
smiling
cela

suvorov
now
he
knew
what
he
was
about
yet
they
beat
him
a
plate
couture
and
where
are
we
to
find
suvorovs
now
je
vous
demande
un

said
he
continually
changing
from
french
to
russian
do
you
know
the
proverb
that
suits
us
down
to
the
ground
hollow
i
just
ask
you
that
ve

to
the
last
tr

said
the
colonel
thumping
the
table
and
ve
must
tie
for
our
emperor
and
zen
all
vill
pe
vell
and
ve
must
discuss
it
as
little
as
po

he
dwelt
particularly
on
the
word
possible
as
po
o
ossible
he
ended
again
turning
to
the
count
zat
is
how
ve
old
hussars
look
at
it
and
zere
s
an
end
of
it
and
how
do
you
a
young
man
and
a
young
hussar
how
do
you
judge
of
it
he
added
addressing
nicholas
who
when
he
heard
that
the
war
was
being
discussed
had
turned
from
his
partner
with
eyes
and
ears
intent
on
the
colonel
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
replied
nicholas
flaming
up
turning
his
plate
round
and
moving
his
wineglasses
about
with
as
much
decision
and
desperation
as
though
he
were
at
that
moment
facing
some
great
danger
i
am
convinced
that
we
russians
must
die
or
conquer
he
concluded
conscious
as
were
others
after
the
words
were
uttered
that
his
remarks
were
too
enthusiastic
and
emphatic
for
the
occasion
and
were
therefore
awkward
what
you
said
just
now
was
splendid
said
his
partner
julie
sonya
trembled
all
over
and
blushed
to
her
ears
and
behind
them
and
down
to
her
neck
and
shoulders
while
nicholas
was
speaking
pierre
listened
to
the
colonel
s
speech
and
nodded
approvingly
that
s
fine
said
he
the
young
man
s
a
real
hussar
shouted
the
colonel
again
thumping
the
table
what
are
you
making
such
a
noise
about
over
there
marya
dmitrievna
s
deep
voice
suddenly
inquired
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
what
are
you
thumping
the
table
for
she
demanded
of
the
hussar
and
why
are
you
exciting
yourself
do
you
think
the
french
are
here
i
am
speaking
ze
truce
replied
the
hussar
with
a
smile
it
s
all
about
the
war
the
count
shouted
down
the
table
you

my

may
die
in
your
bed
or
god
may
spare
you
in
a
battle
replied
marya
dmitrievna
s
deep
voice
which
easily
carried
the
whole
length
of
the
table
that
s
true
once
more
the
conversations
concentrated
the
ladies
at
the
one
end
and
the
men
s
at
the
other
you
won
t
ask
natasha
s
little
brother
was
saying
i
know
you
won
t
ask
i
will
replied
natasha
her
face
suddenly
flushed
with
reckless
and
joyous
resolution
she
half
rose
by
a
glance
inviting
pierre
who
sat
opposite
to
listen
to
what
was
coming
and
turning
to
her
mother
mamma
rang
out
the
clear
contralto
notes
of
her
childish
voice
audible
the
whole
length
of
the
table
what
is
it
asked
the
countess
startled
but
seeing
by
her
daughter
s
face
that
it
was
only
mischief
she
shook
a
finger
at
her
sternly
with
a
threatening
and
forbidding
movement
of
her
head
the
conversation
was
hushed
mamma
what
sweets
are
we
going
to
have
and
natasha
s
voice
sounded
still
more
firm
and
resolute
the
countess
tried
to
frown
but
could
not
marya
dmitrievna
shook
her
fat
finger
cossack
she
said
threateningly
most
of
the
guests
uncertain
how
to
regard
this
sally
looked
at
the
elders
you
had
better
take
care
said
the
countess
mamma
what
sweets
are
we
going
to
have
natasha
again
cried
boldly
with
saucy
gaiety
confident
that
her
prank
would
be
taken
in
good
part
sonya
and
fat
little
petya
doubled
up
with
laughter
you
see
i
have
asked
whispered
natasha
to
her
little
brother
and
to
pierre
glancing
at
him
again
ice
pudding
but
you
won
t
get
any
said
marya
dmitrievna
natasha
saw
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
and
so
she
braved
even
marya
dmitrievna
marya
dmitrievna
what
kind
of
ice
pudding
i
don
t
like
ice
cream
carrot
ices
no
what
kind
marya
dmitrievna
what
kind
she
almost
screamed
i
want
to
know
marya
dmitrievna
and
the
countess
burst
out
laughing
and
all
the
guests
joined
in
everyone
laughed
not
at
marya
dmitrievna
s
answer
but
at
the
incredible
boldness
and
smartness
of
this
little
girl
who
had
dared
to
treat
marya
dmitrievna
in
this
fashion
natasha
only
desisted
when
she
had
been
told
that
there
would
be
pineapple
ice
before
the
ices
champagne
was
served
round
the
band
again
struck
up
the
count
and
countess
kissed
and
the
guests
leaving
their
seats
went
up
to
congratulate
the
countess
and
reached
across
the
table
to
clink
glasses
with
the
count
with
the
children
and
with
one
another
again
the
footmen
rushed
about
chairs
scraped
and
in
the
same
order
in
which
they
had
entered
but
with
redder
faces
the
guests
returned
to
the
drawing
room
and
to
the
count
s
study
chapter
xx
the
card
tables
were
drawn
out
sets
made
up
for
boston
and
the
count
s
visitors
settled
themselves
some
in
the
two
drawing
rooms
some
in
the
sitting
room
some
in
the
library
the
count
holding
his
cards
fanwise
kept
himself
with
difficulty
from
dropping
into
his
usual
after
dinner
nap
and
laughed
at
everything
the
young
people
at
the
countess
instigation
gathered
round
the
clavichord
and
harp
julie
by
general
request
played
first
after
she
had
played
a
little
air
with
variations
on
the
harp
she
joined
the
other
young
ladies
in
begging
natasha
and
nicholas
who
were
noted
for
their
musical
talent
to
sing
something
natasha
who
was
treated
as
though
she
were
grown
up
was
evidently
very
proud
of
this
but
at
the
same
time
felt
shy
what
shall
we
sing
she
said
the
brook
suggested
nicholas
well
then
let
s
be
quick
boris
come
here
said
natasha
but
where
is
sonya
she
looked
round
and
seeing
that
her
friend
was
not
in
the
room
ran
to
look
for
her
running
into
sonya
s
room
and
not
finding
her
there
natasha
ran
to
the
nursery
but
sonya
was
not
there
either
natasha
concluded
that
she
must
be
on
the
chest
in
the
passage
the
chest
in
the
passage
was
the
place
of
mourning
for
the
younger
female
generation
in
the
rostov
household
and
there
in
fact
was
sonya
lying
face
downward
on
nurse
s
dirty
feather
bed
on
the
top
of
the
chest
crumpling
her
gauzy
pink
dress
under
her
hiding
her
face
with
her
slender
fingers
and
sobbing
so
convulsively
that
her
bare
little
shoulders
shook
natasha
s
face
which
had
been
so
radiantly
happy
all
that
saint
s
day
suddenly
changed
her
eyes
became
fixed
and
then
a
shiver
passed
down
her
broad
neck
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drooped
sonya
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
oo
oo
oo
and
natasha
s
large
mouth
widened
making
her
look
quite
ugly
and
she
began
to
wail
like
a
baby
without
knowing
why
except
that
sonya
was
crying
sonya
tried
to
lift
her
head
to
answer
but
could
not
and
hid
her
face
still
deeper
in
the
bed
natasha
wept
sitting
on
the
blue
striped
feather
bed
and
hugging
her
friend
with
an
effort
sonya
sat
up
and
began
wiping
her
eyes
and
explaining
nicholas
is
going
away
in
a
week
s
time
his
papers
have
come
he
told
me
himself
but
still
i
should
not
cry
and
she
showed
a
paper
she
held
in
her
hand
with
the
verses
nicholas
had
written
still
i
should
not
cry
but
you
can
t
no
one
can
understand
what
a
soul
he
has
and
she
began
to
cry
again
because
he
had
such
a
noble
soul
it
s
all
very
well
for
you
i
am
not
envious
i
love
you
and
boris
also
she
went
on
gaining
a
little
strength
he
is
nice
there
are
no
difficulties
in
your
way
but
nicholas
is
my
cousin
one
would
have
to
the
metropolitan
himself
and
even
then
it
can
t
be
done
and
besides
if
she
tells
mamma
sonya
looked
upon
the
countess
as
her
mother
and
called
her
so
that
i
am
spoiling
nicholas
career
and
am
heartless
and
ungrateful
while
truly
god
is
my
witness
and
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
i
love
her
so
much
and
all
of
you
only
vera
and
what
for
what
have
i
done
to
her
i
am
so
grateful
to
you
that
i
would
willingly
sacrifice
everything
only
i
have
nothing
sonya
could
not
continue
and
again
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
in
the
feather
bed
natasha
began
consoling
her
but
her
face
showed
that
she
understood
all
the
gravity
of
her
friend
s
trouble
sonya
she
suddenly
exclaimed
as
if
she
had
guessed
the
true
reason
of
her
friend
s
sorrow
i
m
sure
vera
has
said
something
to
you
since

hasn
t
she
yes

verses
nicholas
wrote
himself
and
i
copied
some
others
and
she
found
them
on
my
table
and
said
she
d
show
them
to
mamma
and
that
i
was
ungrateful
and
that
mamma
would
never
allow
him
to
marry
me

julie
you
see
how
he
s
been
with
her
all
day
natasha
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
it
and
again
she
began
to
sob
more
bitterly
than
before
natasha
lifted
her
up
hugged
her
and
smiling
through
her
tears
began
comforting
her
sonya
don
t
believe
her
darling

t
believe

do
you
remember
how
we
and
nicholas
all
three
of

talked
in
the
sitting
room
after
supper
why
we
settled
how
everything
was
to

i
don
t

that

and

good
said
natasha

sonya
and
she
kissed
her
and
laughed
vera
s
spiteful
never

and
all

and
she
won
t
say

he
doesn
t
care
at
all
for
julie
natasha
kissed
her
on
the
hair
sonya
sat
up
the
little
kitten
brightened
its
eyes
shone
and
it
seemed
ready
to
lift
its
tail
jump
down
on
its
soft
paws
and
begin
playing
with
the
ball
of
worsted
as
a
kitten
should
do
you
think
so
really
truly
she
said
quickly
smoothing
her
frock
and
hair
really
truly
answered
natasha
pushing
in
a
crisp
lock
that
had
strayed
from
under
her
friend
s
plaits
both
laughed
well
let
s
go
and
sing
the
brook
come
along
do
you
know
that
fat
pierre
who
sat
opposite
me
is
so
funny
said
natasha
stopping
suddenly
i
feel
so
happy
and
she
set
off
at
a
run
along
the
passage
sonya
shaking
off
some
down
which
clung
to
her
and
tucking
away
the
verses
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
close
to
her
bony
little
chest
ran
after
natasha
down
the
passage
into
the
sitting
room
with
flushed
face
and
light
joyous
steps
at
the
visitors
request
the
young
people
sang
the
quartette
the
brook
with
which
everyone
was
delighted
then
nicholas
sang
a
song
he
had
just
learned
at
nighttime
in
the
moon
s
fair
glow
how
sweet
as
fancies
wander
free
to
feel
that
in
this
world
there
s
one
who
still
is
thinking
but
of
thee
that
while
her
fingers
touch
the
harp
wafting
sweet
music
o
er
the
lea
it
is
for
thee
thus
swells
her
heart
sighing
its
message
out
to
thee
a
day
or
two
then
bliss
unspoilt
but
oh
till
then
i
cannot
live
he
had
not
finished
the
last
verse
before
the
young
people
began
to
get
ready
to
dance
in
the
large
hall
and
the
sound
of
the
feet
and
the
coughing
of
the
musicians
were
heard
from
the
gallery
pierre
was
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
where
shinshin
had
engaged
him
as
a
man
recently
returned
from
abroad
in
a
political
conversation
in
which
several
others
joined
but
which
bored
pierre
when
the
music
began
natasha
came
in
and
walking
straight
up
to
pierre
said
laughing
and
blushing
mamma
told
me
to
ask
you
to
join
the
dancers
i
am
afraid
of
mixing
the
figures
pierre
replied
but
if
you
will
be
my
teacher
and
lowering
his
big
arm
he
offered
it
to
the
slender
little
girl
while
the
couples
were
arranging
themselves
and
the
musicians
tuning
up
pierre
sat
down
with
his
little
partner
natasha
was
perfectly
happy
she
was
dancing
with
a
grown
up
man
who
had
been
abroad
she
was
sitting
in
a
conspicuous
place
and
talking
to
him
like
a
grown
up
lady
she
had
a
fan
in
her
hand
that
one
of
the
ladies
had
given
her
to
hold
assuming
quite
the
pose
of
a
society
woman
heaven
knows
when
and
where
she
had
learned
it
she
talked
with
her
partner
fanning
herself
and
smiling
over
the
fan
dear
dear
just
look
at
her
exclaimed
the
countess
as
she
crossed
the
ballroom
pointing
to
natasha
natasha
blushed
and
laughed
well
really
mamma
why
should
you
what
is
there
to
be
surprised
at
in
the
midst
of
the
third
ecossaise
there
was
a
clatter
of
chairs
being
pushed
back
in
the
sitting
room
where
the
count
and
marya
dmitrievna
had
been
playing
cards
with
the
majority
of
the
more
distinguished
and
older
visitors
they
now
stretching
themselves
after
sitting
so
long
and
replacing
their
purses
and
pocketbooks
entered
the
ballroom
first
came
marya
dmitrievna
and
the
count
both
with
merry
countenances
the
count
with
playful
ceremony
somewhat
in
ballet
style
offered
his
bent
arm
to
marya
dmitrievna
he
drew
himself
up
a
smile
of
debonair
gallantry
lit
up
his
face
and
as
soon
as
the
last
figure
of
the
ecossaise
was
ended
he
clapped
his
hands
to
the
musicians
and
shouted
up
to
their
gallery
addressing
the
first
violin
semen
do
you
know
the
daniel
cooper
this
was
the
count
s
favorite
dance
which
he
had
danced
in
his
youth
strictly
speaking
daniel
cooper
was
one
figure
of
the
anglaise
look
at
papa
shouted
natasha
to
the
whole
company
and
quite
forgetting
that
she
was
dancing
with
a
grown
up
partner
she
bent
her
curly
head
to
her
knees
and
made
the
whole
room
ring
with
her
laughter
and
indeed
everybody
in
the
room
looked
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
at
the
jovial
old
gentleman
who
standing
beside
his
tall
and
stout
partner
marya
dmitrievna
curved
his
arms
beat
time
straightened
his
shoulders
turned
out
his
toes
tapped
gently
with
his
foot
and
by
a
smile
that
broadened
his
round
face
more
and
more
prepared
the
onlookers
for
what
was
to
follow
as
soon
as
the
provocatively
gay
strains
of
daniel
cooper
somewhat
resembling
those
of
a
merry
peasant
dance
began
to
sound
all
the
doorways
of
the
ballroom
were
suddenly
filled
by
the
domestic
serfs
the
men
on
one
side
and
the
women
on
the
other
who
with
beaming
faces
had
come
to
see
their
master
making
merry
just
look
at
the
master
a
regular
eagle
he
is
loudly
remarked
the
nurse
as
she
stood
in
one
of
the
doorways
the
count
danced
well
and
knew
it
but
his
partner
could
not
and
did
not
want
to
dance
well
her
enormous
figure
stood
erect
her
powerful
arms
hanging
down
she
had
handed
her
reticule
to
the
countess
and
only
her
stern
but
handsome
face
really
joined
in
the
dance
what
was
expressed
by
the
whole
of
the
count
s
plump
figure
in
marya
dmitrievna
found
expression
only
in
her
more
and
more
beaming
face
and
quivering
nose
but
if
the
count
getting
more
and
more
into
the
swing
of
it
charmed
the
spectators
by
the
unexpectedness
of
his
adroit
maneuvers
and
the
agility
with
which
he
capered
about
on
his
light
feet
marya
dmitrievna
produced
no
less
impression
by
slight
exertions
the
least
effort
to
move
her
shoulders
or
bend
her
arms
when
turning
or
stamp
her
foot
which
everyone
appreciated
in
view
of
her
size
and
habitual
severity
the
dance
grew
livelier
and
livelier
the
other
couples
could
not
attract
a
moment
s
attention
to
their
own
evolutions
and
did
not
even
try
to
do
so
all
were
watching
the
count
and
marya
dmitrievna
natasha
kept
pulling
everyone
by
sleeve
or
dress
urging
them
to
look
at
papa
though
as
it
was
they
never
took
their
eyes
off
the
couple
in
the
intervals
of
the
dance
the
count
breathing
deeply
waved
and
shouted
to
the
musicians
to
play
faster
faster
faster
and
faster
lightly
more
lightly
and
yet
more
lightly
whirled
the
count
flying
round
marya
dmitrievna
now
on
his
toes
now
on
his
heels
until
turning
his
partner
round
to
her
seat
he
executed
the
final
pas
raising
his
soft
foot
backwards
bowing
his
perspiring
head
smiling
and
making
a
wide
sweep
with
his
arm
amid
a
thunder
of
applause
and
laughter
led
by
natasha
both
partners
stood
still
breathing
heavily
and
wiping
their
faces
with
their
cambric
handkerchiefs
that
s
how
we
used
to
dance
in
our
time

chapter
xxi
while
in
the
rostovs
ballroom
the
sixth
anglaise
was
being
danced
to
a
tune
in
which
the
weary
musicians
blundered
and
while
tired
footmen
and
cooks
were
getting
the
supper
count
bezukhov
had
a
sixth
stroke
the
doctors
pronounced
recovery
impossible
after
a
mute
confession
communion
was
administered
to
the
dying
man
preparations
made
for
the
sacrament
of
unction
and
in
his
house
there
was
the
bustle
and
thrill
of
suspense
usual
at
such
moments
outside
the
house
beyond
the
gates
a
group
of
undertakers
who
hid
whenever
a
carriage
drove
up
waited
in
expectation
of
an
important
order
for
an
expensive
funeral
the
military
governor
of
moscow
who
had
been
assiduous
in
sending
aides
de
camp
to
inquire
after
the
count
s
health
came
himself
that
evening
to
bid
a
last
farewell
to
the
celebrated
grandee
of
catherine
s
court
count
bezukhov
the
magnificent
reception
room
was
crowded
everyone
stood
up
respectfully
when
the
military
governor
having
stayed
about
half
an
hour
alone
with
the
dying
man
passed
out
slightly
acknowledging
their
bows
and
trying
to
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
glances
fixed
on
him
by
the
doctors
clergy
and
relatives
of
the
family
prince
vasili
who
had
grown
thinner
and
paler
during
the
last
few
days
escorted
him
to
the
door
repeating
something
to
him
several
times
in
low
tones
when
the
military
governor
had
gone
prince
vasili
sat
down
all
alone
on
a
chair
in
the
ballroom
crossing
one
leg
high
over
the
other
leaning
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
after
sitting
so
for
a
while
he
rose
and
looking
about
him
with
frightened
eyes
went
with
unusually
hurried
steps
down
the
long
corridor
leading
to
the
back
of
the
house
to
the
room
of
the
eldest
princess
those
who
were
in
the
dimly
lit
reception
room
spoke
in
nervous
whispers
and
whenever
anyone
went
into
or
came
from
the
dying
man
s
room
grew
silent
and
gazed
with
eyes
full
of
curiosity
or
expectancy
at
his
door
which
creaked
slightly
when
opened
the
limits
of
human
life
are
fixed
and
may
not
be
o
erpassed
said
an
old
priest
to
a
lady
who
had
taken
a
seat
beside
him
and
was
listening
naively
to
his
words
i
wonder
is
it
not
too
late
to
administer
unction
asked
the
lady
adding
the
priest
s
clerical
title
as
if
she
had
no
opinion
of
her
own
on
the
subject
ah
madam
it
is
a
great
sacrament
replied
the
priest
passing
his
hand
over
the
thin
grizzled
strands
of
hair
combed
back
across
his
bald
head
who
was
that
the
military
governor
himself
was
being
asked
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
how
young
looking
he
is
yes
and
he
is
over
sixty
i

sacrament
seven
times
the
second
princess
had
just
come
from
the
sickroom
with
her
eyes
red
from
weeping
and
sat
down
beside
dr
lorrain
who
was
sitting
in
a
graceful
pose
under
a
portrait
of
catherine
leaning
his
elbow
on
a
table

the
doctor
in
answer
to
a
remark
about
the
weather

moscow

the
princess
with
a
sigh
so

may
have
something
to

lorrain
considered

taken
his
medicine
yes
the
doctor
glanced
at
his
watch
take
a
glass
of
boiled
water
and
put
a
pinch
of
cream
of
tartar
and
he
indicated
with
his
delicate
fingers
what
he
meant
by
a
pinch

a
whisper

replied
the
german
with
a
smile
everyone
again
looked
toward
the
door
which
creaked
as
the
second
princess
went
in
with
the
drink
she
had
prepared
according
to
lorrain
s
instructions
the
german
doctor
went
up

the
german
addressing

pronounced

up
his
lips
waved
a
severely
negative
finger
before
his
nose

said
he
in
a
low
voice
and
he
moved
away
with
a
decorous
smile
of
self
satisfaction
at
being
able
clearly
to
understand
and
state
the
patient
s
condition
meanwhile
prince
vasili
had
opened
the
door
into
the
princess
room
in
this
room
it
was
almost
dark
only
two
tiny
lamps
were
burning
before
the
icons
and
there
was
a
pleasant
scent
of
flowers
and
burnt
pastilles
the
room
was
crowded
with
small
pieces
of
furniture
whatnots
cupboards
and
little
tables
the
quilt
of
a
high
white
feather
bed
was
just
visible

screen
a
small
dog
began
to
bark
ah

she
rose
and
smoothed
her
hair
which
was
as

made
of
one
piece
with
her
head

covered
with
varnish

her
hand
and
bending
it
downwards
as
was
his
habit
it
was
plain
that
this
well
referred
to
much
that
they
both
understood
without
naming
the
princess
who
had
a
straight
rigid
body
abnormally
long
for
her
legs
looked
directly
at
prince
vasili
with
no
sign
of
emotion
in
her
prominent
gray
eyes
then
she
shook
her
head
and
glanced
up
at
the
icons
with
a
sigh
this
might
have
been
taken
as
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
devotion
or
of
weariness
and
hope
of
resting
before
long
prince
vasili
understood
it
as
an
expression
of
weariness
and
i
he
said
do
you
think
it
is
easier
for
me
i
am
as
worn
out
as
a
post
horse
but
still
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
catiche
a
very
serious
talk
prince
vasili
said
no
more
and
his
cheeks
began
to
twitch
nervously
now
on
one
side
now
on
the
other
giving
his
face
an
unpleasant
expression
which
was
never
to
be
seen
on
it
in
a
drawing
room
his
eyes
too
seemed
strange
at
one
moment
they
looked
impudently
sly
and
at
the
next
glanced
round
in
alarm
the
princess
holding
her
little
dog
on
her
lap
with
her
thin
bony
hands
looked
attentively
into
prince
vasili
s
eyes
evidently
resolved
not
to
be
the
first
to
break
silence
if
she
had
to
wait
till
morning
well
you
see
my
dear
princess
and
cousin
catherine
semenovna
continued
prince
vasili
returning
to
his
theme
apparently
not
without
an
inner
struggle
at
such
a
moment
as
this
one
must
think
of
everything
one
must
think
of
the
future
of
all
of
you
i
love
you
all
like
children
of
my
own
as
you
know
the
princess
continued
to
look
at
him
without
moving
and
with
the
same
dull
expression
and
then
of
course
my
family
has
also
to
be
considered
prince
vasili
went
on
testily
pushing
away
a
little
table
without
looking
at
her
you
know
catiche
that
we
you
three
sisters
mamontov
and
my
wife
are
the
count
s
only
direct
heirs
i
know
i
know
how
hard
it
is
for
you
to
talk
or
think
of
such
matters
it
is
no
easier
for
me
but
my
dear
i
am
getting
on
for
sixty
and
must
be
prepared
for
anything
do
you
know
i
have
sent
for
pierre
the
count
pointing
to
his
portrait
definitely
demanded
that
he
should
be
called
prince
vasili
looked
questioningly
at
the
princess
but
could
not
make
out
whether
she
was
considering
what
he
had
just
said
or
whether
she
was
simply
looking
at
him
there
is
one
thing
i
constantly
pray
god
to
grant
mon
cousin
she
replied
and
it
is
that
he
would
be
merciful
to
him
and
would
allow
his
noble
soul
peacefully
to
leave
this
yes
yes
of
course
interrupted
prince
vasili
impatiently
rubbing
his
bald
head
and
angrily
pulling
back
toward
him
the
little
table
that
he
had
pushed
away
but
in
short
the
fact
is
you
know
yourself
that
last
winter
the
count
made
a
will
by
which
he
left
all
his
property
not
to
us
his
direct
heirs
but
to
pierre
he
has
made
wills
enough
quietly
remarked
the
princess
but
he
cannot
leave
the
estate
to
pierre
pierre
is
illegitimate
but
my
dear
said
prince
vasili
suddenly
clutching
the
little
table
and
becoming
more
animated
and
talking
more
rapidly
what
if
a
letter
has
been
written
to
the
emperor
in
which
the
count
asks
for
pierre
s
legitimation
do
you
understand
that
in
consideration
of
the
count
s
services
his
request
would
be
granted
the
princess
smiled
as
people
do
who
think
they
know
more
about
the
subject
under
discussion
than
those
they
are
talking
with
i
can
tell
you
more
continued
prince
vasili
seizing
her
hand
that
letter
was
written
though
it
was
not
sent
and
the
emperor
knew
of
it
the
only
question
is
has
it
been
destroyed
or
not
if
not
then
as
soon
as
all
is
over
and
prince
vasili
sighed
to
intimate
what
he
meant
by
the
words
all
is
over
and
the
count
s
papers
are
opened
the
will
and
letter
will
be
delivered
to
the
emperor
and
the
petition
will
certainly
be
granted
pierre
will
get
everything
as
the
legitimate
son
and
our
share
asked
the
princess
smiling
ironically
as
if
anything
might
happen
only
not
that
but
my
poor
catiche
it
is
as
clear
as
daylight
he
will
then
be
the
legal
heir
to
everything
and
you
won
t
get
anything
you
must
know
my
dear
whether
the
will
and
letter
were
written
and
whether
they
have
been
destroyed
or
not
and
if
they
have
somehow
been
overlooked
you
ought
to
know
where
they
are
and
must
find
them
because
what
next
the
princess
interrupted
smiling
sardonically
and
not
changing
the
expression
of
her
eyes
i
am
a
woman
and
you
think
we
are
all
stupid
but
i
know
this
an
illegitimate
son
cannot
inherit
un
batard
she
added
as
if
supposing
that
this
translation
of
the
word
would
effectively
prove
to
prince
vasili
the
invalidity
of
his
contention
a
bastard
well
really
catiche
can
t
you
understand
you
are
so
intelligent
how
is
it
you
don
t
see
that
if
the
count
has
written
a
letter
to
the
emperor
begging
him
to
recognize
pierre
as
legitimate
it
follows
that
pierre
will
not
be
pierre
but
will
become
count
bezukhov
and
will
then
inherit
everything
under
the
will
and
if
the
will
and
letter
are
not
destroyed
then
you
will
have
nothing
but
the
consolation
of
having
been
dutiful
et
tout
ce
qui
s
ensuit
that
s
certain
and
all
that
follows
therefrom
i
know
the
will
was
made
but
i
also
know
that
it
is
invalid
and
you
mon
cousin
seem
to
consider
me
a
perfect
fool
said
the
princess
with
the
expression
women
assume
when
they
suppose
they
are
saying
something
witty
and
stinging
my
dear
princess
catherine
semenovna
began
prince
vasili
impatiently
i
came
here
not
to
wrangle
with
you
but
to
talk
about
your
interests
as
with
a
kinswoman
a
good
kind
true
relation
and
i
tell
you
for
the
tenth
time
that
if
the
letter
to
the
emperor
and
the
will
in
pierre
s
favor
are
among
the
count
s
papers
then
my
dear
girl
you
and
your
sisters
are
not
heiresses
if
you
don
t
believe
me
then
believe
an
expert
i
have
just
been
talking
to
dmitri
onufrich
the
family
solicitor
and
he
says
the
same
at
this
a
sudden
change
evidently
took
place
in
the
princess
ideas
her
thin
lips
grew
white
though
her
eyes
did
not
change
and
her
voice
when
she
began
to
speak
passed
through
such
transitions
as
she
herself
evidently
did
not
expect
that
would
be
a
fine
thing
said
she
i
never
wanted
anything
and
i
don
t
now
she
pushed
the
little
dog
off
her
lap
and
smoothed
her
dress
and
this
is
gratitude
this
is
recognition
for
those
who
have
sacrificed
everything
for
his
sake
she
cried
it
s
splendid
fine
i
don
t
want
anything
prince
yes
but
you
are
not
the
only
one
there
are
your
sisters
replied
prince
vasili
but
the
princess
did
not
listen
to
him
yes
i
knew
it
long
ago
but
had
forgotten
i
knew
that
i
could
expect
nothing
but
meanness
deceit
envy
intrigue
and
ingratitude
the
blackest
ingratitude
in
this
house
do
you
or
do
you
not
know
where
that
will
is
insisted
prince
vasili
his
cheeks
twitching
more
than
ever
yes
i
was
a
fool
i
still
believed
in
people
loved
them
and
sacrificed
myself
but
only
the
base
the
vile
succeed
i
know
who
has
been
intriguing
the
princess
wished
to
rise
but
the
prince
held
her
by
the
hand
she
had
the
air
of
one
who
has
suddenly
lost
faith
in
the
whole
human
race
she
gave
her
companion
an
angry
glance
there
is
still
time
my
dear
you
must
remember
catiche
that
it
was
all
done
casually
in
a
moment
of
anger
of
illness
and
was
afterwards
forgotten
our
duty
my
dear
is
to
rectify
his
mistake
to
ease
his
last
moments
by
not
letting
him
commit
this
injustice
and
not
to
let
him
die
feeling
that
he
is
rendering
unhappy
those
who
who
sacrificed
everything
for
him
chimed
in
the
princess
who
would
again
have
risen
had
not
the
prince
still
held
her
fast
though
he
never
could
appreciate
it
no
mon
cousin
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
shall
always
remember
that
in
this
world
one
must
expect
no
reward
that
in
this
world
there
is
neither
honor
nor
justice
in
this
world
one
has
to
be
cunning
and
cruel
now
come
come
be
reasonable
i
know
your
excellent
heart
no
i
have
a
wicked
heart
i
know
your
heart
repeated
the
prince
i
value
your
friendship
and
wish
you
to
have
as
good
an
opinion
of
me
don
t
upset
yourself
and
let
us
talk
sensibly
while
there
is
still
time
be
it
a
day
or
be
it
but
an
hour
tell
me
all
you
know
about
the
will
and
above
all
where
it
is
you
must
know
we
will
take
it
at
once
and
show
it
to
the
count
he
has
no
doubt
forgotten
it
and
will
wish
to
destroy
it
you
understand
that
my
sole
desire
is
conscientiously
to
carry
out
his
wishes
that
is
my
only
reason
for
being
here
i
came
simply
to
help
him
and
you
now
i
see
it
all
i
know
who
has
been
intriguing
i
know
cried
the
princess
that
s
not
the
point
my
dear
it
s
that
protege
of
yours
that
sweet
princess
drubetskaya
that
anna
mikhaylovna
whom
i
would
not
take
for
a
housemaid
the
infamous
vile
woman
do
not
let
us
lose
any
time
ah
don
t
talk
to
me
last
winter
she
wheedled
herself
in
here
and
told
the
count
such
vile
disgraceful
things
about
us
especially
about
sophie
i
can
t
repeat
them
that
it
made
the
count
quite
ill
and
he
would
not
see
us
for
a
whole
fortnight
i
know
it
was
then
he
wrote
this
vile
infamous
paper
but
i
thought
the
thing
was
invalid
we
ve
got
to
it
at
last
why
did
you
not
tell
me
about
it
sooner
it
s
in
the
inlaid
portfolio
that
he
keeps
under
his
pillow
said
the
princess
ignoring
his
question
now
i
know
yes
if
i
have
a
sin
a
great
sin
it
is
hatred
of
that
vile
woman
almost
shrieked
the
princess
now
quite
changed
and
what
does
she
come
worming
herself
in
here
for
but
i
will
give
her
a
piece
of
my
mind
the
time
will
come
chapter
xxii
while
these
conversations
were
going
on
in
the
reception
room
and
the
princess
room
a
carriage
containing
pierre
who
had
been
sent
for
and
anna
mikhaylovna
who
found
it
necessary
to
accompany
him
was
driving
into
the
court
of
count
bezukhov
s
house
as
the
wheels
rolled
softly
over
the
straw
beneath
the
windows
anna
mikhaylovna
having
turned
with
words
of
comfort
to
her
companion
realized
that
he
was
asleep
in
his
corner
and
woke
him
up
rousing
himself
pierre
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
out
of
the
carriage
and
only
then
began
to
think
of
the
interview
with
his
dying
father
which
awaited
him
he
noticed
that
they
had
not
come
to
the
front
entrance
but
to
the
back
door
while
he
was
getting
down
from
the
carriage
steps
two
men
who
looked
like
tradespeople
ran
hurriedly
from
the
entrance
and
hid
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
pausing
for
a
moment
pierre
noticed
several
other
men
of
the
same
kind
hiding
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
on
both
sides
but
neither
anna
mikhaylovna
nor
the
footman
nor
the
coachman
who
could
not
help
seeing
these
people
took
any
notice
of
them
it
seems
to
be
all
right
pierre
concluded
and
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
she
hurriedly
ascended
the
narrow
dimly
lit
stone
staircase
calling
to
pierre
who
was
lagging
behind
to
follow
though
he
did
not
see
why
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
go
to
the
count
at
all
still
less
why
he
had
to
go
by
the
back
stairs
yet
judging
by
anna
mikhaylovna
s
air
of
assurance
and
haste
pierre
concluded
that
it
was
all
absolutely
necessary
halfway
up
the
stairs
they
were
almost
knocked
over
by
some
men
who
carrying
pails
came
running
downstairs
their
boots
clattering
these
men
pressed
close
to
the
wall
to
let
pierre
and
anna
mikhaylovna
pass
and
did
not
evince
the
least
surprise
at
seeing
them
there
is
this
the
way
to
the
princesses
apartments
asked
anna
mikhaylovna
of
one
of
them
yes
replied
a
footman
in
a
bold
loud
voice
as
if
anything
were
now
permissible
the
door
to
the
left
ma
am
perhaps
the
count
did
not
ask
for
me
said
pierre
when
he
reached
the
landing
i
d
better
go
to
my
own
room
anna
mikhaylovna
paused
and
waited
for
him
to
come
up
ah
my
friend
she
said
touching
his
arm
as
she
had
done
her
son
s
when
speaking
to
him
that
afternoon
believe
me
i
suffer
no
less
than
you
do
but
be
a
man
but
really
hadn
t
i
better
go
away
he
asked
looking
kindly
at
her
over
his
spectacles
ah
my
dear
friend
forget
the
wrongs
that
may
have
been
done
you
think
that
he
is
your
father
perhaps
in
the
agony
of
death
she
sighed
i
have
loved
you
like
a
son
from
the
first
trust
yourself
to
me
pierre
i
shall
not
forget
your
interests
pierre
did
not
understand
a
word
but
the
conviction
that
all
this
had
to
be
grew
stronger
and
he
meekly
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
who
was
already
opening
a
door
this
door
led
into
a
back
anteroom
an
old
man
a
servant
of
the
princesses
sat
in
a
corner
knitting
a
stocking
pierre
had
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
house
and
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
these
rooms
anna
mikhaylovna
addressing
a
maid
who
was
hurrying
past
with
a
decanter
on
a
tray
as
my
dear
and
my
sweet
asked
about
the
princess
health
and
then
led
pierre
along
a
stone
passage
the
first
door
on
the
left
led
into
the
princesses
apartments
the
maid
with
the
decanter
in
her
haste
had
not
closed
the
door
everything
in
the
house
was
done
in
haste
at
that
time
and
pierre
and
anna
mikhaylovna
in
passing
instinctively
glanced
into
the
room
where
prince
vasili
and
the
eldest
princess
were
sitting
close
together
talking
seeing
them
pass
prince
vasili
drew
back
with
obvious
impatience
while
the
princess
jumped
up
and
with
a
gesture
of
desperation
slammed
the
door
with
all
her
might
this
action
was
so
unlike
her
usual
composure
and
the
fear
depicted
on
prince
vasili
s
face
so
out
of
keeping
with
his
dignity
that
pierre
stopped
and
glanced
inquiringly
over
his
spectacles
at
his
guide
anna
mikhaylovna
evinced
no
surprise
she
only
smiled
faintly
and
sighed
as
if
to
say
that
this
was
no
more
than
she
had
expected
be
a
man
my
friend
i
will
look
after
your
interests
said
she
in
reply
to
his
look
and
went
still
faster
along
the
passage
pierre
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
all
about
and
still
less
what
watching
over
his
interests
meant
but
he
decided
that
all
these
things
had
to
be
from
the
passage
they
went
into
a
large
dimly
lit
room
adjoining
the
count
s
reception
room
it
was
one
of
those
sumptuous
but
cold
apartments
known
to
pierre
only
from
the
front
approach
but
even
in
this
room
there
now
stood
an
empty
bath
and
water
had
been
spilled
on
the
carpet
they
were
met
by
a
deacon
with
a
censer
and
by
a
servant
who
passed
out
on
tiptoe
without
heeding
them
they
went
into
the
reception
room
familiar
to
pierre
with
two
italian
windows
opening
into
the
conservatory
with
its
large
bust
and
full
length
portrait
of
catherine
the
great
the
same
people
were
still
sitting
here
in
almost
the
same
positions
as
before
whispering
to
one
another
all
became
silent
and
turned
to
look
at
the
pale
tear
worn
anna
mikhaylovna
as
she
entered
and
at
the
big
stout
figure
of
pierre
who
hanging
his
head
meekly
followed
her
anna
mikhaylovna
s
face
expressed
a
consciousness
that
the
decisive
moment
had
arrived
with
the
air
of
a
practical
petersburg
lady
she
now
keeping
pierre
close
beside
her
entered
the
room
even
more
boldly
than
that
afternoon
she
felt
that
as
she
brought
with
her
the
person
the
dying
man
wished
to
see
her
own
admission
was
assured
casting
a
rapid
glance
at
all
those
in
the
room
and
noticing
the
count
s
confessor
there
she
glided
up
to
him
with
a
sort
of
amble
not
exactly
bowing
yet
seeming
to
grow
suddenly
smaller
and
respectfully
received
the
blessing
first
of
one
and
then
of
another
priest
god
be
thanked
that
you
are
in
time
said
she
to
one
of
the
priests
all
we
relatives
have
been
in
such
anxiety
this
young
man
is
the
count
s
son
she
added
more
softly
what
a
terrible
moment
having
said
this
she
went
up
to
the
doctor
dear
doctor
said
she
this
young
man
is
the
count
s
son
is
there
any
hope
the
doctor
cast
a
rapid
glance
upwards
and
silently
shrugged
his
shoulders
anna
mikhaylovna
with
just
the
same
movement
raised
her
shoulders
and
eyes
almost
closing
the
latter
sighed
and
moved
away
from
the
doctor
to
pierre
to
him
in
a
particularly
respectful
and
tenderly
sad
voice
she
said
trust
in
his
mercy
and
pointing
out
a
small
sofa
for
him
to
sit
and
wait
for
her
she
went
silently
toward
the
door
that
everyone
was
watching
and
it
creaked
very
slightly
as
she
disappeared
behind
it
pierre
having
made
up
his
mind
to
obey
his
monitress
implicitly
moved
toward
the
sofa
she
had
indicated
as
soon
as
anna
mikhaylovna
had
disappeared
he
noticed
that
the
eyes
of
all
in
the
room
turned
to
him
with
something
more
than
curiosity
and
sympathy
he
noticed
that
they
whispered
to
one
another
casting
significant
looks
at
him
with
a
kind
of
awe
and
even
servility
a
deference
such
as
he
had
never
before
received
was
shown
him
a
strange
lady
the
one
who
had
been
talking
to
the
priests
rose
and
offered
him
her
seat
an
aide
de
camp
picked
up
and
returned
a
glove
pierre
had
dropped
the
doctors
became
respectfully
silent
as
he
passed
by
and
moved
to
make
way
for
him
at
first
pierre
wished
to
take
another
seat
so
as
not
to
trouble
the
lady
and
also
to
pick
up
the
glove
himself
and
to
pass
round
the
doctors
who
were
not
even
in
his
way
but
all
at
once
he
felt
that
this
would
not
do
and
that
tonight
he
was
a
person
obliged
to
perform
some
sort
of
awful
rite
which
everyone
expected
of
him
and
that
he
was
therefore
bound
to
accept
their
services
he
took
the
glove
in
silence
from
the
aide
de
camp
and
sat
down
in
the
lady
s
chair
placing
his
huge
hands
symmetrically
on
his
knees
in
the
naive
attitude
of
an
egyptian
statue
and
decided
in
his
own
mind
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
and
that
in
order
not
to
lose
his
head
and
do
foolish
things
he
must
not
act
on
his
own
ideas
tonight
but
must
yield
himself
up
entirely
to
the
will
of
those
who
were
guiding
him
not
two
minutes
had
passed
before
prince
vasili
with
head
erect
majestically
entered
the
room
he
was
wearing
his
long
coat
with
three
stars
on
his
breast
he
seemed
to
have
grown
thinner
since
the
morning
his
eyes
seemed
larger
than
usual
when
he
glanced
round
and
noticed
pierre
he
went
up
to
him
took
his
hand
a
thing
he
never
used
to
do
and
drew
it
downwards
as
if
wishing
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
firmly
fixed
on
courage
courage
my
friend
he
has
asked
to
see
you
that
is
well
and
he
turned
to
go
but
pierre
thought
it
necessary
to
ask
how
is
and
hesitated
not
knowing
whether
it
would
be
proper
to
call
the
dying
man
the
count
yet
ashamed
to
call
him
father
he
had
another
stroke
about
half
an
hour
ago
courage
my
friend
pierre
s
mind
was
in
such
a
confused
state
that
the
word
stroke
suggested
to
him
a
blow
from
something
he
looked
at
prince
vasili
in
perplexity
and
only
later
grasped
that
a
stroke
was
an
attack
of
illness
prince
vasili
said
something
to
lorrain
in
passing
and
went
through
the
door
on
tiptoe
he
could
not
walk
well
on
tiptoe
and
his
whole
body
jerked
at
each
step
the
eldest
princess
followed
him
and
the
priests
and
deacons
and
some
servants
also
went
in
at
the
door
through
that
door
was
heard
a
noise
of
things
being
moved
about
and
at
last
anna
mikhaylovna
still
with
the
same
expression
pale
but
resolute
in
the
discharge
of
duty
ran
out
and
touching
pierre
lightly
on
the
arm
said
the
divine
mercy
is
inexhaustible
unction
is
about
to
be
administered
come
pierre
went
in
at
the
door
stepping
on
the
soft
carpet
and
noticed
that
the
strange
lady
the
aide
de
camp
and
some
of
the
servants
all
followed
him
in
as
if
there
were
now
no
further
need
for
permission
to
enter
that
room
chapter
xxiii
pierre
well
knew
this
large
room
divided
by
columns
and
an
arch
its
walls
hung
round
with
persian
carpets
the
part
of
the
room
behind
the
columns
with
a
high
silk
curtained
mahogany
bedstead
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
an
immense
case
containing
icons
was
brightly
illuminated
with
red
light
like
a
russian
church
during
evening
service
under
the
gleaming
icons
stood
a
long
invalid
chair
and
in
that
chair
on
snowy
white
smooth
pillows
evidently
freshly
changed
pierre
saw
covered
to
the
waist
by
a
bright
green
quilt
the
familiar
majestic
figure
of
his
father
count
bezukhov
with
that
gray
mane
of
hair
above
his
broad
forehead
which
reminded
one
of
a
lion
and
the
deep
characteristically
noble
wrinkles
of
his
handsome
ruddy
face
he
lay
just
under
the
icons
his
large
thick
hands
outside
the
quilt
into
the
right
hand
which
was
lying
palm
downwards
a
wax
taper
had
been
thrust
between
forefinger
and
thumb
and
an
old
servant
bending
over
from
behind
the
chair
held
it
in
position
by
the
chair
stood
the
priests
their
long
hair
falling
over
their
magnificent
glittering
vestments
with
lighted
tapers
in
their
hands
slowly
and
solemnly
conducting
the
service
a
little
behind
them
stood
the
two
younger
princesses
holding
handkerchiefs
to
their
eyes
and
just
in
front
of
them
their
eldest
sister
catiche
with
a
vicious
and
determined
look
steadily
fixed
on
the
icons
as
though
declaring
to
all
that
she
could
not
answer
for
herself
should
she
glance
round
anna
mikhaylovna
with
a
meek
sorrowful
and
all
forgiving
expression
on
her
face
stood
by
the
door
near
the
strange
lady
prince
vasili
in
front
of
the
door
near
the
invalid
chair
a
wax
taper
in
his
left
hand
was
leaning
his
left
arm
on
the
carved
back
of
a
velvet
chair
he
had
turned
round
for
the
purpose
and
was
crossing
himself
with
his
right
hand
turning
his
eyes
upward
each
time
he
touched
his
forehead
his
face
wore
a
calm
look
of
piety
and
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
if
you
do
not
understand
these
sentiments
he
seemed
to
be
saying
so
much
the
worse
for
you
behind
him
stood
the
aide
de
camp
the
doctors
and
the
menservants
the
men
and
women
had
separated
as
in
church
all
were
silently
crossing
themselves
and
the
reading
of
the
church
service
the
subdued
chanting
of
deep
bass
voices
and
in
the
intervals
sighs
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
were
the
only
sounds
that
could
be
heard
anna
mikhaylovna
with
an
air
of
importance
that
showed
that
she
felt
she
quite
knew
what
she
was
about
went
across
the
room
to
where
pierre
was
standing
and
gave
him
a
taper
he
lit
it
and
distracted
by
observing
those
around
him
began
crossing
himself
with
the
hand
that
held
the
taper
sophie
the
rosy
laughter
loving
youngest
princess
with
the
mole
watched
him
she
smiled
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
remained
with
it
hidden
for
awhile
then
looking
up
and
seeing
pierre
she
again
began
to
laugh
she
evidently
felt
unable
to
look
at
him
without
laughing
but
could
not
resist
looking
at
him
so
to
be
out
of
temptation
she
slipped
quietly
behind
one
of
the
columns
in
the
midst
of
the
service
the
voices
of
the
priests
suddenly
ceased
they
whispered
to
one
another
and
the
old
servant
who
was
holding
the
count
s
hand
got
up
and
said
something
to
the
ladies
anna
mikhaylovna
stepped
forward
and
stooping
over
the
dying
man
beckoned
to
lorrain
from
behind
her
back
the
french
doctor
held
no
taper
he
was
leaning
against
one
of
the
columns
in
a
respectful
attitude
implying
that
he
a
foreigner
in
spite
of
all
differences
of
faith
understood
the
full
importance
of
the
rite
now
being
performed
and
even
approved
of
it
he
now
approached
the
sick
man
with
the
noiseless
step
of
one
in
full
vigor
of
life
with
his
delicate
white
fingers
raised
from
the
green
quilt
the
hand
that
was
free
and
turning
sideways
felt
the
pulse
and
reflected
a
moment
the
sick
man
was
given
something
to
drink
there
was
a
stir
around
him
then
the
people
resumed
their
places
and
the
service
continued
during
this
interval
pierre
noticed
that
prince
vasili
left
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
leaning
and
with
an
air
which
intimated
that
he
knew
what
he
was
about
and
if
others
did
not
understand
him
it
was
so
much
the
worse
for
them
did
not
go
up
to
the
dying
man
but
passed
by
him
joined
the
eldest
princess
and
moved
with
her
to
the
side
of
the
room
where
stood
the
high
bedstead
with
its
silken
hangings
on
leaving
the
bed
both
prince
vasili
and
the
princess
passed
out
by
a
back
door
but
returned
to
their
places
one
after
the
other
before
the
service
was
concluded
pierre
paid
no
more
attention
to
this
occurrence
than
to
the
rest
of
what
went
on
having
made
up
his
mind
once
for
all
that
what
he
saw
happening
around
him
that
evening
was
in
some
way
essential
the
chanting
of
the
service
ceased
and
the
voice
of
the
priest
was
heard
respectfully
congratulating
the
dying
man
on
having
received
the
sacrament
the
dying
man
lay
as
lifeless
and
immovable
as
before
around
him
everyone
began
to
stir
steps
were
audible
and
whispers
among
which
anna
mikhaylovna
s
was
the
most
distinct
pierre
heard
her
say
certainly
he
must
be
moved
onto
the
bed
here
it
will
be
impossible
the
sick
man
was
so
surrounded
by
doctors
princesses
and
servants
that
pierre
could
no
longer
see
the
reddish
yellow
face
with
its
gray
mane
which
though
he
saw
other
faces
as
well
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
for
a
single
moment
during
the
whole
service
he
judged
by
the
cautious
movements
of
those
who
crowded
round
the
invalid
chair
that
they
had
lifted
the
dying
man
and
were
moving
him
catch
hold
of
my
arm
or
you
ll
drop
him
he
heard
one
of
the
servants
say
in
a
frightened
whisper
catch
hold
from
underneath
here
exclaimed
different
voices
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
bearers
and
the
shuffling
of
their
feet
grew
more
hurried
as
if
the
weight
they
were
carrying
were
too
much
for
them
as
the
bearers
among
whom
was
anna
mikhaylovna
passed
the
young
man
he
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
between
their
heads
and
backs
of
the
dying
man
s
high
stout
uncovered
chest
and
powerful
shoulders
raised
by
those
who
were
holding
him
under
the
armpits
and
of
his
gray
curly
leonine
head
this
head
with
its
remarkably
broad
brow
and
cheekbones
its
handsome
sensual
mouth
and
its
cold
majestic
expression
was
not
disfigured
by
the
approach
of
death
it
was
the
same
as
pierre
remembered
it
three
months
before
when
the
count
had
sent
him
to
petersburg
but
now
this
head
was
swaying
helplessly
with
the
uneven
movements
of
the
bearers
and
the
cold
listless
gaze
fixed
itself
upon
nothing
after
a
few
minutes
bustle
beside
the
high
bedstead
those
who
had
carried
the
sick
man
dispersed
anna
mikhaylovna
touched
pierre
s
hand
and
said
come
pierre
went
with
her
to
the
bed
on
which
the
sick
man
had
been
laid
in
a
stately
pose
in
keeping
with
the
ceremony
just
completed
he
lay
with
his
head
propped
high
on
the
pillows
his
hands
were
symmetrically
placed
on
the
green
silk
quilt
the
palms
downward
when
pierre
came
up
the
count
was
gazing
straight
at
him
but
with
a
look
the
significance
of
which
could
not
be
understood
by
mortal
man
either
this
look
meant
nothing
but
that
as
long
as
one
has
eyes
they
must
look
somewhere
or
it
meant
too
much
pierre
hesitated
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
glanced
inquiringly
at
his
guide
anna
mikhaylovna
made
a
hurried
sign
with
her
eyes
glancing
at
the
sick
man
s
hand
and
moving
her
lips
as
if
to
send
it
a
kiss
pierre
carefully
stretching
his
neck
so
as
not
to
touch
the
quilt
followed
her
suggestion
and
pressed
his
lips
to
the
large
boned
fleshy
hand
neither
the
hand
nor
a
single
muscle
of
the
count
s
face
stirred
once
more
pierre
looked
questioningly
at
anna
mikhaylovna
to
see
what
he
was
to
do
next
anna
mikhaylovna
with
her
eyes
indicated
a
chair
that
stood
beside
the
bed
pierre
obediently
sat
down
his
eyes
asking
if
he
were
doing
right
anna
mikhaylovna
nodded
approvingly
again
pierre
fell
into
the
naively
symmetrical
pose
of
an
egyptian
statue
evidently
distressed
that
his
stout
and
clumsy
body
took
up
so
much
room
and
doing
his
utmost
to
look
as
small
as
possible
he
looked
at
the
count
who
still
gazed
at
the
spot
where
pierre
s
face
had
been
before
he
sat
down
anna
mikhaylovna
indicated
by
her
attitude
her
consciousness
of
the
pathetic
importance
of
these
last
moments
of
meeting
between
the
father
and
son
this
lasted
about
two
minutes
which
to
pierre
seemed
an
hour
suddenly
the
broad
muscles
and
lines
of
the
count
s
face
began
to
twitch
the
twitching
increased
the
handsome
mouth
was
drawn
to
one
side
only
now
did
pierre
realize
how
near
death
his
father
was
and
from
that
distorted
mouth
issued
an
indistinct
hoarse
sound
anna
mikhaylovna
looked
attentively
at
the
sick
man
s
eyes
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
she
pointed
first
to
pierre
then
to
some
drink
then
named
prince
vasili
in
an
inquiring
whisper
then
pointed
to
the
quilt
the
eyes
and
face
of
the
sick
man
showed
impatience
he
made
an
effort
to
look
at
the
servant
who
stood
constantly
at
the
head
of
the
bed
wants
to
turn
on
the
other
side
whispered
the
servant
and
got
up
to
turn
the
count
s
heavy
body
toward
the
wall
pierre
rose
to
help
him
while
the
count
was
being
turned
over
one
of
his
arms
fell
back
helplessly
and
he
made
a
fruitless
effort
to
pull
it
forward
whether
he
noticed
the
look
of
terror
with
which
pierre
regarded
that
lifeless
arm
or
whether
some
other
thought
flitted
across
his
dying
brain
at
any
rate
he
glanced
at
the
refractory
arm
at
pierre
s
terror
stricken
face
and
again
at
the
arm
and
on
his
face
a
feeble
piteous
smile
appeared
quite
out
of
keeping
with
his
features
that
seemed
to
deride
his
own
helplessness
at
sight
of
this
smile
pierre
felt
an
unexpected
quivering
in
his
breast
and
a
tickling
in
his
nose
and
tears
dimmed
his
eyes
the
sick
man
was
turned
on
to
his
side
with
his
face
to
the
wall
he
sighed
he
is
dozing
said
anna
mikhaylovna
observing
that
one
of
the
princesses
was
coming
to
take
her
turn
at
watching
let
us
go
pierre
went
out
chapter
xxiv
there
was
now
no
one
in
the
reception
room
except
prince
vasili
and
the
eldest
princess
who
were
sitting
under
the
portrait
of
catherine
the
great
and
talking
eagerly
as
soon
as
they
saw
pierre
and
his
companion
they
became
silent
and
pierre
thought
he
saw
the
princess
hide
something
as
she
whispered
i
can
t
bear
the
sight
of
that
woman
catiche
has
had
tea
served
in
the
small
drawing
room
said
prince
vasili
to
anna
mikhaylovna
go
and
take
something
my
poor
anna
mikhaylovna
or
you
will
not
hold
out
to
pierre
he
said
nothing
merely
giving
his
arm
a
sympathetic
squeeze
below
the
shoulder
pierre
went
with
anna
mikhaylovna
into
the
small
drawing
room
there
is
nothing
so
refreshing
after
a
sleepless
night
as
a
cup
of
this
delicious
russian
tea
lorrain
was
saying
with
an
air
of
restrained
animation
as
he
stood
sipping
tea
from
a
delicate
chinese
handleless
cup
before
a
table
on
which
tea
and
a
cold
supper
were
laid
in
the
small
circular
room
around
the
table
all
who
were
at
count
bezukhov
s
house
that
night
had
gathered
to
fortify
themselves
pierre
well
remembered
this
small
circular
drawing
room
with
its
mirrors
and
little
tables
during
balls
given
at
the
house
pierre
who
did
not
know
how
to
dance
had
liked
sitting
in
this
room
to
watch
the
ladies
who
as
they
passed
through
in
their
ball
dresses
with
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
shoulders
looked
at
themselves
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
mirrors
which
repeated
their
reflections
several
times
now
this
same
room
was
dimly
lighted
by
two
candles
on
one
small
table
tea
things
and
supper
dishes
stood
in
disorder
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
motley
throng
of
people
sat
there
not
merrymaking
but
somberly
whispering
and
betraying
by
every
word
and
movement
that
they
none
of
them
forgot
what
was
happening
and
what
was
about
to
happen
in
the
bedroom
pierre
did
not
eat
anything
though
he
would
very
much
have
liked
to
he
looked
inquiringly
at
his
monitress
and
saw
that
she
was
again
going
on
tiptoe
to
the
reception
room
where
they
had
left
prince
vasili
and
the
eldest
princess
pierre
concluded
that
this
also
was
essential
and
after
a
short
interval
followed
her
anna
mikhaylovna
was
standing
beside
the
princess
and
they
were
both
speaking
in
excited
whispers
permit
me
princess
to
know
what
is
necessary
and
what
is
not
necessary
said
the
younger
of
the
two
speakers
evidently
in
the
same
state
of
excitement
as
when
she
had
slammed
the
door
of
her
room
but
my
dear
princess
answered
anna
mikhaylovna
blandly
but
impressively
blocking
the
way
to
the
bedroom
and
preventing
the
other
from
passing
won
t
this
be
too
much
for
poor
uncle
at
a
moment
when
he
needs
repose
worldly
conversation
at
a
moment
when
his
soul
is
already
prepared
prince
vasili
was
seated
in
an
easy
chair
in
his
familiar
attitude
with
one
leg
crossed
high
above
the
other
his
cheeks
which
were
so
flabby
that
they
looked
heavier
below
were
twitching
violently
but
he
wore
the
air
of
a
man
little
concerned
in
what
the
two
ladies
were
saying
come
my
dear
anna
mikhaylovna
let
catiche
do
as
she
pleases
you
know
how
fond
the
count
is
of
her
i
don
t
even
know
what
is
in
this
paper
said
the
younger
of
the
two
ladies
addressing
prince
vasili
and
pointing
to
an
inlaid
portfolio
she
held
in
her
hand
all
i
know
is
that
his
real
will
is
in
his
writing
table
and
this
is
a
paper
he
has
forgotten
she
tried
to
pass
anna
mikhaylovna
but
the
latter
sprang
so
as
to
bar
her
path
i
know
my
dear
kind
princess
said
anna
mikhaylovna
seizing
the
portfolio
so
firmly
that
it
was
plain
she
would
not
let
go
easily
dear
princess
i
beg
and
implore
you
have
some
pity
on
him
je
vous
en
conjure
the
princess
did
not
reply
their
efforts
in
the
struggle
for
the
portfolio
were
the
only
sounds
audible
but
it
was
evident
that
if
the
princess
did
speak
her
words
would
not
be
flattering
to
anna
mikhaylovna
though
the
latter
held
on
tenaciously
her
voice
lost
none
of
its
honeyed
firmness
and
softness
pierre
my
dear
come
here
i
think
he
will
not
be
out
of
place
in
a
family
consultation
is
it
not
so
prince
why
don
t
you
speak
cousin
suddenly
shrieked
the
princess
so
loud
that
those
in
the
drawing
room
heard
her
and
were
startled
why
do
you
remain
silent
when
heaven
knows
who
permits
herself
to
interfere
making
a
scene
on
the
very
threshold
of
a
dying
man
s
room
intriguer
she
hissed
viciously
and
tugged
with
all
her
might
at
the
portfolio
but
anna
mikhaylovna
went
forward
a
step
or
two
to
keep
her
hold
on
the
portfolio
and
changed
her
grip
prince
vasili
rose
oh
said
he
with
reproach
and
surprise
this
is
absurd
come
let
go
i
tell
you
the
princess
let
go
and
you
too
but
anna
mikhaylovna
did
not
obey
him
let
go
i
tell
you
i
will
take
the
responsibility
i
myself
will
go
and
ask
him
i
does
that
satisfy
you
but
prince
said
anna
mikhaylovna
after
such
a
solemn
sacrament
allow
him
a
moment
s
peace
here
pierre
tell
them
your
opinion
said
she
turning
to
the
young
man
who
having
come
quite
close
was
gazing
with
astonishment
at
the
angry
face
of
the
princess
which
had
lost
all
dignity
and
at
the
twitching
cheeks
of
prince
vasili
remember
that
you
will
answer
for
the
consequences
said
prince
vasili
severely
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
doing
vile
woman
shouted
the
princess
darting
unexpectedly
at
anna
mikhaylovna
and
snatching
the
portfolio
from
her
prince
vasili
bent
his
head
and
spread
out
his
hands
at
this
moment
that
terrible
door
which
pierre
had
watched
so
long
and
which
had
always
opened
so
quietly
burst
noisily
open
and
banged
against
the
wall
and
the
second
of
the
three
sisters
rushed
out
wringing
her
hands
what
are
you
doing
she
cried
vehemently
he
is
dying
and
you
leave
me
alone
with
him
her
sister
dropped
the
portfolio
anna
mikhaylovna
stooping
quickly
caught
up
the
object
of
contention
and
ran
into
the
bedroom
the
eldest
princess
and
prince
vasili
recovering
themselves
followed
her
a
few
minutes
later
the
eldest
sister
came
out
with
a
pale
hard
face
again
biting
her
underlip
at
sight
of
pierre
her
expression
showed
an
irrepressible
hatred
yes
now
you
may
be
glad
said
she
this
is
what
you
have
been
waiting
for
and
bursting
into
tears
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
rushed
from
the
room
prince
vasili
came
next
he
staggered
to
the
sofa
on
which
pierre
was
sitting
and
dropped
onto
it
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
pierre
noticed
that
he
was
pale
and
that
his
jaw
quivered
and
shook
as
if
in
an
ague
ah
my
friend
said
he
taking
pierre
by
the
elbow
and
there
was
in
his
voice
a
sincerity
and
weakness
pierre
had
never
observed
in
it
before
how
often
we
sin
how
much
we
deceive
and
all
for
what
i
am
near
sixty
dear
friend
i
too
all
will
end
in
death
all
death
is
awful
and
he
burst
into
tears
anna
mikhaylovna
came
out
last
she
approached
pierre
with
slow
quiet
steps
pierre
she
said
pierre
gave
her
an
inquiring
look
she
kissed
the
young
man
on
his
forehead
wetting
him
with
her
tears
then
after
a
pause
she
said
he
is
no
more
pierre
looked
at
her
over
his
spectacles
come
i
will
go
with
you
try
to
weep
nothing
gives
such
relief
as
tears
she
led
him
into
the
dark
drawing
room
and
pierre
was
glad
no
one
could
see
his
face
anna
mikhaylovna
left
him
and
when
she
returned
he
was
fast
asleep
with
his
head
on
his
arm
in
the
morning
anna
mikhaylovna
said
to
pierre
yes
my
dear
this
is
a
great
loss
for
us
all
not
to
speak
of
you
but
god
will
support
you
you
are
young
and
are
now
i
hope
in
command
of
an
immense
fortune
the
will
has
not
yet
been
opened
i
know
you
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
this
will
not
turn
your
head
but
it
imposes
duties
on
you
and
you
must
be
a
man
pierre
was
silent
perhaps
later
on
i
may
tell
you
my
dear
boy
that
if
i
had
not
been
there
god
only
knows
what
would
have
happened
you
know
uncle
promised
me
only
the
day
before
yesterday
not
to
forget
boris
but
he
had
no
time
i
hope
my
dear
friend
you
will
carry
out
your
father
s
wish
pierre
understood
nothing
of
all
this
and
coloring
shyly
looked
in
silence
at
princess
anna
mikhaylovna
after
her
talk
with
pierre
anna
mikhaylovna
returned
to
the
rostovs
and
went
to
bed
on
waking
in
the
morning
she
told
the
rostovs
and
all
her
acquaintances
the
details
of
count
bezukhov
s
death
she
said
the
count
had
died
as
she
would
herself
wish
to
die
that
his
end
was
not
only
touching
but
edifying
as
to
the
last
meeting
between
father
and
son
it
was
so
touching
that
she
could
not
think
of
it
without
tears
and
did
not
know
which
had
behaved
better
during
those
awful
moments
the
father
who
so
remembered
everything
and
everybody
at
last
and
had
spoken
such
pathetic
words
to
the
son
or
pierre
whom
it
had
been
pitiful
to
see
so
stricken
was
he
with
grief
though
he
tried
hard
to
hide
it
in
order
not
to
sadden
his
dying
father
it
is
painful
but
it
does
one
good
it
uplifts
the
soul
to
see
such
men
as
the
old
count
and
his
worthy
son
said
she
of
the
behavior
of
the
eldest
princess
and
prince
vasili
she
spoke
disapprovingly
but
in
whispers
and
as
a
great
secret
chapter
xxv
at
bald
hills
prince
nicholas
andreevich
bolkonski
s
estate
the
arrival
of
young
prince
andrew
and
his
wife
was
daily
expected
but
this
expectation
did
not
upset
the
regular
routine
of
life
in
the
old
prince
s
household
general
in
chief
prince
nicholas
andreevich
nicknamed
in
society
the
king
of
prussia
ever
since
the
emperor
paul
had
exiled
him
to
his
country
estate
had
lived
there
continuously
with
his
daughter
princess
mary
and
her
companion
mademoiselle
bourienne
though
in
the
new
reign
he
was
free
to
return
to
the
capitals
he
still
continued
to
live
in
the
country
remarking
that
anyone
who
wanted
to
see
him
could
come
the
hundred
miles
from
moscow
to
bald
hills
while
he
himself
needed
no
one
and
nothing
he
used
to
say
that
there
are
only
two
sources
of
human
vice
idleness
and
superstition
and
only
two
virtues
activity
and
intelligence
he
himself
undertook
his
daughter
s
education
and
to
develop
these
two
cardinal
virtues
in
her
gave
her
lessons
in
algebra
and
geometry
till
she
was
twenty
and
arranged
her
life
so
that
her
whole
time
was
occupied
he
was
himself
always
occupied
writing
his
memoirs
solving
problems
in
higher
mathematics
turning
snuffboxes
on
a
lathe
working
in
the
garden
or
superintending
the
building
that
was
always
going
on
at
his
estate
as
regularity
is
a
prime
condition
facilitating
activity
regularity
in
his
household
was
carried
to
the
highest
point
of
exactitude
he
always
came
to
table
under
precisely
the
same
conditions
and
not
only
at
the
same
hour
but
at
the
same
minute
with
those
about
him
from
his
daughter
to
his
serfs
the
prince
was
sharp
and
invariably
exacting
so
that
without
being
a
hardhearted
man
he
inspired
such
fear
and
respect
as
few
hardhearted
men
would
have
aroused
although
he
was
in
retirement
and
had
now
no
influence
in
political
affairs
every
high
official
appointed
to
the
province
in
which
the
prince
s
estate
lay
considered
it
his
duty
to
visit
him
and
waited
in
the
lofty
antechamber
just
as
the
architect
gardener
or
princess
mary
did
till
the
prince
appeared
punctually
to
the
appointed
hour
everyone
sitting
in
this
antechamber
experienced
the
same
feeling
of
respect
and
even
fear
when
the
enormously
high
study
door
opened
and
showed
the
figure
of
a
rather
small
old
man
with
powdered
wig
small
withered
hands
and
bushy
gray
eyebrows
which
when
he
frowned
sometimes
hid
the
gleam
of
his
shrewd
youthfully
glittering
eyes
on
the
morning
of
the
day
that
the
young
couple
were
to
arrive
princess
mary
entered
the
antechamber
as
usual
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
morning
greeting
crossing
herself
with
trepidation
and
repeating
a
silent
prayer
every
morning
she
came
in
like
that
and
every
morning
prayed
that
the
daily
interview
might
pass
off
well
an
old
powdered
manservant
who
was
sitting
in
the
antechamber
rose
quietly
and
said
in
a
whisper
please
walk
in
through
the
door
came
the
regular
hum
of
a
lathe
the
princess
timidly
opened
the
door
which
moved
noiselessly
and
easily
she
paused
at
the
entrance
the
prince
was
working
at
the
lathe
and
after
glancing
round
continued
his
work
the
enormous
study
was
full
of
things
evidently
in
constant
use
the
large
table
covered
with
books
and
plans
the
tall
glass
fronted
bookcases
with
keys
in
the
locks
the
high
desk
for
writing
while
standing
up
on
which
lay
an
open
exercise
book
and
the
lathe
with
tools
laid
ready
to
hand
and
shavings
scattered
around
all
indicated
continuous
varied
and
orderly
activity
the
motion
of
the
small
foot
shod
in
a
tartar
boot
embroidered
with
silver
and
the
firm
pressure
of
the
lean
sinewy
hand
showed
that
the
prince
still
possessed
the
tenacious
endurance
and
vigor
of
hardy
old
age
after
a
few
more
turns
of
the
lathe
he
removed
his
foot
from
the
pedal
wiped
his
chisel
dropped
it
into
a
leather
pouch
attached
to
the
lathe
and
approaching
the
table
summoned
his
daughter
he
never
gave
his
children
a
blessing
so
he
simply
held
out
his
bristly
cheek
as
yet
unshaven
and
regarding
her
tenderly
and
attentively
said
severely
quite
well
all
right
then
sit
down
he
took
the
exercise
book
containing
lessons
in
geometry
written
by
himself
and
drew
up
a
chair
with
his
foot
for
tomorrow
said
he
quickly
finding
the
page
and
making
a
scratch
from
one
paragraph
to
another
with
his
hard
nail
the
princess
bent
over
the
exercise
book
on
the
table
wait
a
bit
here
s
a
letter
for
you
said
the
old
man
suddenly
taking
a
letter
addressed
in
a
woman
s
hand
from
a
bag
hanging
above
the
table
onto
which
he
threw
it
at
the
sight
of
the
letter
red
patches
showed
themselves
on
the
princess
face
she
took
it
quickly
and
bent
her
head
over
it
from
heloise
asked
the
prince
with
a
cold
smile
that
showed
his
still
sound
yellowish
teeth
yes
it
s
from
julie
replied
the
princess
with
a
timid
glance
and
a
timid
smile
i
ll
let
two
more
letters
pass
but
the
third
i
ll
read
said
the
prince
sternly
i
m
afraid
you
write
much
nonsense
i
ll
read
the
third
read
this
if
you
like
father
said
the
princess
blushing
still
more
and
holding
out
the
letter
the
third
i
said
the
third
cried
the
prince
abruptly
pushing
the
letter
away
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
table
he
drew
toward
him
the
exercise
book
containing
geometrical
figures
well
madam
he
began
stooping
over
the
book
close
to
his
daughter
and
placing
an
arm
on
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
she
sat
so
that
she
felt
herself
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
acrid
scent
of
old
age
and
tobacco
which
she
had
known
so
long
now
madam
these
triangles
are
equal
please
note
that
the
angle
abc
the
princess
looked
in
a
scared
way
at
her
father
s
eyes
glittering
close
to
her
the
red
patches
on
her
face
came
and
went
and
it
was
plain
that
she
understood
nothing
and
was
so
frightened
that
her
fear
would
prevent
her
understanding
any
of
her
father
s
further
explanations
however
clear
they
might
be
whether
it
was
the
teacher
s
fault
or
the
pupil
s
this
same
thing
happened
every
day
the
princess
eyes
grew
dim
she
could
not
see
and
could
not
hear
anything
but
was
only
conscious
of
her
stern
father
s
withered
face
close
to
her
of
his
breath
and
the
smell
of
him
and
could
think
only
of
how
to
get
away
quickly
to
her
own
room
to
make
out
the
problem
in
peace
the
old
man
was
beside
himself
moved
the
chair
on
which
he
was
sitting
noisily
backward
and
forward
made
efforts
to
control
himself
and
not
become
vehement
but
almost
always
did
become
vehement
scolded
and
sometimes
flung
the
exercise
book
away
the
princess
gave
a
wrong
answer
well
now
isn
t
she
a
fool
shouted
the
prince
pushing
the
book
aside
and
turning
sharply
away
but
rising
immediately
he
paced
up
and
down
lightly
touched
his
daughter
s
hair
and
sat
down
again
he
drew
up
his
chair
and
continued
to
explain
this
won
t
do
princess
it
won
t
do
said
he
when
princess
mary
having
taken
and
closed
the
exercise
book
with
the
next
day
s
lesson
was
about
to
leave
mathematics
are
most
important
madam
i
don
t
want
to
have
you
like
our
silly
ladies
get
used
to
it
and
you
ll
like
it
and
he
patted
her
cheek
it
will
drive
all
the
nonsense
out
of
your
head
she
turned
to
go
but
he
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
and
took
an
uncut
book
from
the
high
desk
here
is
some
sort
of
key
to
the
mysteries
that
your
heloise
has
sent
you
religious
i
don
t
interfere
with
anyone
s
belief
i
have
looked
at
it
take
it
well
now
go
go
he
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
and
himself
closed
the
door
after
her
princess
mary
went
back
to
her
room
with
the
sad
scared
expression
that
rarely
left
her
and
which
made
her
plain
sickly
face
yet
plainer
she
sat
down
at
her
writing
table
on
which
stood
miniature
portraits
and
which
was
littered
with
books
and
papers
the
princess
was
as
untidy
as
her
father
was
tidy
she
put
down
the
geometry
book
and
eagerly
broke
the
seal
of
her
letter
it
was
from
her
most
intimate
friend
from
childhood
that
same
julie
karagina
who
had
been
at
the
rostovs
name
day
party
julie
wrote
in
french
dear
and
precious
friend
how
terrible
and
frightful
a
thing
is
separation
though
i
tell
myself
that
half
my
life
and
half
my
happiness
are
wrapped
up
in
you
and
that
in
spite
of
the
distance
separating
us
our
hearts
are
united
by
indissoluble
bonds
my
heart
rebels
against
fate
and
in
spite
of
the
pleasures
and
distractions
around
me
i
cannot
overcome
a
certain
secret
sorrow
that
has
been
in
my
heart
ever
since
we
parted
why
are
we
not
together
as
we
were
last
summer
in
your
big
study
on
the
blue
sofa
the
confidential
sofa
why
cannot
i
now
as
three
months
ago
draw
fresh
moral
strength
from
your
look
so
gentle
calm
and
penetrating
a
look
i
loved
so
well
and
seem
to
see
before
me
as
i
write
having
read
thus
far
princess
mary
sighed
and
glanced
into
the
mirror
which
stood
on
her
right
it
reflected
a
weak
ungraceful
figure
and
thin
face
her
eyes
always
sad
now
looked
with
particular
hopelessness
at
her
reflection
in
the
glass
she
flatters
me
thought
the
princess
turning
away
and
continuing
to
read
but
julie
did
not
flatter
her
friend
the
princess
eyes
large
deep
and
luminous
it
seemed
as
if
at
times
there
radiated
from
them
shafts
of
warm
light
were
so
beautiful
that
very
often
in
spite
of
the
plainness
of
her
face
they
gave
her
an
attraction
more
powerful
than
that
of
beauty
but
the
princess
never
saw
the
beautiful
expression
of
her
own
eyes
the
look
they
had
when
she
was
not
thinking
of
herself
as
with
everyone
her
face
assumed
a
forced
unnatural
expression
as
soon
as
she
looked
in
a
glass
she
went
on
reading
all
moscow
talks
of
nothing
but
war
one
of
my
two
brothers
is
already
abroad
the
other
is
with
the
guards
who
are
starting
on
their
march
to
the
frontier
our
dear
emperor
has
left
petersburg
and
it
is
thought
intends
to
expose
his
precious
person
to
the
chances
of
war
god
grant
that
the
corsican
monster
who
is
destroying
the
peace
of
europe
may
be
overthrown
by
the
angel
whom
it
has
pleased
the
almighty
in
his
goodness
to
give
us
as
sovereign
to
say
nothing
of
my
brothers
this
war
has
deprived
me
of
one
of
the
associations
nearest
my
heart
i
mean
young
nicholas
rostov
who
with
his
enthusiasm
could
not
bear
to
remain
inactive
and
has
left
the
university
to
join
the
army
i
will
confess
to
you
dear
mary
that
in
spite
of
his
extreme
youth
his
departure
for
the
army
was
a
great
grief
to
me
this
young
man
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
last
summer
is
so
noble
minded
and
full
of
that
real
youthfulness
which
one
seldom
finds
nowadays
among
our
old
men
of
twenty
and
particularly
he
is
so
frank
and
has
so
much
heart
he
is
so
pure
and
poetic
that
my
relations
with
him
transient
as
they
were
have
been
one
of
the
sweetest
comforts
to
my
poor
heart
which
has
already
suffered
so
much
someday
i
will
tell
you
about
our
parting
and
all
that
was
said
then
that
is
still
too
fresh
ah
dear
friend
you
are
happy
not
to
know
these
poignant
joys
and
sorrows
you
are
fortunate
for
the
latter
are
generally
the
stronger
i
know
very
well
that
count
nicholas
is
too
young
ever
to
be
more
to
me
than
a
friend
but
this
sweet
friendship
this
poetic
and
pure
intimacy
were
what
my
heart
needed
but
enough
of
this
the
chief
news
about
which
all
moscow
gossips
is
the
death
of
old
count
bezukhov
and
his
inheritance
fancy
the
three
princesses
have
received
very
little
prince
vasili
nothing
and
it
is
monsieur
pierre
who
has
inherited
all
the
property
and
has
besides
been
recognized
as
legitimate
so
that
he
is
now
count
bezukhov
and
possessor
of
the
finest
fortune
in
russia
it
is
rumored
that
prince
vasili
played
a
very
despicable
part
in
this
affair
and
that
he
returned
to
petersburg
quite
crestfallen
i
confess
i
understand
very
little
about
all
these
matters
of
wills
and
inheritance
but
i
do
know
that
since
this
young
man
whom
we
all
used
to
know
as
plain
monsieur
pierre
has
become
count
bezukhov
and
the
owner
of
one
of
the
largest
fortunes
in
russia
i
am
much
amused
to
watch
the
change
in
the
tone
and
manners
of
the
mammas
burdened
by
marriageable
daughters
and
of
the
young
ladies
themselves
toward
him
though
between
you
and
me
he
always
seemed
to
me
a
poor
sort
of
fellow
as
for
the
past
two
years
people
have
amused
themselves
by
finding
husbands
for
me
most
of
whom
i
don
t
even
know
the
matchmaking
chronicles
of
moscow
now
speak
of
me
as
the
future
countess
bezukhova
but
you
will
understand
that
i
have
no
desire
for
the
post
a
propos
of
marriages
do
you
know
that
a
while
ago
that
universal
auntie
anna
mikhaylovna
told
me
under
the
seal
of
strict
secrecy
of
a
plan
of
marriage
for
you
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
with
prince
vasili
s
son
anatole
whom
they
wish
to
reform
by
marrying
him
to
someone
rich
and
distinguee
and
it
is
on
you
that
his
relations
choice
has
fallen
i
don
t
know
what
you
will
think
of
it
but
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
let
you
know
of
it
he
is
said
to
be
very
handsome
and
a
terrible
scapegrace
that
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
about
him
but
enough
of
gossip
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
second
sheet
of
paper
and
mamma
has
sent
for
me
to
go
and
dine
at
the
apraksins
read
the
mystical
book
i
am
sending
you
it
has
an
enormous
success
here
though
there
are
things
in
it
difficult
for
the
feeble
human
mind
to
grasp
it
is
an
admirable
book
which
calms
and
elevates
the
soul
adieu
give
my
respects
to
monsieur
your
father
and
my
compliments
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
i
embrace
you
as
i
love
you
julie
p
s
let
me
have
news
of
your
brother
and
his
charming
little
wife
the
princess
pondered
awhile
with
a
thoughtful
smile
and
her
luminous
eyes
lit
up
so
that
her
face
was
entirely
transformed
then
she
suddenly
rose
and
with
her
heavy
tread
went
up
to
the
table
she
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
her
hand
moved
rapidly
over
it
this
is
the
reply
she
wrote
also
in
french
dear
and
precious
friend
your
letter
of
the
th
has
given
me
great
delight
so
you
still
love
me
my
romantic
julie
separation
of
which
you
say
so
much
that
is
bad
does
not
seem
to
have
had
its
usual
effect
on
you
you
complain
of
our
separation
what
then
should
i
say
if
i
dared
complain
i
who
am
deprived
of
all
who
are
dear
to
me
ah
if
we
had
not
religion
to
console
us
life
would
be
very
sad
why
do
you
suppose
that
i
should
look
severely
on
your
affection
for
that
young
man
on
such
matters
i
am
only
severe
with
myself
i
understand
such
feelings
in
others
and
if
never
having
felt
them
i
cannot
approve
of
them
neither
do
i
condemn
them
only
it
seems
to
me
that
christian
love
love
of
one
s
neighbor
love
of
one
s
enemy
is
worthier
sweeter
and
better
than
the
feelings
which
the
beautiful
eyes
of
a
young
man
can
inspire
in
a
romantic
and
loving
young
girl
like
yourself
the
news
of
count
bezukhov
s
death
reached
us
before
your
letter
and
my
father
was
much
affected
by
it
he
says
the
count
was
the
last
representative
but
one
of
the
great
century
and
that
it
is
his
own
turn
now
but
that
he
will
do
all
he
can
to
let
his
turn
come
as
late
as
possible
god
preserve
us
from
that
terrible
misfortune
i
cannot
agree
with
you
about
pierre
whom
i
knew
as
a
child
he
always
seemed
to
me
to
have
an
excellent
heart
and
that
is
the
quality
i
value
most
in
people
as
to
his
inheritance
and
the
part
played
by
prince
vasili
it
is
very
sad
for
both
ah
my
dear
friend
our
divine
saviour
s
words
that
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
god
are
terribly
true
i
pity
prince
vasili
but
am
still
more
sorry
for
pierre
so
young
and
burdened
with
such
riches
to
what
temptations
he
will
be
exposed
if
i
were
asked
what
i
desire
most
on
earth
it
would
be
to
be
poorer
than
the
poorest
beggar
a
thousand
thanks
dear
friend
for
the
volume
you
have
sent
me
and
which
has
such
success
in
moscow
yet
since
you
tell
me
that
among
some
good
things
it
contains
others
which
our
weak
human
understanding
cannot
grasp
it
seems
to
me
rather
useless
to
spend
time
in
reading
what
is
unintelligible
and
can
therefore
bear
no
fruit
i
never
could
understand
the
fondness
some
people
have
for
confusing
their
minds
by
dwelling
on
mystical
books
that
merely
awaken
their
doubts
and
excite
their
imagination
giving
them
a
bent
for
exaggeration
quite
contrary
to
christian
simplicity
let
us
rather
read
the
epistles
and
gospels
let
us
not
seek
to
penetrate
what
mysteries
they
contain
for
how
can
we
miserable
sinners
that
we
are
know
the
terrible
and
holy
secrets
of
providence
while
we
remain
in
this
flesh
which
forms
an
impenetrable
veil
between
us
and
the
eternal
let
us
rather
confine
ourselves
to
studying
those
sublime
rules
which
our
divine
saviour
has
left
for
our
guidance
here
below
let
us
try
to
conform
to
them
and
follow
them
and
let
us
be
persuaded
that
the
less
we
let
our
feeble
human
minds
roam
the
better
we
shall
please
god
who
rejects
all
knowledge
that
does
not
come
from
him
and
the
less
we
seek
to
fathom
what
he
has
been
pleased
to
conceal
from
us
the
sooner
will
he
vouchsafe
its
revelation
to
us
through
his
divine
spirit
my
father
has
not
spoken
to
me
of
a
suitor
but
has
only
told
me
that
he
has
received
a
letter
and
is
expecting
a
visit
from
prince
vasili
in
regard
to
this
project
of
marriage
for
me
i
will
tell
you
dear
sweet
friend
that
i
look
on
marriage
as
a
divine
institution
to
which
we
must
conform
however
painful
it
may
be
to
me
should
the
almighty
lay
the
duties
of
wife
and
mother
upon
me
i
shall
try
to
perform
them
as
faithfully
as
i
can
without
disquieting
myself
by
examining
my
feelings
toward
him
whom
he
may
give
me
for
husband
i
have
had
a
letter
from
my
brother
who
announces
his
speedy
arrival
at
bald
hills
with
his
wife
this
pleasure
will
be
but
a
brief
one
however
for
he
will
leave
us
again
to
take
part
in
this
unhappy
war
into
which
we
have
been
drawn
god
knows
how
or
why
not
only
where
you
are
at
the
heart
of
affairs
and
of
the
world
is
the
talk
all
of
war
even
here
amid
fieldwork
and
the
calm
of
nature
which
townsfolk
consider
characteristic
of
the
country
rumors
of
war
are
heard
and
painfully
felt
my
father
talks
of
nothing
but
marches
and
countermarches
things
of
which
i
understand
nothing
and
the
day
before
yesterday
during
my
daily
walk
through
the
village
i
witnessed
a
heartrending
scene
it
was
a
convoy
of
conscripts
enrolled
from
our
people
and
starting
to
join
the
army
you
should
have
seen
the
state
of
the
mothers
wives
and
children
of
the
men
who
were
going
and
should
have
heard
the
sobs
it
seems
as
though
mankind
has
forgotten
the
laws
of
its
divine
saviour
who
preached
love
and
forgiveness
of
injuries
and
that
men
attribute
the
greatest
merit
to
skill
in
killing
one
another
adieu
dear
and
kind
friend
may
our
divine
saviour
and
his
most
holy
mother
keep
you
in
their
holy
and
all
powerful
care
mary
ah
you
are
sending
off
a
letter
princess
i
have
already
dispatched
mine
i
have
written
to
my
poor
mother
said
the
smiling
mademoiselle
bourienne
rapidly
in
her
pleasant
mellow
tones
and
with
guttural
r
s
she
brought
into
princess
mary
s
strenuous
mournful
and
gloomy
world
a
quite
different
atmosphere
careless
lighthearted
and
self
satisfied
princess
i
must
warn
you
she
added
lowering
her
voice
and
evidently
listening
to
herself
with
pleasure
and
speaking
with
exaggerated
grasseyement
the
prince
has
been
scolding
michael
ivanovich
he
is
in
a
very
bad
humor
very
morose
be
prepared
ah
dear
friend
replied
princess
mary
i
have
asked
you
never
to
warn
me
of
the
humor
my
father
is
in
i
do
not
allow
myself
to
judge
him
and
would
not
have
others
do
so
the
princess
glanced
at
her
watch
and
seeing
that
she
was
five
minutes
late
in
starting
her
practice
on
the
clavichord
went
into
the
sitting
room
with
a
look
of
alarm
between
twelve
and
two
o
clock
as
the
day
was
mapped
out
the
prince
rested
and
the
princess
played
the
clavichord
chapter
xxvi
the
gray
haired
valet
was
sitting
drowsily
listening
to
the
snoring
of
the
prince
who
was
in
his
large
study
from
the
far
side
of
the
house
through
the
closed
doors
came
the
sound
of
difficult
passages
twenty
times
repeated
of
a
sonata
by
dussek
just
then
a
closed
carriage
and
another
with
a
hood
drove
up
to
the
porch
prince
andrew
got
out
of
the
carriage
helped
his
little
wife
to
alight
and
let
her
pass
into
the
house
before
him
old
tikhon
wearing
a
wig
put
his
head
out
of
the
door
of
the
antechamber
reported
in
a
whisper
that
the
prince
was
sleeping
and
hastily
closed
the
door
tikhon
knew
that
neither
the
son
s
arrival
nor
any
other
unusual
event
must
be
allowed
to
disturb
the
appointed
order
of
the
day
prince
andrew
apparently
knew
this
as
well
as
tikhon
he
looked
at
his
watch
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
his
father
s
habits
had
changed
since
he
was
at
home
last
and
having
assured
himself
that
they
had
not
he
turned
to
his
wife
he
will
get
up
in
twenty
minutes
let
us
go
across
to
mary
s
room
he
said
the
little
princess
had
grown
stouter
during
this
time
but
her
eyes
and
her
short
downy
smiling
lip
lifted
when
she
began
to
speak
just
as
merrily
and
prettily
as
ever
why
this
is
a
palace
she
said
to
her
husband
looking
around
with
the
expression
with
which
people
compliment
their
host
at
a
ball
let
s
come
quick
quick
and
with
a
glance
round
she
smiled
at
tikhon
at
her
husband
and
at
the
footman
who
accompanied
them
is
that
mary
practicing
let
s
go
quietly
and
take
her
by
surprise
prince
andrew
followed
her
with
a
courteous
but
sad
expression
you
ve
grown
older
tikhon
he
said
in
passing
to
the
old
man
who
kissed
his
hand
before
they
reached
the
room
from
which
the
sounds
of
the
clavichord
came
the
pretty
fair
haired
frenchwoman
mademoiselle
bourienne
rushed
out
apparently
beside
herself
with
delight
ah
what
joy
for
the
princess
exclaimed
she
at
last
i
must
let
her
know
no
no
please
not
you
are
mademoiselle
bourienne
said
the
little
princess
kissing
her
i
know
you
already
through
my
sister
in
law
s
friendship
for
you
she
was
not
expecting
us
they
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
sitting
room
from
which
came
the
sound
of
the
oft
repeated
passage
of
the
sonata
prince
andrew
stopped
and
made
a
grimace
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
the
little
princess
entered
the
room
the
passage
broke
off
in
the
middle
a
cry
was
heard
then
princess
mary
s
heavy
tread
and
the
sound
of
kissing
when
prince
andrew
went
in
the
two
princesses
who
had
only
met
once
before
for
a
short
time
at
his
wedding
were
in
each
other
s
arms
warmly
pressing
their
lips
to
whatever
place
they
happened
to
touch
mademoiselle
bourienne
stood
near
them
pressing
her
hand
to
her
heart
with
a
beatific
smile
and
obviously
equally
ready
to
cry
or
to
laugh
prince
andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
frowned
as
lovers
of
music
do
when
they
hear
a
false
note
the
two
women
let
go
of
one
another
and
then
as
if
afraid
of
being
too
late
seized
each
other
s
hands
kissing
them
and
pulling
them
away
and
again
began
kissing
each
other
on
the
face
and
then
to
prince
andrew
s
surprise
both
began
to
cry
and
kissed
again
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
began
to
cry
prince
andrew
evidently
felt
ill
at
ease
but
to
the
two
women
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
they
should
cry
and
apparently
it
never
entered
their
heads
that
it
could
have
been
otherwise
at
this
meeting
ah
my
dear
ah
mary
they
suddenly
exclaimed
and
then
laughed
i
dreamed
last
night
you
were
not
expecting
us
ah
mary
you
have
got
thinner
and
you
have
grown
stouter
i
knew
the
princess
at
once
put
in
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
i
had
no
idea
exclaimed
princess
mary
ah
andrew
i
did
not
see
you
prince
andrew
and
his
sister
hand
in
hand
kissed
one
another
and
he
told
her
she
was
still
the
same
crybaby
as
ever
princess
mary
had
turned
toward
her
brother
and
through
her
tears
the
loving
warm
gentle
look
of
her
large
luminous
eyes
very
beautiful
at
that
moment
rested
on
prince
andrew
s
face
the
little
princess
talked
incessantly
her
short
downy
upper
lip
continually
and
rapidly
touching
her
rosy
nether
lip
when
necessary
and
drawing
up
again
next
moment
when
her
face
broke
into
a
smile
of
glittering
teeth
and
sparkling
eyes
she
told
of
an
accident
they
had
had
on
the
spasski
hill
which
might
have
been
serious
for
her
in
her
condition
and
immediately
after
that
informed
them
that
she
had
left
all
her
clothes
in
petersburg
and
that
heaven
knew
what
she
would
have
to
dress
in
here
and
that
andrew
had
quite
changed
and
that
kitty
odyntsova
had
married
an
old
man
and
that
there
was
a
suitor
for
mary
a
real
one
but
that
they
would
talk
of
that
later
princess
mary
was
still
looking
silently
at
her
brother
and
her
beautiful
eyes
were
full
of
love
and
sadness
it
was
plain
that
she
was
following
a
train
of
thought
independent
of
her
sister
in
law
s
words
in
the
midst
of
a
description
of
the
last
petersburg
fete
she
addressed
her
brother
so
you
are
really
going
to
the
war
andrew
she
said
sighing
lise
sighed
too
yes
and
even
tomorrow
replied
her
brother
he
is
leaving
me
here
god
knows
why
when
he
might
have
had
promotion
princess
mary
did
not
listen
to
the
end
but
continuing
her
train
of
thought
turned
to
her
sister
in
law
with
a
tender
glance
at
her
figure
is
it
certain
she
said
the
face
of
the
little
princess
changed
she
sighed
and
said
yes
quite
certain
ah
it
is
very
dreadful
her
lip
descended
she
brought
her
face
close
to
her
sister
in
law
s
and
unexpectedly
again
began
to
cry
she
needs
rest
said
prince
andrew
with
a
frown
don
t
you
lise
take
her
to
your
room
and
i
ll
go
to
father
how
is
he
just
the
same
yes
just
the
same
though
i
don
t
know
what
your
opinion
will
be
answered
the
princess
joyfully
and
are
the
hours
the
same
and
the
walks
in
the
avenues
and
the
lathe
asked
prince
andrew
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
which
showed
that
in
spite
of
all
his
love
and
respect
for
his
father
he
was
aware
of
his
weaknesses
the
hours
are
the
same
and
the
lathe
and
also
the
mathematics
and
my
geometry
lessons
said
princess
mary
gleefully
as
if
her
lessons
in
geometry
were
among
the
greatest
delights
of
her
life
when
the
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
and
the
time
had
come
for
the
old
prince
to
get
up
tikhon
came
to
call
the
young
prince
to
his
father
the
old
man
made
a
departure
from
his
usual
routine
in
honor
of
his
son
s
arrival
he
gave
orders
to
admit
him
to
his
apartments
while
he
dressed
for
dinner
the
old
prince
always
dressed
in
old
fashioned
style
wearing
an
antique
coat
and
powdered
hair
and
when
prince
andrew
entered
his
father
s
dressing
room
not
with
the
contemptuous
look
and
manner
he
wore
in
drawing
rooms
but
with
the
animated
face
with
which
he
talked
to
pierre
the
old
man
was
sitting
on
a
large
leather
covered
chair
wrapped
in
a
powdering
mantle
entrusting
his
head
to
tikhon
ah
here
s
the
warrior
wants
to
vanquish
buonaparte
said
the
old
man
shaking
his
powdered
head
as
much
as
the
tail
which
tikhon
was
holding
fast
to
plait
would
allow
you
at
least
must
tackle
him
properly
or
else
if
he
goes
on
like
this
he
ll
soon
have
us
too
for
his
subjects
how
are
you
and
he
held
out
his
cheek
the
old
man
was
in
a
good
temper
after
his
nap
before
dinner
he
used
to
say
that
a
nap
after
dinner
was
silver
before
dinner
golden
he
cast
happy
sidelong
glances
at
his
son
from
under
his
thick
bushy
eyebrows
prince
andrew
went
up
and
kissed
his
father
on
the
spot
indicated
to
him
he
made
no
reply
on
his
father
s
favorite
topic
making
fun
of
the
military
men
of
the
day
and
more
particularly
of
bonaparte
yes
father
i
have
come
to
you
and
brought
my
wife
who
is
pregnant
said
prince
andrew
following
every
movement
of
his
father
s
face
with
an
eager
and
respectful
look
how
is
your
health
only
fools
and
rakes
fall
ill
my
boy
you
know
me
i
am
busy
from
morning
till
night
and
abstemious
so
of
course
i
am
well
thank

said
his
son
smiling
god
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
well
go
on
he
continued
returning
to
his
hobby
tell
me
how
the
germans
have
taught
you
to
fight
bonaparte
by
this
new
science
you
call
strategy
prince
andrew
smiled
give
me
time
to
collect
my
wits
father
said
he
with
a
smile
that
showed
that
his
father
s
foibles
did
not
prevent
his
son
from
loving
and
honoring
him
why
i
have
not
yet
had
time
to
settle
down
nonsense
nonsense
cried
the
old
man
shaking
his
pigtail
to
see
whether
it
was
firmly
plaited
and
grasping
his
by
the
hand
the
house
for
your
wife
is
ready
princess
mary
will
take
her
there
and
show
her
over
and
they
ll
talk
nineteen
to
the
dozen
that
s
their
woman
s
way
i
am
glad
to
have
her
sit
down
and
talk
about
mikhelson
s
army
i
understand
tolstoy
s
too
a
simultaneous
expedition
but
what
s
the
southern
army
to
do
prussia
is
neutral
i
know
that
what
about
austria
said
he
rising
from
his
chair
and
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
followed
by
tikhon
who
ran
after
him
handing
him
different
articles
of
clothing
what
of
sweden
how
will
they
cross
pomerania
prince
andrew
seeing
that
his
father
insisted
began
at
first
reluctantly
but
gradually
with
more
and
more
animation
and
from
habit
changing
unconsciously
from
russian
to
french
as
he
went
on
to
explain
the
plan
of
operation
for
the
coming
campaign
he
explained
how
an
army
ninety
thousand
strong
was
to
threaten
prussia
so
as
to
bring
her
out
of
her
neutrality
and
draw
her
into
the
war
how
part
of
that
army
was
to
join
some
swedish
forces
at
stralsund
how
two
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
austrians
with
a
hundred
thousand
russians
were
to
operate
in
italy
and
on
the
rhine
how
fifty
thousand
russians
and
as
many
english
were
to
land
at
naples
and
how
a
total
force
of
five
hundred
thousand
men
was
to
attack
the
french
from
different
sides
the
old
prince
did
not
evince
the
least
interest
during
this
explanation
but
as
if
he
were
not
listening
to
it
continued
to
dress
while
walking
about
and
three
times
unexpectedly
interrupted
once
he
stopped
it
by
shouting
the
white
one
the
white
one
this
meant
that
tikhon
was
not
handing
him
the
waistcoat
he
wanted
another
time
he
interrupted
saying
and
will
she
soon
be
confined
and
shaking
his
head
reproachfully
said
that
s
bad
go
on
go
on
the
third
interruption
came
when
prince
andrew
was
finishing
his
description
the
old
man
began
to
sing
in
the
cracked
voice
of
old
age
malbrook

marlborough

god

the

i

also
formed
his
plan
by
now
not
worse
than
this
one
well
you
ve
told
me
nothing
new
and
the
old
man
repeated
meditatively
and
rapidly
dieu
sait
quand
reviendra
go
to
the
dining
room
chapter
xxvii
at
the
appointed
hour
the
prince
powdered
and
shaven
entered
the
dining
room
where
his
daughter
in
law
princess
mary
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
were
already
awaiting
him
together
with
his
architect
who
by
a
strange
caprice
of
his
employer
s
was
admitted
to
table
though
the
position
of
that
insignificant
individual
was
such
as
could
certainly
not
have
caused
him
to
expect
that
honor
the
prince
who
generally
kept
very
strictly
to
social
distinctions
and
rarely
admitted
even
important
government
officials
to
his
table
had
unexpectedly
selected
michael
ivanovich
who
always
went
into
a
corner
to
blow
his
nose
on
his
checked
handkerchief
to
illustrate
the
theory
that
all
men
are
equals
and
had
more
than
once
impressed
on
his
daughter
that
michael
ivanovich
was
not
a
whit
worse
than
you
or
i
at
dinner
the
prince
usually
spoke
to
the
taciturn
michael
ivanovich
more
often
than
to
anyone
else
in
the
dining
room
which
like
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
was
exceedingly
lofty
the
members
of
the
household
and
the
footmen
one
behind
each
chair
stood
waiting
for
the
prince
to
enter
the
head
butler
napkin
on
arm
was
scanning
the
setting
of
the
table
making
signs
to
the
footmen
and
anxiously
glancing
from
the
clock
to
the
door
by
which
the
prince
was
to
enter
prince
andrew
was
looking
at
a
large
gilt
frame
new
to
him
containing
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
princes
bolkonski
opposite
which
hung
another
such
frame
with
a
badly
painted
portrait
evidently
by
the
hand
of
the
artist
belonging
to
the
estate
of
a
ruling
prince
in
a
crown
an
alleged
descendant
of
rurik
and
ancestor
of
the
bolkonskis
prince
andrew
looking
again
at
that
genealogical
tree
shook
his
head
laughing
as
a
man
laughs
who
looks
at
a
portrait
so
characteristic
of
the
original
as
to
be
amusing
how
thoroughly
like
him
that
is
he
said
to
princess
mary
who
had
come
up
to
him
princess
mary
looked
at
her
brother
in
surprise
she
did
not
understand
what
he
was
laughing
at
everything
her
father
did
inspired
her
with
reverence
and
was
beyond
question
everyone
has
his
achilles
heel
continued
prince
andrew
fancy
with
his
powerful
mind
indulging
in
such
nonsense
princess
mary
could
not
understand
the
boldness
of
her
brother
s
criticism
and
was
about
to
reply
when
the
expected
footsteps
were
heard
coming
from
the
study
the
prince
walked
in
quickly
and
jauntily
as
was
his
wont
as
if
intentionally
contrasting
the
briskness
of
his
manners
with
the
strict
formality
of
his
house
at
that
moment
the
great
clock
struck
two
and
another
with
a
shrill
tone
joined
in
from
the
drawing
room
the
prince
stood
still
his
lively
glittering
eyes
from
under
their
thick
bushy
eyebrows
sternly
scanned
all
present
and
rested
on
the
little
princess
she
felt
as
courtiers
do
when
the
tsar
enters
the
sensation
of
fear
and
respect
which
the
old
man
inspired
in
all
around
him
he
stroked
her
hair
and
then
patted
her
awkwardly
on
the
back
of
her
neck
i
m
glad
glad
to
see
you
he
said
looking
attentively
into
her
eyes
and
then
quickly
went
to
his
place
and
sat
down
sit

michael
ivanovich
he
indicated
a
place
beside
him
to
his
daughter
in
law
a
footman
moved
the
chair
for
her
ho
ho
said
the
old
man
casting
his
eyes
on
her
rounded
figure
you
ve
been
in
a
hurry
that
s
bad
he
laughed
in
his
usual
dry
cold
unpleasant
way
with
his
lips
only
and
not
with
his
eyes
you
must
walk
walk
as
much
as
possible
as
much
as
possible
he
said
the
little
princess
did
not
or
did
not
wish
to
hear
his
words
she
was
silent
and
seemed
confused
the
prince
asked
her
about
her
father
and
she
began
to
smile
and
talk
he
asked
about
mutual
acquaintances
and
she
became
still
more
animated
and
chattered
away
giving
him
greetings
from
various
people
and
retelling
the
town
gossip
countess
apraksina
poor
thing
has
lost
her
husband
and
she
has
cried
her
eyes
out

said

more
and
more
lively
as
she
became
animated
the
prince
looked
at
her
more
and
more
sternly
and
suddenly
as
if
he
had
studied
her
sufficiently
and
had
formed
a
definite
idea
of
her
he
turned
away
and
addressed
michael
ivanovich
well
michael
ivanovich
our
bonaparte
will
be
having
a
bad
time
of
it
prince
andrew
he
always
spoke
thus
of
his
son
has
been
telling
me
what
forces
are
being
collected
against
him
while
you
and
i
never
thought
much
of
him
michael
ivanovich
did
not
at
all
know
when
you
and
i
had
said
such
things
about
bonaparte
but
understanding
that
he
was
wanted
as
a
peg
on
which
to
hang
the
prince
s
favorite
topic
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
young
prince
wondering
what
would
follow
he
is
a
great
tactician
said
the
prince
to
his
son
pointing
to
the
architect
and
the
conversation
again
turned
on
the
war
on
bonaparte
and
the
generals
and
statesmen
of
the
day
the
old
prince
seemed
convinced
not
only
that
all
the
men
of
the
day
were
mere
babies
who
did
not
know
the
a
b
c
of
war
or
of
politics
and
that
bonaparte
was
an
insignificant
little
frenchy
successful
only
because
there
were
no
longer
any
potemkins
or
suvorovs
left
to
oppose
him
but
he
was
also
convinced
that
there
were
no
political
difficulties
in
europe
and
no
real
war
but
only
a
sort
of
puppet
show
at
which
the
men
of
the
day
were
playing
pretending
to
do
something
real
prince
andrew
gaily
bore
with
his
father
s
ridicule
of
the
new
men
and
drew
him
on
and
listened
to
him
with
evident
pleasure
the
past
always
seems
good
said
he
but
did
not
suvorov
himself
fall
into
a
trap
moreau
set
him
and
from
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
escape
who
told
you
that
who
cried
the
prince
suvorov
and
he
jerked
away
his
plate
which
tikhon
briskly
caught
suvorov
consider
prince
andrew
two
frederick
and
suvorov
moreau
moreau
would
have
been
a
prisoner
if
suvorov
had
had
a
free
hand
but
he
had
the
hofs
kriegs
wurst
schnapps
rath
on
his
hands
it
would
have
puzzled
the
devil
himself
when
you
get
there
you
ll
find
out
what
those
hofs
kriegs
wurst
raths
are
suvorov
couldn
t
manage
them
so
what
chance
has
michael
kutuzov
no
my
dear
boy
he
continued
you
and
your
generals
won
t
get
on
against
buonaparte
you
ll
have
to
call
in
the
french
so
that
birds
of
a
feather
may
fight
together
the
german
pahlen
has
been
sent
to
new
york
in
america
to
fetch
the
frenchman
moreau
he
said
alluding
to
the
invitation
made
that
year
to
moreau
to
enter
the
russian
service
wonderful
were
the
potemkins
suvorovs
and
orlovs
germans
no
lad
either
you
fellows
have
all
lost
your
wits
or
i
have
outlived
mine
may
god
help
you
but
we
ll
see
what
will
happen
buonaparte
has
become
a
great
commander
among
them
hm
i
don
t
at
all
say
that
all
the
plans
are
good
said
prince
andrew
i
am
only
surprised
at
your
opinion
of
bonaparte
you
may
laugh
as
much
as
you
like
but
all
the
same
bonaparte
is
a
great
general
michael
ivanovich
cried
the
old
prince
to
the
architect
who
busy
with
his
roast
meat
hoped
he
had
been
forgotten
didn
t
i
tell
you
buonaparte
was
a
great
tactician
here
he
says
the
same
thing
to
be
sure
your
excellency
replied
the
architect
the
prince
again
laughed
his
frigid
laugh
buonaparte
was
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
his
mouth
he
has
got
splendid
soldiers
besides
he
began
by
attacking
germans
and
only
idlers
have
failed
to
beat
the
germans
since
the
world
began
everybody
has
beaten
the
germans
they
beat
no
one
except
one
another
he
made
his
reputation
fighting
them
and
the
prince
began
explaining
all
the
blunders
which
according
to
him
bonaparte
had
made
in
his
campaigns
and
even
in
politics
his
son
made
no
rejoinder
but
it
was
evident
that
whatever
arguments
were
presented
he
was
as
little
able
as
his
father
to
change
his
opinion
he
listened
refraining
from
a
reply
and
involuntarily
wondered
how
this
old
man
living
alone
in
the
country
for
so
many
years
could
know
and
discuss
so
minutely
and
acutely
all
the
recent
european
military
and
political
events
you
think
i
m
an
old
man
and
don
t
understand
the
present
state
of
affairs
concluded
his
father
but
it
troubles
me
i
don
t
sleep
at
night
come
now
where
has
this
great
commander
of
yours
shown
his
skill
he
concluded
that
would
take
too
long
to
tell
answered
the
son
well
then
go
off
to
your
buonaparte
mademoiselle
bourienne
here
s
another
admirer
of
that
powder
monkey
emperor
of
yours
he
exclaimed
in
excellent
french
you
know
prince
i
am
not
a
bonapartist
dieu
sait
quand
reviendra
hummed
the
prince
out
of
tune
and
with
a
laugh
still
more
so
he
quitted
the
table
the
little
princess
during
the
whole
discussion
and
the
rest
of
the
dinner
sat
silent
glancing
with
a
frightened
look
now
at
her
father
in
law
and
now
at
princess
mary
when
they
left
the
table
she
took
her
sister
in
law
s
arm
and
drew
her
into
another
room
what
a
clever
man
your
father
is
said
she
perhaps
that
is
why
i
am
afraid
of
him
oh
he
is
so
kind
answered
princess
mary
chapter
xxviii
prince
andrew
was
to
leave
next
evening
the
old
prince
not
altering
his
routine
retired
as
usual
after
dinner
the
little
princess
was
in
her
sister
in
law
s
room
prince
andrew
in
a
traveling
coat
without
epaulettes
had
been
packing
with
his
valet
in
the
rooms
assigned
to
him
after
inspecting
the
carriage
himself
and
seeing
the
trunks
put
in
he
ordered
the
horses
to
be
harnessed
only
those
things
he
always
kept
with
him
remained
in
his
room
a
small
box
a
large
canteen
fitted
with
silver
plate
two
turkish
pistols
and
a
saber
a
present
from
his
father
who
had
brought
it
from
the
siege
of
ochakov
all
these
traveling
effects
of
prince
andrew
s
were
in
very
good
order
new
clean
and
in
cloth
covers
carefully
tied
with
tapes
when
starting
on
a
journey
or
changing
their
mode
of
life
men
capable
of
reflection
are
generally
in
a
serious
frame
of
mind
at
such
moments
one
reviews
the
past
and
plans
for
the
future
prince
andrew
s
face
looked
very
thoughtful
and
tender
with
his
hands
behind
him
he
paced
briskly
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
room
looking
straight
before
him
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
did
he
fear
going
to
the
war
or
was
he
sad
at
leaving
his
wife
perhaps
both
but
evidently
he
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
in
that
mood
for
hearing
footsteps
in
the
passage
he
hurriedly
unclasped
his
hands
stopped
at
a
table
as
if
tying
the
cover
of
the
small
box
and
assumed
his
usual
tranquil
and
impenetrable
expression
it
was
the
heavy
tread
of
princess
mary
that
he
heard
i
hear
you
have
given
orders
to
harness
she
cried
panting
she
had
apparently
been
running
and
i
did
so
wish
to
have
another
talk
with
you
alone
god
knows
how
long
we
may
again
be
parted
you
are
not
angry
with
me
for
coming
you
have
changed
so
andrusha
she
added
as
if
to
explain
such
a
question
she
smiled
as
she
uttered
his
pet
name
andrusha
it
was
obviously
strange
to
her
to
think
that
this
stern
handsome
man
should
be
andrusha
the
slender
mischievous
boy
who
had
been
her
playfellow
in
childhood
and
where
is
lise
he
asked
answering
her
question
only
by
a
smile
she
was
so
tired
that
she
has
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
in
my
room
oh
andrew
what
a
treasure
of
a
wife
you
have
said
she
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
facing
her
brother
she
is
quite
a
child
such
a
dear
merry
child
i
have
grown
so
fond
of
her
prince
andrew
was
silent
but
the
princess
noticed
the
ironical
and
contemptuous
look
that
showed
itself
on
his
face
one
must
be
indulgent
to
little
weaknesses
who
is
free
from
them
andrew
don
t
forget
that
she
has
grown
up
and
been
educated
in
society
and
so
her
position
now
is
not
a
rosy
one
we
should
enter
into
everyone
s
situation
tout
comprendre
c
est
tout
pardonner
think
what
it
must
be
for
her
poor
thing
after
what
she
has
been
used
to
to
be
parted
from
her
husband
and
be
left
alone
in
the
country
in
her
condition
it
s
very
hard
to
understand
all
is
to
forgive
all
prince
andrew
smiled
as
he
looked
at
his
sister
as
we
smile
at
those
we
think
we
thoroughly
understand
you
live
in
the
country
and
don
t
think
the
life
terrible
he
replied
i
that
s
different
why
speak
of
me
i
don
t
want
any
other
life
and
can
t
for
i
know
no
other
but
think
andrew
for
a
young
society
woman
to
be
buried
in
the
country
during
the
best
years
of
her
life
all
alone
for
papa
is
always
busy
and
i
well
you
know
what
poor
resources
i
have
for
entertaining
a
woman
used
to
the
best
society
there
is
only
mademoiselle
bourienne
i
don
t
like
your
mademoiselle
bourienne
at
all
said
prince
andrew
no
she
is
very
nice
and
kind
and
above
all
she
s
much
to
be
pitied
she
has
no
one
no
one
to
tell
the
truth
i
don
t
need
her
and
she
s
even
in
my
way
you
know
i
always
was
a
savage
and
now
am
even
more
so
i
like
being
alone
father
likes
her
very
much
she
and
michael
ivanovich
are
the
two
people
to
whom
he
is
always
gentle
and
kind
because
he
has
been
a
benefactor
to
them
both
as
sterne
says
we
don
t
love
people
so
much
for
the
good
they
have
done
us
as
for
the
good
we
have
done
them
father
took
her
when
she
was
homeless
after
losing
her
own
father
she
is
very
good
natured
and
my
father
likes
her
way
of
reading
she
reads
to
him
in
the
evenings
and
reads
splendidly
to
be
quite
frank
mary
i
expect
father
s
character
sometimes
makes
things
trying
for
you
doesn
t
it
prince
andrew
asked
suddenly
princess
mary
was
first
surprised
and
then
aghast
at
this
question
for
me
for
me
trying
for
me
said
she
he
always
was
rather
harsh
and
now
i
should
think
he
s
getting
very
trying
said
prince
andrew
apparently
speaking
lightly
of
their
father
in
order
to
puzzle
or
test
his
sister
you
are
good
in
every
way
andrew
but
you
have
a
kind
of
intellectual
pride
said
the
princess
following
the
train
of
her
own
thoughts
rather
than
the
trend
of
the
conversation
and
that
s
a
great
sin
how
can
one
judge
father
but
even
if
one
might
what
feeling
except
veneration
could
such
a
man
as
my
father
evoke
and
i
am
so
contented
and
happy
with
him
i
only
wish
you
were
all
as
happy
as
i
am
her
brother
shook
his
head
incredulously
the
only
thing
that
is
hard
for
me
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
andrew
is
father
s
way
of
treating
religious
subjects
i
don
t
understand
how
a
man
of
his
immense
intellect
can
fail
to
see
what
is
as
clear
as
day
and
can
go
so
far
astray
that
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
unhappy
but
even
in
this
i
can
see
lately
a
shade
of
improvement
his
satire
has
been
less
bitter
of
late
and
there
was
a
monk
he
received
and
had
a
long
talk
with
ah
my
dear
i
am
afraid
you
and
your
monk
are
wasting
your
powder
said
prince
andrew
banteringly
yet
tenderly
ah
mon
ami
i
only
pray
and
hope
that
god
will
hear
me
andrew
she
said
timidly
after
a
moment
s
silence
i
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you
what
is
it
dear
no
promise
that
you
will
not
refuse
it
will
give
you
no
trouble
and
is
nothing
unworthy
of
you
but
it
will
comfort
me
promise
andrusha
said
she
putting
her
hand
in
her
reticule
but
not
yet
taking
out
what
she
was
holding
inside
it
as
if
what
she
held
were
the
subject
of
her
request
and
must
not
be
shown
before
the
request
was
granted
she
looked
timidly
at
her
brother
even
if
it
were
a
great
deal
of
trouble
answered
prince
andrew
as
if
guessing
what
it
was
about
think
what
you
please
i
know
you
are
just
like
father
think
as
you
please
but
do
this
for
my
sake
please
do
father
s
father
our
grandfather
wore
it
in
all
his
wars
she
still
did
not
take
out
what
she
was
holding
in
her
reticule
so
you
promise
of
course
what
is
it
andrew
i
bless
you
with
this
icon
and
you
must
promise
me
you
will
never
take
it
off
do
you
promise
if
it
does
not
weigh
a
hundredweight
and
won
t
break
my
neck
to
please
you
said
prince
andrew
but
immediately
noticing
the
pained
expression
his
joke
had
brought
to
his
sister
s
face
he
repented
and
added
i
am
glad
really
dear
i
am
very
glad
against
your
will
he
will
save
and
have
mercy
on
you
and
bring
you
to
himself
for
in
him
alone
is
truth
and
peace
said
she
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
solemnly
holding
up
in
both
hands
before
her
brother
a
small
oval
antique
dark
faced
icon
of
the
saviour
in
a
gold
setting
on
a
finely
wrought
silver
chain
she
crossed
herself
kissed
the
icon
and
handed
it
to
andrew
please
andrew
for
my
sake
rays
of
gentle
light
shone
from
her
large
timid
eyes
those
eyes
lit
up
the
whole
of
her
thin
sickly
face
and
made
it
beautiful
her
brother
would
have
taken
the
icon
but
she
stopped
him
andrew
understood
crossed
himself
and
kissed
the
icon
there
was
a
look
of
tenderness
for
he
was
touched
but
also
a
gleam
of
irony
on
his
face
thank
you
my
dear
she
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
sat
down
again
on
the
sofa
they
were
silent
for
a
while
as
i
was
saying
to
you
andrew
be
kind
and
generous
as
you
always
used
to
be
don
t
judge
lise
harshly
she
began
she
is
so
sweet
so
good
natured
and
her
position
now
is
a
very
hard
one
i
do
not
think
i
have
complained
of
my
wife
to
you
masha
or
blamed
her
why
do
you
say
all
this
to
me
red
patches
appeared
on
princess
mary
s
face
and
she
was
silent
as
if
she
felt
guilty
i
have
said
nothing
to
you
but
you
have
already
been
talked
to
and
i
am
sorry
for
that
he
went
on
the
patches
grew
deeper
on
her
forehead
neck
and
cheeks
she
tried
to
say
something
but
could
not
her
brother
had
guessed
right
the
little
princess
had
been
crying
after
dinner
and
had
spoken
of
her
forebodings
about
her
confinement
and
how
she
dreaded
it
and
had
complained
of
her
fate
her
father
in
law
and
her
husband
after
crying
she
had
fallen
asleep
prince
andrew
felt
sorry
for
his
sister
know
this
masha
i
can
t
reproach
have
not
reproached
and
never
shall
reproach
my
wife
with
anything
and
i
cannot
reproach
myself
with
anything
in
regard
to
her
and
that
always
will
be
so
in
whatever
circumstances
i
may
be
placed
but
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
if
you
want
to
know
whether
i
am
happy
no
is
she
happy
no
but
why
this
is
so
i
don
t
know
as
he
said
this
he
rose
went
to
his
sister
and
stooping
kissed
her
forehead
his
fine
eyes
lit
up
with
a
thoughtful
kindly
and
unaccustomed
brightness
but
he
was
looking
not
at
his
sister
but
over
her
head
toward
the
darkness
of
the
open
doorway
let
us
go
to
her
i
must
say
good
by
or
go
and
wake
and
i
ll
come
in
a
moment
petrushka
he
called
to
his
valet
come
here
take
these
away
put
this
on
the
seat
and
this
to
the
right
princess
mary
rose
and
moved
to
the
door
then
stopped
and
said
andrew
if
you
had
faith
you
would
have
turned
to
god
and
asked
him
to
give
you
the
love
you
do
not
feel
and
your
prayer
would
have
been
answered
well
maybe
said
prince
andrew
go
masha
i
ll
come
immediately
on
the
way
to
his
sister
s
room
in
the
passage
which
connected
one
wing
with
the
other
prince
andrew
met
mademoiselle
bourienne
smiling
sweetly
it
was
the
third
time
that
day
that
with
an
ecstatic
and
artless
smile
she
had
met
him
in
secluded
passages
oh
i
thought
you
were
in
your
room
she
said
for
some
reason
blushing
and
dropping
her
eyes
prince
andrew
looked
sternly
at
her
and
an
expression
of
anger
suddenly
came
over
his
face
he
said
nothing
to
her
but
looked
at
her
forehead
and
hair
without
looking
at
her
eyes
with
such
contempt
that
the
frenchwoman
blushed
and
went
away
without
a
word
when
he
reached
his
sister
s
room
his
wife
was
already
awake
and
her
merry
voice
hurrying
one
word
after
another
came
through
the
open
door
she
was
speaking
as
usual
in
french
and
as
if
after
long
self
restraint
she
wished
to
make
up
for
lost
time
no
but
imagine
the
old
countess
zubova
with
false
curls
and
her
mouth
full
of
false
teeth
as
if
she
were
trying
to
cheat
old
age
ha
ha
ha
mary
this
very
sentence
about
countess
zubova
and
this
same
laugh
prince
andrew
had
already
heard
from
his
wife
in
the
presence
of
others
some
five
times
he
entered
the
room
softly
the
little
princess
plump
and
rosy
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
with
her
work
in
her
hands
talking
incessantly
repeating
petersburg
reminiscences
and
even
phrases
prince
andrew
came
up
stroked
her
hair
and
asked
if
she
felt
rested
after
their
journey
she
answered
him
and
continued
her
chatter
the
coach
with
six
horses
was
waiting
at
the
porch
it
was
an
autumn
night
so
dark
that
the
coachman
could
not
see
the
carriage
pole
servants
with
lanterns
were
bustling
about
in
the
porch
the
immense
house
was
brilliant
with
lights
shining
through
its
lofty
windows
the
domestic
serfs
were
crowding
in
the
hall
waiting
to
bid
good
by
to
the
young
prince
the
members
of
the
household
were
all
gathered
in
the
reception
hall
michael
ivanovich
mademoiselle
bourienne
princess
mary
and
the
little
princess
prince
andrew
had
been
called
to
his
father
s
study
as
the
latter
wished
to
say
good
by
to
him
alone
all
were
waiting
for
them
to
come
out
when
prince
andrew
entered
the
study
the
old
man
in
his
old
age
spectacles
and
white
dressing
gown
in
which
he
received
no
one
but
his
son
sat
at
the
table
writing
he
glanced
round
going
and
he
went
on
writing
i
ve
come
to
say
good
by
kiss
me
here
and
he
touched
his
cheek
thanks
thanks
what
do
you
thank
me
for
for
not
dilly
dallying
and
not
hanging
to
a
woman
s
apron
strings
the
service
before
everything
thanks
thanks
and
he
went
on
writing
so
that
his
quill
spluttered
and
squeaked
if
you
have
anything
to
say
say
it
these
two
things
can
be
done
together
he
added
about
my
wife
i
am
ashamed
as
it
is
to
leave
her
on
your
hands
why
talk
nonsense
say
what
you
want
when
her
confinement
is
due
send
to
moscow
for
an
accoucheur
let
him
be
here
the
old
prince
stopped
writing
and
as
if
not
understanding
fixed
his
stern
eyes
on
his
son
i
know
that
no
one
can
help
if
nature
does
not
do
her
work
said
prince
andrew
evidently
confused
i
know
that
out
of
a
million
cases
only
one
goes
wrong
but
it
is
her
fancy
and
mine
they
have
been
telling
her
things
she
has
had
a
dream
and
is
frightened
hm
hm
muttered
the
old
prince
to
himself
finishing
what
he
was
writing
i
ll
do
it
he
signed
with
a
flourish
and
suddenly
turning
to
his
son
began
to
laugh
it
s
a
bad
business
eh
what
is
bad
father
the
wife
said
the
old
prince
briefly
and
significantly
i
don
t
understand
said
prince
andrew
no
it
can
t
be
helped
lad
said
the
prince
they
re
all
like
that
one
can
t
unmarry
don
t
be
afraid
i
won
t
tell
anyone
but
you
know
it
yourself
he
seized
his
son
by
the
hand
with
small
bony
fingers
shook
it
looked
straight
into
his
son
s
face
with
keen
eyes
which
seemed
to
see
through
him
and
again
laughed
his
frigid
laugh
the
son
sighed
thus
admitting
that
his
father
had
understood
him
the
old
man
continued
to
fold
and
seal
his
letter
snatching
up
and
throwing
down
the
wax
the
seal
and
the
paper
with
his
accustomed
rapidity
what
s
to
be
done
she
s
pretty
i
will
do
everything
make
your
mind
easy
said
he
in
abrupt
sentences
while
sealing
his
letter
andrew
did
not
speak
he
was
both
pleased
and
displeased
that
his
father
understood
him
the
old
man
got
up
and
gave
the
letter
to
his
son
listen
said
he
don
t
worry
about
your
wife

can
be
done

letter

ilarionovich

nicholas
bolkonski

son

if
he
is
in
disfavor
now
come
here
kutuzov
he
spoke
so
rapidly
that
he
did
not
finish
half
his
words
but
his
son
was
accustomed
to
understand
him
he
led
him
to
the
desk
raised
the
lid
drew
out
a
drawer
and
took
out
an
exercise
book
filled
with
his
bold
tall
close
handwriting
i
shall
probably
die
before
you
so
remember
these
are
my
memoirs
hand
them
to
the
emperor
after
my
death

a
lombard

letter

premium

the
man

history

wars

it
to
the
academy
here
are
some
jottings
for
you
to
read
when
i
am
gone
you
will
find
them
useful
andrew
did
not
tell
his
father
that
he
would
no
doubt
live
a
long
time
yet
he
felt
that
he
must
not
say
it
i
will
do
it
all
father
he
said
well
now
good
by
he
gave
his
son
his
hand
to
kiss
and
embraced
him
remember
this
prince
andrew
if
they
kill
you
it
will
hurt
me
your
old
father
he
paused
unexpectedly
and
then
in
a
querulous
voice
suddenly
shrieked
but
if
i
hear
that
you
have
not
behaved
like
a
son
of
nicholas
bolkonski
i
shall
be
ashamed
you
need
not
have
said
that
to
me
father
said
the
son
with
a
smile
the
old
man
was
silent
i
also
wanted
to
ask
you
continued
prince
andrew
if
i
m
killed
and
if
i
have
a
son
do
not
let
him
be
taken
away
from
you
as
i
said
yesterday
let
him
grow
up
with
you
please
not
let
the
wife
have
him
said
the
old
man
and
laughed
they
stood
silent
facing
one
another
the
old
man
s
sharp
eyes
were
fixed
straight
on
his
son
s
something
twitched
in
the
lower
part
of
the
old
prince
s
face
we
ve
said
good
by
go
he
suddenly
shouted
in
a
loud
angry
voice
opening
his
door
what
is
it
what
asked
both
princesses
when
they
saw
for
a
moment
at
the
door
prince
andrew
and
the
figure
of
the
old
man
in
a
white
dressing
gown
spectacled
and
wigless
shouting
in
an
angry
voice
prince
andrew
sighed
and
made
no
reply
well
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
and
this
well
sounded
coldly
ironic
as
if
he
were
saying
now
go
through
your
performance
andrew
already
said
the
little
princess
turning
pale
and
looking
with
dismay
at
her
husband
he
embraced
her
she
screamed
and
fell
unconscious
on
his
shoulder
he
cautiously
released
the
shoulder
she
leaned
on
looked
into
her
face
and
carefully
placed
her
in
an
easy
chair
adieu
mary
said
he
gently
to
his
sister
taking
her
by
the
hand
and
kissing
her
and
then
he
left
the
room
with
rapid
steps
the
little
princess
lay
in
the
armchair
mademoiselle
bourienne
chafing
her
temples
princess
mary
supporting
her
sister
in
law
still
looked
with
her
beautiful
eyes
full
of
tears
at
the
door
through
which
prince
andrew
had
gone
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
his
direction
from
the
study
like
pistol
shots
came
the
frequent
sound
of
the
old
man
angrily
blowing
his
nose
hardly
had
prince
andrew
gone
when
the
study
door
opened
quickly
and
the
stern
figure
of
the
old
man
in
the
white
dressing
gown
looked
out
gone
that
s
all
right
said
he
and
looking
angrily
at
the
unconscious
little
princess
he
shook
his
head
reprovingly
and
slammed
the
door
book
two
chapter
i
in
october
a
russian
army
was
occupying
the
villages
and
towns
of
the
archduchy
of
austria
and
yet
other
regiments
freshly
arriving
from
russia
were
settling
near
the
fortress
of
braunau
and
burdening
the
inhabitants
on
whom
they
were
quartered
braunau
was
the
headquarters
of
the
commander
in
chief
kutuzov
on
october
one
of
the
infantry
regiments
that
had
just
reached
braunau
had
halted
half
a
mile
from
the
town
waiting
to
be
inspected
by
the
commander
in
chief
despite
the
un
russian
appearance
of
the
locality
and
surroundings
fruit
gardens
stone
fences
tiled
roofs
and
hills
in
the
distance
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
inhabitants
who
gazed
with
curiosity
at
the
soldiers
were
not
russians
the
regiment
had
just
the
appearance
of
any
russian
regiment
preparing
for
an
inspection
anywhere
in
the
heart
of
russia
on
the
evening
of
the
last
day
s
march
an
order
had
been
received
that
the
commander
in
chief
would
inspect
the
regiment
on
the
march
though
the
words
of
the
order
were
not
clear
to
the
regimental
commander
and
the
question
arose
whether
the
troops
were
to
be
in
marching
order
or
not
it
was
decided
at
a
consultation
between
the
battalion
commanders
to
present
the
regiment
in
parade
order
on
the
principle
that
it
is
always
better
to
bow
too
low
than
not
bow
low
enough
so
the
soldiers
after
a
twenty
mile
march
were
kept
mending
and
cleaning
all
night
long
without
closing
their
eyes
while
the
adjutants
and
company
commanders
calculated
and
reckoned
and
by
morning
the
regiment
instead
of
the
straggling
disorderly
crowd
it
had
been
on
its
last
march
the
day
before
presented
a
well
ordered
array
of
two
thousand
men
each
of
whom
knew
his
place
and
his
duty
had
every
button
and
every
strap
in
place
and
shone
with
cleanliness
and
not
only
externally
was
all
in
order
but
had
it
pleased
the
commander
in
chief
to
look
under
the
uniforms
he
would
have
found
on
every
man
a
clean
shirt
and
in
every
knapsack
the
appointed
number
of
articles
awl
soap
and
all
as
the
soldiers
say
there
was
only
one
circumstance
concerning
which
no
one
could
be
at
ease
it
was
the
state
of
the
soldiers
boots
more
than
half
the
men
s
boots
were
in
holes
but
this
defect
was
not
due
to
any
fault
of
the
regimental
commander
for
in
spite
of
repeated
demands
boots
had
not
been
issued
by
the
austrian
commissariat
and
the
regiment
had
marched
some
seven
hundred
miles
the
commander
of
the
regiment
was
an
elderly
choleric
stout
and
thick
set
general
with
grizzled
eyebrows
and
whiskers
and
wider
from
chest
to
back
than
across
the
shoulders
he
had
on
a
brand
new
uniform
showing
the
creases
where
it
had
been
folded
and
thick
gold
epaulettes
which
seemed
to
stand
rather
than
lie
down
on
his
massive
shoulders
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
happily
performing
one
of
the
most
solemn
duties
of
his
life
he
walked
about
in
front
of
the
line
and
at
every
step
pulled
himself
up
slightly
arching
his
back
it
was
plain
that
the
commander
admired
his
regiment
rejoiced
in
it
and
that
his
whole
mind
was
engrossed
by
it
yet
his
strut
seemed
to
indicate
that
besides
military
matters
social
interests
and
the
fair
sex
occupied
no
small
part
of
his
thoughts
well
michael
mitrich
sir
he
said
addressing
one
of
the
battalion
commanders
who
smilingly
pressed
forward
it
was
plain
that
they
both
felt
happy
we
had
our
hands
full
last
night
however
i
think
the
regiment
is
not
a
bad
one
eh
the
battalion
commander
perceived
the
jovial
irony
and
laughed
it
would
not
be
turned
off
the
field
even
on
the
tsaritsin
meadow
what
asked
the
commander
at
that
moment
on
the
road
from
the
town
on
which
signalers
had
been
posted
two
men
appeared
on
horse
back
they
were
an
aide
de
camp
followed
by
a
cossack
the
aide
de
camp
was
sent
to
confirm
the
order
which
had
not
been
clearly
worded
the
day
before
namely
that
the
commander
in
chief
wished
to
see
the
regiment
just
in
the
state
in
which
it
had
been
on
the
march
in
their
greatcoats
and
packs
and
without
any
preparation
whatever
a
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
from
vienna
had
come
to
kutuzov
the
day
before
with
proposals
and
demands
for
him
to
join
up
with
the
army
of
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
mack
and
kutuzov
not
considering
this
junction
advisable
meant
among
other
arguments
in
support
of
his
view
to
show
the
austrian
general
the
wretched
state
in
which
the
troops
arrived
from
russia
with
this
object
he
intended
to
meet
the
regiment
so
the
worse
the
condition
it
was
in
the
better
pleased
the
commander
in
chief
would
be
though
the
aide
de
camp
did
not
know
these
circumstances
he
nevertheless
delivered
the
definite
order
that
the
men
should
be
in
their
greatcoats
and
in
marching
order
and
that
the
commander
in
chief
would
otherwise
be
dissatisfied
on
hearing
this
the
regimental
commander
hung
his
head
silently
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
arms
with
a
choleric
gesture
a
fine
mess
we
ve
made
of
it
he
remarked
there
now
didn
t
i
tell
you
michael
mitrich
that
if
it
was
said
on
the
march
it
meant
in
greatcoats
said
he
reproachfully
to
the
battalion
commander
oh
my
god
he
added
stepping
resolutely
forward
company
commanders
he
shouted
in
a
voice
accustomed
to
command
sergeants
major
how
soon
will
he
be
here
he
asked
the
aide
de
camp
with
a
respectful
politeness
evidently
relating
to
the
personage
he
was
referring
to
in
an
hour
s
time
i
should
say
shall
we
have
time
to
change
clothes
i
don
t
know
general
the
regimental
commander
going
up
to
the
line
himself
ordered
the
soldiers
to
change
into
their
greatcoats
the
company
commanders
ran
off
to
their
companies
the
sergeants
major
began
bustling
the
greatcoats
were
not
in
very
good
condition
and
instantly
the
squares
that
had
up
to
then
been
in
regular
order
and
silent
began
to
sway
and
stretch
and
hum
with
voices
on
all
sides
soldiers
were
running
to
and
fro
throwing
up
their
knapsacks
with
a
jerk
of
their
shoulders
and
pulling
the
straps
over
their
heads
unstrapping
their
overcoats
and
drawing
the
sleeves
on
with
upraised
arms
in
half
an
hour
all
was
again
in
order
only
the
squares
had
become
gray
instead
of
black
the
regimental
commander
walked
with
his
jerky
steps
to
the
front
of
the
regiment
and
examined
it
from
a
distance
whatever
is
this
this
he
shouted
and
stood
still
commander
of
the
third
company
commander
of
the
third
company
wanted
by
the
general
commander
to
the
general
third
company
to
the
commander
the
words
passed
along
the
lines
and
an
adjutant
ran
to
look
for
the
missing
officer
when
the
eager
but
misrepeated
words
had
reached
their
destination
in
a
cry
of
the
general
to
the
third
company
the
missing
officer
appeared
from
behind
his
company
and
though
he
was
a
middle
aged
man
and
not
in
the
habit
of
running
trotted
awkwardly
stumbling
on
his
toes
toward
the
general
the
captain
s
face
showed
the
uneasiness
of
a
schoolboy
who
is
told
to
repeat
a
lesson
he
has
not
learned
spots
appeared
on
his
nose
the
redness
of
which
was
evidently
due
to
intemperance
and
his
mouth
twitched
nervously
the
general
looked
the
captain
up
and
down
as
he
came
up
panting
slackening
his
pace
as
he
approached
you
will
soon
be
dressing
your
men
in
petticoats
what
is
this
shouted
the
regimental
commander
thrusting
forward
his
jaw
and
pointing
at
a
soldier
in
the
ranks
of
the
third
company
in
a
greatcoat
of
bluish
cloth
which
contrasted
with
the
others
what
have
you
been
after
the
commander
in
chief
is
expected
and
you
leave
your
place
eh
i
ll
teach
you
to
dress
the
men
in
fancy
coats
for
a
parade
eh
the
commander
of
the
company
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
superior
pressed
two
fingers
more
and
more
rigidly
to
his
cap
as
if
in
this
pressure
lay
his
only
hope
of
salvation
well
why
don
t
you
speak
whom
have
you
got
there
dressed
up
as
a
hungarian
said
the
commander
with
an
austere
gibe
your
excellency
well
your
excellency
what
your
excellency
but
what
about
your
excellency
nobody
knows
your
excellency
it
s
the
officer
dolokhov
who
has
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
said
the
captain
softly
well
has
he
been
degraded
into
a
field
marshal
or
into
a
soldier
if
a
soldier
he
should
be
dressed
in
regulation
uniform
like
the
others
your
excellency
you
gave
him
leave
yourself
on
the
march
gave
him
leave
leave
that
s
just
like
you
young
men
said
the
regimental
commander
cooling
down
a
little
leave
indeed
one
says
a
word
to
you
and
you
what
he
added
with
renewed
irritation
i
beg
you
to
dress
your
men
decently
and
the
commander
turning
to
look
at
the
adjutant
directed
his
jerky
steps
down
the
line
he
was
evidently
pleased
at
his
own
display
of
anger
and
walking
up
to
the
regiment
wished
to
find
a
further
excuse
for
wrath
having
snapped
at
an
officer
for
an
unpolished
badge
at
another
because
his
line
was
not
straight
he
reached
the
third
company
h
o
o
w
are
you
standing
where
s
your
leg
your
leg
shouted
the
commander
with
a
tone
of
suffering
in
his
voice
while
there
were
still
five
men
between
him
and
dolokhov
with
his
bluish
gray
uniform
dolokhov
slowly
straightened
his
bent
knee
looking
straight
with
his
clear
insolent
eyes
in
the
general
s
face
why
a
blue
coat
off
with
it
sergeant
major
change
his
coat
the
ras
he
did
not
finish
general
i
must
obey
orders
but
i
am
not
bound
to
endure
dolokhov
hurriedly
interrupted
no
talking
in
the
ranks
no
talking
no
talking
not
bound
to
endure
insults
dolokhov
concluded
in
loud
ringing
tones
the
eyes
of
the
general
and
the
soldier
met
the
general
became
silent
angrily
pulling
down
his
tight
scarf
i
request
you
to
have
the
goodness
to
change
your
coat
he
said
as
he
turned
away
chapter
ii
he
s
coming
shouted
the
signaler
at
that
moment
the
regimental
commander
flushing
ran
to
his
horse
seized
the
stirrup
with
trembling
hands
threw
his
body
across
the
saddle
righted
himself
drew
his
saber
and
with
a
happy
and
resolute
countenance
opening
his
mouth
awry
prepared
to
shout
the
regiment
fluttered
like
a
bird
preening
its
plumage
and
became
motionless
att
ention
shouted
the
regimental
commander
in
a
soul
shaking
voice
which
expressed
joy
for
himself
severity
for
the
regiment
and
welcome
for
the
approaching
chief
along
the
broad
country
road
edged
on
both
sides
by
trees
came
a
high
light
blue
viennese
caleche
slightly
creaking
on
its
springs
and
drawn
by
six
horses
at
a
smart
trot
behind
the
caleche
galloped
the
suite
and
a
convoy
of
croats
beside
kutuzov
sat
an
austrian
general
in
a
white
uniform
that
looked
strange
among
the
russian
black
ones
the
caleche
stopped
in
front
of
the
regiment
kutuzov
and
the
austrian
general
were
talking
in
low
voices
and
kutuzov
smiled
slightly
as
treading
heavily
he
stepped
down
from
the
carriage
just
as
if
those
two
thousand
men
breathlessly
gazing
at
him
and
the
regimental
commander
did
not
exist
the
word
of
command
rang
out
and
again
the
regiment
quivered
as
with
a
jingling
sound
it
presented
arms
then
amidst
a
dead
silence
the
feeble
voice
of
the
commander
in
chief
was
heard
the
regiment
roared
health
to
your
ex
len
len
lency
and
again
all
became
silent
at
first
kutuzov
stood
still
while
the
regiment
moved
then
he
and
the
general
in
white
accompanied
by
the
suite
walked
between
the
ranks
from
the
way
the
regimental
commander
saluted
the
commander
in
chief
and
devoured
him
with
his
eyes
drawing
himself
up
obsequiously
and
from
the
way
he
walked
through
the
ranks
behind
the
generals
bending
forward
and
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
jerky
movements
and
from
the
way
he
darted
forward
at
every
word
or
gesture
of
the
commander
in
chief
it
was
evident
that
he
performed
his
duty
as
a
subordinate
with
even
greater
zeal
than
his
duty
as
a
commander
thanks
to
the
strictness
and
assiduity
of
its
commander
the
regiment
in
comparison
with
others
that
had
reached
braunau
at
the
same
time
was
in
splendid
condition
there
were
only
sick
and
stragglers
everything
was
in
good
order
except
the
boots
kutuzov
walked
through
the
ranks
sometimes
stopping
to
say
a
few
friendly
words
to
officers
he
had
known
in
the
turkish
war
sometimes
also
to
the
soldiers
looking
at
their
boots
he
several
times
shook
his
head
sadly
pointing
them
out
to
the
austrian
general
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
was
not
blaming
anyone
but
could
not
help
noticing
what
a
bad
state
of
things
it
was
the
regimental
commander
ran
forward
on
each
such
occasion
fearing
to
miss
a
single
word
of
the
commander
in
chief
s
regarding
the
regiment
behind
kutuzov
at
a
distance
that
allowed
every
softly
spoken
word
to
be
heard
followed
some
twenty
men
of
his
suite
these
gentlemen
talked
among
themselves
and
sometimes
laughed
nearest
of
all
to
the
commander
in
chief
walked
a
handsome
adjutant
this
was
prince
bolkonski
beside
him
was
his
comrade
nesvitski
a
tall
staff
officer
extremely
stout
with
a
kindly
smiling
handsome
face
and
moist
eyes
nesvitski
could
hardly
keep
from
laughter
provoked
by
a
swarthy
hussar
officer
who
walked
beside
him
this
hussar
with
a
grave
face
and
without
a
smile
or
a
change
in
the
expression
of
his
fixed
eyes
watched
the
regimental
commander
s
back
and
mimicked
his
every
movement
each
time
the
commander
started
and
bent
forward
the
hussar
started
and
bent
forward
in
exactly
the
same
manner
nesvitski
laughed
and
nudged
the
others
to
make
them
look
at
the
wag
kutuzov
walked
slowly
and
languidly
past
thousands
of
eyes
which
were
starting
from
their
sockets
to
watch
their
chief
on
reaching
the
third
company
he
suddenly
stopped
his
suite
not
having
expected
this
involuntarily
came
closer
to
him
ah
timokhin
said
he
recognizing
the
red
nosed
captain
who
had
been
reprimanded
on
account
of
the
blue
greatcoat
one
would
have
thought
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
stretch
himself
more
than
timokhin
had
done
when
he
was
reprimanded
by
the
regimental
commander
but
now
that
the
commander
in
chief
addressed
him
he
drew
himself
up
to
such
an
extent
that
it
seemed
he
could
not
have
sustained
it
had
the
commander
in
chief
continued
to
look
at
him
and
so
kutuzov
who
evidently
understood
his
case
and
wished
him
nothing
but
good
quickly
turned
away
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flitting
over
his
scarred
and
puffy
face
another
ismail
comrade
said
he
a
brave
officer
are
you
satisfied
with
him
he
asked
the
regimental
commander
and
the
latter
unconscious
that
he
was
being
reflected
in
the
hussar
officer
as
in
a
looking
glass
started
moved
forward
and
answered
highly
satisfied
your
excellency
we
all
have
our
weaknesses
said
kutuzov
smiling
and
walking
away
from
him
he
used
to
have
a
predilection
for
bacchus
the
regimental
commander
was
afraid
he
might
be
blamed
for
this
and
did
not
answer
the
hussar
at
that
moment
noticed
the
face
of
the
red
nosed
captain
and
his
drawn
in
stomach
and
mimicked
his
expression
and
pose
with
such
exactitude
that
nesvitski
could
not
help
laughing
kutuzov
turned
round
the
officer
evidently
had
complete
control
of
his
face
and
while
kutuzov
was
turning
managed
to
make
a
grimace
and
then
assume
a
most
serious
deferential
and
innocent
expression
the
third
company
was
the
last
and
kutuzov
pondered
apparently
trying
to
recollect
something
prince
andrew
stepped
forward
from
among
the
suite
and
said
in
french
you
told
me
to
remind
you
of
the
officer
dolokhov
reduced
to
the
ranks
in
this
regiment
where
is
dolokhov
asked
kutuzov
dolokhov
who
had
already
changed
into
a
soldier
s
gray
greatcoat
did
not
wait
to
be
called
the
shapely
figure
of
the
fair
haired
soldier
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
stepped
forward
from
the
ranks
went
up
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
presented
arms
have
you
a
complaint
to
make
kutuzov
asked
with
a
slight
frown
this
is
dolokhov
said
prince
andrew
ah
said
kutuzov
i
hope
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
do
your
duty
the
emperor
is
gracious
and
i
shan
t
forget
you
if
you
deserve
well
the
clear
blue
eyes
looked
at
the
commander
in
chief
just
as
boldly
as
they
had
looked
at
the
regimental
commander
seeming
by
their
expression
to
tear
open
the
veil
of
convention
that
separates
a
commander
in
chief
so
widely
from
a
private
one
thing
i
ask
of
your
excellency
dolokhov
said
in
his
firm
ringing
deliberate
voice
i
ask
an
opportunity
to
atone
for
my
fault
and
prove
my
devotion
to
his
majesty
the
emperor
and
to
russia
kutuzov
turned
away
the
same
smile
of
the
eyes
with
which
he
had
turned
from
captain
timokhin
again
flitted
over
his
face
he
turned
away
with
a
grimace
as
if
to
say
that
everything
dolokhov
had
said
to
him
and
everything
he
could
say
had
long
been
known
to
him
that
he
was
weary
of
it
and
it
was
not
at
all
what
he
wanted
he
turned
away
and
went
to
the
carriage
the
regiment
broke
up
into
companies
which
went
to
their
appointed
quarters
near
braunau
where
they
hoped
to
receive
boots
and
clothes
and
to
rest
after
their
hard
marches
you
won
t
bear
me
a
grudge
prokhor
ignatych
said
the
regimental
commander
overtaking
the
third
company
on
its
way
to
its
quarters
and
riding
up
to
captain
timokhin
who
was
walking
in
front
the
regimental
commander
s
face
now
that
the
inspection
was
happily
over
beamed
with
irrepressible
delight
it
s
in
the
emperor
s
service
it
can
t
be
helped
one
is
sometimes
a
bit
hasty
on
parade
i
am
the
first
to
apologize
you
know
me
he
was
very
pleased
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
captain
don
t
mention
it
general
as
if
i
d
be
so
bold
replied
the
captain
his
nose
growing
redder
as
he
gave
a
smile
which
showed
where
two
front
teeth
were
missing
that
had
been
knocked
out
by
the
butt
end
of
a
gun
at
ismail
and
tell
mr
dolokhov
that
i
won
t
forget
him
he
may
be
quite
easy
and
tell
me
please
i
ve
been
meaning
to
ask
how
is
he
behaving
himself
and
in
general
as
far
as
the
service
goes
he
is
quite
punctilious
your
excellency
but
his
character
said
timokhin
and
what
about
his
character
asked
the
regimental
commander
it
s
different
on
different
days
answered
the
captain
one
day
he
is
sensible
well
educated
and
good
natured
and
the
next
he
s
a
wild
beast
in
poland
if
you
please
he
nearly
killed
a
jew
oh
well
well
remarked
the
regimental
commander
still
one
must
have
pity
on
a
young
man
in
misfortune
you
know
he
has
important
connections
well
then
you
just
i
will
your
excellency
said
timokhin
showing
by
his
smile
that
he
understood
his
commander
s
wish
well
of
course
of
course
the
regimental
commander
sought
out
dolokhov
in
the
ranks
and
reining
in
his
horse
said
to
him
after
the
next
affair
epaulettes
dolokhov
looked
round
but
did
not
say
anything
nor
did
the
mocking
smile
on
his
lips
change
well
that
s
all
right
continued
the
regimental
commander
a
cup
of
vodka
for
the
men
from
me
he
added
so
that
the
soldiers
could
hear
i
thank
you
all
god
be
praised
and
he
rode
past
that
company
and
overtook
the
next
one
well
he
s
really
a
good
fellow
one
can
serve
under
him
said
timokhin
to
the
subaltern
beside
him
in
a
word
a
hearty
one
said
the
subaltern
laughing
the
regimental
commander
was
nicknamed
king
of
hearts
the
cheerful
mood
of
their
officers
after
the
inspection
infected
the
soldiers
the
company
marched
on
gaily
the
soldiers
voices
could
be
heard
on
every
side
and
they
said
kutuzov
was
blind
of
one
eye
and
so
he
is
quite
blind
no
friend
he
is
sharper
eyed
than
you
are
boots
and
leg
bands
he
noticed
everything
when
he
looked
at
my
feet
friend
well
thinks
i
and
that
other
one
with
him
the
austrian
looked
as
if
he
were
smeared
with
chalk
as
white
as
flour
i
suppose
they
polish
him
up
as
they
do
the
guns
i
say
fedeshon
did
he
say
when
the
battles
are
to
begin
you
were
near
him
everybody
said
that
buonaparte
himself
was
at
braunau
buonaparte
himself
just
listen
to
the
fool
what
he
doesn
t
know
the
prussians
are
up
in
arms
now
the
austrians
you
see
are
putting
them
down
when
they
ve
been
put
down
the
war
with
buonaparte

begin
and
he
says
buonaparte
is
in
braunau
shows
you
re
a
fool
you
d
better
listen
more
carefully
what
devils
these
quartermasters
are
see
the
fifth
company
is
turning
into
the
village
already
they
will
have
their
buckwheat
cooked
before

our
quarters

friend
ah
well
never

call
a
halt
here
or
we

to
do
another
four
miles
without
eating
wasn
t
it
fine
when
those
germans
gave
us
lifts
you
just
sit
still
and
are
drawn
along
and
here
friend
the
people
are
quite
beggarly
there
they
all
seemed
to
be
poles
all
under
the
russian
crown
but
here
they
re
all
regular
germans
singers
to
the
front
came
the
captain
s
order
and
from
the
different
ranks
some
twenty
men
ran
to
the
front
a
drummer
their
leader
turned
round
facing
the
singers
and
flourishing
his
arm
began
a
long
drawn
out
soldiers
song
commencing
with
the
words
morning
dawned
the
sun
was
rising
and
concluding
on
then
brothers
on
to
glory
led
by
father
kamenski
this
song
had
been
composed
in
the
turkish
campaign
and
now
being
sung
in
austria
the
only
change
being
that
the
words
father
kamenski
were
replaced
by
father
kutuzov
having
jerked
out
these
last
words
as
soldiers
do
and
waved
his
arms
as
if
flinging
something
to
the
ground
the
drummer
a
lean
handsome
soldier
of
forty
looked
sternly
at
the
singers
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
then
having
satisfied
himself
that
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
he
raised
both
arms
as
if
carefully
lifting
some
invisible
but
precious
object
above
his
head
and
holding
it
there
for
some
seconds
suddenly
flung
it
down
and
began
oh
my
bower
oh
my
bower
oh
my
bower
new
chimed
in
twenty
voices
and
the
castanet
player
in
spite
of
the
burden
of
his
equipment
rushed
out
to
the
front
and
walking
backwards
before
the
company
jerked
his
shoulders
and
flourished
his
castanets
as
if
threatening
someone
the
soldiers
swinging
their
arms
and
keeping
time
spontaneously
marched
with
long
steps
behind
the
company
the
sound
of
wheels
the
creaking
of
springs
and
the
tramp
of
horses
hoofs
were
heard
kutuzov
and
his
suite
were
returning
to
the
town
the
commander
in
chief
made
a
sign
that
the
men
should
continue
to
march
at
ease
and
he
and
all
his
suite
showed
pleasure
at
the
sound
of
the
singing
and
the
sight
of
the
dancing
soldier
and
the
gay
and
smartly
marching
men
in
the
second
file
from
the
right
flank
beside
which
the
carriage
passed
the
company
a
blue
eyed
soldier
involuntarily
attracted
notice
it
was
dolokhov
marching
with
particular
grace
and
boldness
in
time
to
the
song
and
looking
at
those
driving
past
as
if
he
pitied
all
who
were
not
at
that
moment
marching
with
the
company
the
hussar
cornet
of
kutuzov
s
suite
who
had
mimicked
the
regimental
commander
fell
back
from
the
carriage
and
rode
up
to
dolokhov
hussar
cornet
zherkov
had
at
one
time
in
petersburg
belonged
to
the
wild
set
led
by
dolokhov
zherkov
had
met
dolokhov
abroad
as
a
private
and
had
not
seen
fit
to
recognize
him
but
now
that
kutuzov
had
spoken
to
the
gentleman
ranker
he
addressed
him
with
the
cordiality
of
an
old
friend
my
dear
fellow
how
are
you
said
he
through
the
singing
making
his
horse
keep
pace
with
the
company
how
am
i
dolokhov
answered
coldly
i
am
as
you
see
the
lively
song
gave
a
special
flavor
to
the
tone
of
free
and
easy
gaiety
with
which
zherkov
spoke
and
to
the
intentional
coldness
of
dolokhov
s
reply
and
how
do
you
get
on
with
the
officers
inquired
zherkov
all
right
they
are
good
fellows
and
how
have
you
wriggled
onto
the
staff
i
was
attached
i
m
on
duty
both
were
silent
she
let
the
hawk
fly
upward
from
her
wide
right
sleeve
went
the
song
arousing
an
involuntary
sensation
of
courage
and
cheerfulness
their
conversation
would
probably
have
been
different
but
for
the
effect
of
that
song
is
it
true
that
austrians
have
been
beaten
asked
dolokhov
the
devil
only
knows
they
say
so
i
m
glad
answered
dolokhov
briefly
and
clearly
as
the
song
demanded
i
say
come
round
some
evening
and
we
ll
have
a
game
of
faro
said
zherkov
why
have
you
too
much
money
do
come
i
can
t
i
ve
sworn
not
to
i
won
t
drink
and
won
t
play
till
i
get
reinstated
well
that
s
only
till
the
first
engagement
we
shall
see
they
were
again
silent
come
if
you
need
anything
one
can
at
least
be
of
use
on
the
staff
dolokhov
smiled
don
t
trouble
if
i
want
anything
i
won
t
beg
i
ll
take
it
well
never
mind
i
only
and
i
only
good
by
good
health
it
s
a
long
long
way
to
my
native
land
zherkov
touched
his
horse
with
the
spurs
it
pranced
excitedly
from
foot
to
foot
uncertain
with
which
to
start
then
settled
down
galloped
past
the
company
and
overtook
the
carriage
still
keeping
time
to
the
song
chapter
iii
on
returning
from
the
review
kutuzov
took
the
austrian
general
into
his
private
room
and
calling
his
adjutant
asked
for
some
papers
relating
to
the
condition
of
the
troops
on
their
arrival
and
the
letters
that
had
come
from
the
archduke
ferdinand
who
was
in
command
of
the
advanced
army
prince
andrew
bolkonski
came
into
the
room
with
the
required
papers
kutuzov
and
the
austrian
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
were
sitting
at
the
table
on
which
a
plan
was
spread
out
ah
said
kutuzov
glancing
at
bolkonski
as
if
by
this
exclamation
he
was
asking
the
adjutant
to
wait
and
he
went
on
with
the
conversation
in
french
all
i
can
say
general
said
he
with
a
pleasant
elegance
of
expression
and
intonation
that
obliged
one
to
listen
to
each
deliberately
spoken
word
it
was
evident
that
kutuzov
himself
listened
with
pleasure
to
his
own
voice
all
i
can
say
general
is
that
if
the
matter
depended
on
my
personal
wishes
the
will
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
francis
would
have
been
fulfilled
long
ago
i
should
long
ago
have
joined
the
archduke
and
believe
me
on
my
honour
that
to
me
personally
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
hand
over
the
supreme
command
of
the
army
into
the
hands
of
a
better
informed
and
more
skillful
general
of
whom
austria
has
so
many
and
to
lay
down
all
this
heavy
responsibility
but
circumstances
are
sometimes
too
strong
for
us
general
and
kutuzov
smiled
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
say
you
are
quite
at
liberty
not
to
believe
me
and
i
don
t
even
care
whether
you
do
or
not
but
you
have
no
grounds
for
telling
me
so
and
that
is
the
whole
point
the
austrian
general
looked
dissatisfied
but
had
no
option
but
to
reply
in
the
same
tone
on
the
contrary
he
said
in
a
querulous
and
angry
tone
that
contrasted
with
his
flattering
words
on
the
contrary
your
excellency
s
participation
in
the
common
action
is
highly
valued
by
his
majesty
but
we
think
the
present
delay
is
depriving
the
splendid
russian
troops
and
their
commander
of
the
laurels
they
have
been
accustomed
to
win
in
their
battles
he
concluded
his
evidently
prearranged
sentence
kutuzov
bowed
with
the
same
smile
but
that
is
my
conviction
and
judging
by
the
last
letter
with
which
his
highness
the
archduke
ferdinand
has
honored
me
i
imagine
that
the
austrian
troops
under
the
direction
of
so
skillful
a
leader
as
general
mack
have
by
now
already
gained
a
decisive
victory
and
no
longer
need
our
aid
said
kutuzov
the
general
frowned
though
there
was
no
definite
news
of
an
austrian
defeat
there
were
many
circumstances
confirming
the
unfavorable
rumors
that
were
afloat
and
so
kutuzov
s
suggestion
of
an
austrian
victory
sounded
much
like
irony
but
kutuzov
went
on
blandly
smiling
with
the
same
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
had
a
right
to
suppose
so
and
in
fact
the
last
letter
he
had
received
from
mack
s
army
informed
him
of
a
victory
and
stated
strategically
the
position
of
the
army
was
very
favorable
give
me
that
letter
said
kutuzov
turning
to
prince
andrew
please
have
a
look
at
it
and
kutuzov
with
an
ironical
smile
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
read
to
the
austrian
general
the
following
passage
in
german
from
the
archduke
ferdinand
s
letter
we
have
fully
concentrated
forces
of
nearly
seventy
thousand
men
with
which
to
attack
and
defeat
the
enemy
should
he
cross
the
lech
also
as
we
are
masters
of
ulm
we
cannot
be
deprived
of
the
advantage
of
commanding
both
sides
of
the
danube
so
that
should
the
enemy
not
cross
the
lech
we
can
cross
the
danube
throw
ourselves
on
his
line
of
communications
recross
the
river
lower
down
and
frustrate
his
intention
should
he
try
to
direct
his
whole
force
against
our
faithful
ally
we
shall
therefore
confidently
await
the
moment
when
the
imperial
russian
army
will
be
fully
equipped
and
shall
then
in
conjunction
with
it
easily
find
a
way
to
prepare
for
the
enemy
the
fate
he
deserves
kutuzov
sighed
deeply
on
finishing
this
paragraph
and
looked
at
the
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
mildly
and
attentively
but
you
know
the
wise
maxim
your
excellency
advising
one
to
expect
the
worst
said
the
austrian
general
evidently
wishing
to
have
done
with
jests
and
to
come
to
business
he
involuntarily
looked
round
at
the
aide
de
camp
excuse
me
general
interrupted
kutuzov
also
turning
to
prince
andrew
look
here
my
dear
fellow
get
from
kozlovski
all
the
reports
from
our
scouts
here
are
two
letters
from
count
nostitz
and
here
is
one
from
his
highness
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
here
are
these
he
said
handing
him
several
papers
make
a
neat
memorandum
in
french
out
of
all
this
showing
all
the
news
we
have
had
of
the
movements
of
the
austrian
army
and
then
give
it
to
his
excellency
prince
andrew
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
having
understood
from
the
first
not
only
what
had
been
said
but
also
what
kutuzov
would
have
liked
to
tell
him
he
gathered
up
the
papers
and
with
a
bow
to
both
stepped
softly
over
the
carpet
and
went
out
into
the
waiting
room
though
not
much
time
had
passed
since
prince
andrew
had
left
russia
he
had
changed
greatly
during
that
period
in
the
expression
of
his
face
in
his
movements
in
his
walk
scarcely
a
trace
was
left
of
his
former
affected
languor
and
indolence
he
now
looked
like
a
man
who
has
time
to
think
of
the
impression
he
makes
on
others
but
is
occupied
with
agreeable
and
interesting
work
his
face
expressed
more
satisfaction
with
himself
and
those
around
him
his
smile
and
glance
were
brighter
and
more
attractive
kutuzov
whom
he
had
overtaken
in
poland
had
received
him
very
kindly
promised
not
to
forget
him
distinguished
him
above
the
other
adjutants
and
had
taken
him
to
vienna
and
given
him
the
more
serious
commissions
from
vienna
kutuzov
wrote
to
his
old
comrade
prince
andrew
s
father
your
son
bids
fair
to
become
an
officer
distinguished
by
his
industry
firmness
and
expedition
i
consider
myself
fortunate
to
have
such
a
subordinate
by
me
on
kutuzov
s
staff
among
his
fellow
officers
and
in
the
army
generally
prince
andrew
had
as
he
had
had
in
petersburg
society
two
quite
opposite
reputations
some
a
minority
acknowledged
him
to
be
different
from
themselves
and
from
everyone
else
expected
great
things
of
him
listened
to
him
admired
and
imitated
him
and
with
them
prince
andrew
was
natural
and
pleasant
others
the
majority
disliked
him
and
considered
him
conceited
cold
and
disagreeable
but
among
these
people
prince
andrew
knew
how
to
take
his
stand
so
that
they
respected
and
even
feared
him
coming
out
of
kutuzov
s
room
into
the
waiting
room
with
the
papers
in
his
hand
prince
andrew
came
up
to
his
comrade
the
aide
de
camp
on
duty
kozlovski
who
was
sitting
at
the
window
with
a
book
well
prince
asked
kozlovski
i
am
ordered
to
write
a
memorandum
explaining
why
we
are
not
advancing
and
why
is
it
prince
andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
any
news
from
mack
no
if
it
were
true
that
he
has
been
beaten
news
would
have
come
probably
said
prince
andrew
moving
toward
the
outer
door
but
at
that
instant
a
tall
austrian
general
in
a
greatcoat
with
the
order
of
maria
theresa
on
his
neck
and
a
black
bandage
round
his
head
who
had
evidently
just
arrived
entered
quickly
slamming
the
door
prince
andrew
stopped
short
commander
in
chief
kutuzov
said
the
newly
arrived
general
speaking
quickly
with
a
harsh
german
accent
looking
to
both
sides
and
advancing
straight
toward
the
inner
door
the
commander
in
chief
is
engaged
said
kozlovski
going
hurriedly
up
to
the
unknown
general
and
blocking
his
way
to
the
door
whom
shall
i
announce
the
unknown
general
looked
disdainfully
down
at
kozlovski
who
was
rather
short
as
if
surprised
that
anyone
should
not
know
him
the
commander
in
chief
is
engaged
repeated
kozlovski
calmly
the
general
s
face
clouded
his
lips
quivered
and
trembled
he
took
out
a
notebook
hurriedly
scribbled
something
in
pencil
tore
out
the
leaf
gave
it
to
kozlovski
stepped
quickly
to
the
window
and
threw
himself
into
a
chair
gazing
at
those
in
the
room
as
if
asking
why
do
they
look
at
me
then
he
lifted
his
head
stretched
his
neck
as
if
he
intended
to
say
something
but
immediately
with
affected
indifference
began
to
hum
to
himself
producing
a
queer
sound
which
immediately
broke
off
the
door
of
the
private
room
opened
and
kutuzov
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
general
with
the
bandaged
head
bent
forward
as
though
running
away
from
some
danger
and
making
long
quick
strides
with
his
thin
legs
went
up
to
kutuzov
vous
voyez
le
malheureux
mack
he
uttered
in
a
broken
voice
kutuzov
s
face
as
he
stood
in
the
open
doorway
remained
perfectly
immobile
for
a
few
moments
then
wrinkles
ran
over
his
face
like
a
wave
and
his
forehead
became
smooth
again
he
bowed
his
head
respectfully
closed
his
eyes
silently
let
mack
enter
his
room
before
him
and
closed
the
door
himself
behind
him
the
report
which
had
been
circulated
that
the
austrians
had
been
beaten
and
that
the
whole
army
had
surrendered
at
ulm
proved
to
be
correct
within
half
an
hour
adjutants
had
been
sent
in
various
directions
with
orders
which
showed
that
the
russian
troops
who
had
hitherto
been
inactive
would
also
soon
have
to
meet
the
enemy
prince
andrew
was
one
of
those
rare
staff
officers
whose
chief
interest
lay
in
the
general
progress
of
the
war
when
he
saw
mack
and
heard
the
details
of
his
disaster
he
understood
that
half
the
campaign
was
lost
understood
all
the
difficulties
of
the
russian
army
s
position
and
vividly
imagined
what
awaited
it
and
the
part
he
would
have
to
play
involuntarily
he
felt
a
joyful
agitation
at
the
thought
of
the
humiliation
of
arrogant
austria
and
that
in
a
week
s
time
he
might
perhaps
see
and
take
part
in
the
first
russian
encounter
with
the
french
since
suvorov
met
them
he
feared
that
bonaparte
s
genius
might
outweigh
all
the
courage
of
the
russian
troops
and
at
the
same
time
could
not
admit
the
idea
of
his
hero
being
disgraced
excited
and
irritated
by
these
thoughts
prince
andrew
went
toward
his
room
to
write
to
his
father
to
whom
he
wrote
every
day
in
the
corridor
he
met
nesvitski
with
whom
he
shared
a
room
and
the
wag
zherkov
they
were
as
usual
laughing
why
are
you
so
glum
asked
nesvitski
noticing
prince
andrew
s
pale
face
and
glittering
eyes
there
s
nothing
to
be
gay
about
answered
bolkonski
just
as
prince
andrew
met
nesvitski
and
zherkov
there
came
toward
them
from
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
strauch
an
austrian
general
who
on
kutuzov
s
staff
in
charge
of
the
provisioning
of
the
russian
army
and
the
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
who
had
arrived
the
previous
evening
there
was
room
enough
in
the
wide
corridor
for
the
generals
to
pass
the
three
officers
quite
easily
but
zherkov
pushing
nesvitski
aside
with
his
arm
said
in
a
breathless
voice
they
re
coming
they
re
coming
stand
aside
make
way
please
make
way
the
generals
were
passing
by
looking
as
if
they
wished
to
avoid
embarrassing
attentions
on
the
face
of
the
wag
zherkov
there
suddenly
appeared
a
stupid
smile
of
glee
which
he
seemed
unable
to
suppress
your
excellency
said
he
in
german
stepping
forward
and
addressing
the
austrian
general
i
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
he
bowed
his
head
and
scraped
first
with
one
foot
and
then
with
the
other
awkwardly
like
a
child
at
a
dancing
lesson
the
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
looked
at
him
severely
but
seeing
the
seriousness
of
his
stupid
smile
could
not
but
give
him
a
moment
s
attention
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
showing
that
he
was
listening
i
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
general
mack
has
arrived
quite
well
only
a
little
bruised
just
here
he
added
pointing
with
a
beaming
smile
to
his
head
the
general
frowned
turned
away
and
went
on
gott
wie
naiv
said
he
angrily
after
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
good
god
what
simplicity
nesvitski
with
a
laugh
threw
his
arms
round
prince
andrew
but
bolkonski
turning
still
paler
pushed
him
away
with
an
angry
look
and
turned
to
zherkov
the
nervous
irritation
aroused
by
the
appearance
of
mack
the
news
of
his
defeat
and
the
thought
of
what
lay
before
the
russian
army
found
vent
in
anger
at
zherkov
s
untimely
jest
if
you
sir
choose
to
make
a
buffoon
of
yourself
he
said
sharply
with
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lower
jaw
i
can
t
prevent
your
doing
so
but
i
warn
you
that
if
you
dare
to
play
the
fool
in
my
presence
i
will
teach
you
to
behave
yourself
nesvitski
and
zherkov
were
so
surprised
by
this
outburst
that
they
gazed
at
bolkonski
silently
with
wide
open
eyes
what
s
the
matter
i
only
congratulated
them
said
zherkov
i
am
not
jesting
with
you
please
be
silent
cried
bolkonski
and
taking
nesvitski
s
arm
he
left
zherkov
who
did
not
know
what
to
say
come
what
s
the
matter
old
fellow
said
nesvitski
trying
to
soothe
him
what
s
the
matter
exclaimed
prince
andrew
standing
still
in
his
excitement
don
t
you
understand
that
either
we
are
officers
serving
our
tsar
and
our
country
rejoicing
in
the
successes
and
grieving
at
the
misfortunes
of
our
common
cause
or
we
are
merely
lackeys
who
care
nothing
for
their
master
s
business
quarante

massacres
et
l

detruite
et
vous
trouvez
la
le
mot
pour
rire
he
said
as
if
strengthening
his
views
by
this
french
sentence
c
est
bien
pour
un
garcon
de
rien
comme
cet
individu
dont
vous
avez
fait
un
ami
mais
pas
pour
vous
pas
pour
vous
only
a
hobbledehoy
could
amuse
himself
in
this
way
he
added
in
russian
but
pronouncing
the
word
with
a
french
accent
having
noticed
that
zherkov
could
still
hear
him
forty
thousand
men
massacred
and
the
army
of
our
allies
destroyed
and
you
find
that
a
cause
for
jesting
it
is
all
very
well
for
that
good
for
nothing
fellow
of
whom
you
have
made
a
friend
but
not
for
you
not
for
you
he
waited
a
moment
to
see
whether
the
cornet
would
answer
but
he
turned
and
went
out
of
the
corridor
chapter
iv
the
pavlograd
hussars
were
stationed
two
miles
from
braunau
the
squadron
in
which
nicholas
rostov
served
as
a
cadet
was
quartered
in
the
german
village
of
salzeneck
the
best
quarters
in
the
village
were
assigned
to
cavalry
captain
denisov
the
squadron
commander
known
throughout
the
whole
cavalry
division
as
vaska
denisov
cadet
rostov
ever
since
he
had
overtaken
the
regiment
in
poland
had
lived
with
the
squadron
commander
on
october
the
day
when
all
was
astir
at
headquarters
over
the
news
of
mack
s
defeat
the
camp
life
of
the
officers
of
this
squadron
was
proceeding
as
usual
denisov
who
had
been
losing
at
cards
all
night
had
not
yet
come
home
when
rostov
rode
back
early
in
the
morning
from
a
foraging
expedition
rostov
in
his
cadet
uniform
with
a
jerk
to
his
horse
rode
up
to
the
porch
swung
his
leg
over
the
saddle
with
a
supple
youthful
movement
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
stirrup
as
if
loathe
to
part
from
his
horse
and
at
last
sprang
down
and
called
to
his
orderly
ah
bondarenko
dear
friend
said
he
to
the
hussar
who
rushed
up
headlong
to
the
horse
walk
him
up
and
down
my
dear
fellow
he
continued
with
that
gay
brotherly
cordiality
which
goodhearted
young
people
show
to
everyone
when
they
are
happy
yes
your
excellency
answered
the
ukrainian
gaily
tossing
his
head
mind
walk
him
up
and
down
well
another
hussar
also
rushed
toward
the
horse
but
bondarenko
had
already
thrown
the
reins
of
the
snaffle
bridle
over
the
horse
s
head
it
was
evident
that
the
cadet
was
liberal
with
his
tips
and
that
it
paid
to
serve
him
rostov
patted
the
horse
s
neck
and
then
his
flank
and
lingered
for
a
moment
splendid
what
a
horse
he
will
be
he
thought
with
a
smile
and
holding
up
his
saber
his
spurs
jingling
he
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
his
landlord
who
in
a
waistcoat
and
a
pointed
cap
pitchfork
in
hand
was
clearing
manure
from
the
cowhouse
looked
out
and
his
face
immediately
brightened
on
seeing
rostov
schon
gut
morgen
schon
gut
morgen
he
said
winking
with
a
merry
smile
evidently
pleased
to
greet
the
young
man
a
very
good
morning
a
very
good
morning
schon
fleissig
said
rostov
with
the
same
gay
brotherly
smile
which
did
not
leave
his
eager
face
hoch
oestreicher
hoch
russen
kaiser
alexander
hoch
said
he
quoting
words
often
repeated
by
the
german
landlord
busy
already
hurrah
for
the
austrians
hurrah
for
the
russians
hurrah
for
emperor
alexander
the
german
laughed
came
out
of
the
cowshed
pulled
off
his
cap
and
waving
it
above
his
head
cried
und
die
ganze
welt
hoch
and
hurrah
for
the
whole
world
rostov
waved
his
cap
above
his
head
like
the
german
and
cried
laughing
und
vivat
die
ganze
welt
though
neither
the
german
cleaning
his
cowshed
nor
rostov
back
with
his
platoon
from
foraging
for
hay
had
any
reason
for
rejoicing
they
looked
at
each
other
with
joyful
delight
and
brotherly
love
wagged
their
heads
in
token
of
their
mutual
affection
and
parted
smiling
the
german
returning
to
his
cowshed
and
rostov
going
to
the
cottage
he
occupied
with
denisov
what
about
your
master
he
asked
lavrushka
denisov
s
orderly
whom
all
the
regiment
knew
for
a
rogue
hasn
t
been
in
since
the
evening
must
have
been
losing
answered
lavrushka
i
know
by
now
if
he
wins
he
comes
back
early
to
brag
about
it
but
if
he
stays
out
till
morning
it
means
he
s
lost
and
will
come
back
in
a
rage
will
you
have
coffee
yes
bring
some
ten
minutes
later
lavrushka
brought
the
coffee
he
s
coming
said
he
now
for
trouble
rostov
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
denisov
coming
home
denisov
was
a
small
man
with
a
red
face
sparkling
black
eyes
and
black
tousled
mustache
and
hair
he
wore
an
unfastened
cloak
wide
breeches
hanging
down
in
creases
and
a
crumpled
shako
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
came
up
to
the
porch
gloomily
hanging
his
head
lavwuska
he
shouted
loudly
and
angrily
take
it
off
blockhead
well
i
am
taking
it
off
replied
lavrushka
s
voice
ah
you
re
up
already
said
denisov
entering
the
room
long
ago
answered
rostov
i
have
already
been
for
the
hay
and
have
seen
fraulein
mathilde
weally
and
i
ve
been
losing
bwother
i
lost
yesterday
like
a
damned
fool
cried
denisov
not
pronouncing
his
r
s
such
ill
luck
such
ill
luck
as
soon
as
you
left
it
began
and
went
on
hullo
there
tea
puckering
up
his
face
though
smiling
and
showing
his
short
strong
teeth
he
began
with
stubby
fingers
of
both
hands
to
ruffle
up
his
thick
tangled
black
hair
and
what
devil
made
me
go
to
that
wat
an
officer
nicknamed
the
rat
he
said
rubbing
his
forehead
and
whole
face
with
both
hands
just
fancy
he
didn
t
let
me
win
a
single
cahd
not
one
cahd
he
took
the
lighted
pipe
that
was
offered
to
him
gripped
it
in
his
fist
and
tapped
it
on
the
floor
making
the
sparks
fly
while
he
continued
to
shout
he
lets
one
win
the
singles
and
collahs
it
as
soon
as
one
doubles
it
gives
the
singles
and
snatches
the
doubles
he
scattered
the
burning
tobacco
smashed
the
pipe
and
threw
it
away
then
he
remained
silent
for
a
while
and
all
at
once
looked
cheerfully
with
his
glittering
black
eyes
at
rostov
if
at
least
we
had
some
women
here
but
there
s
nothing
foh
one
to
do
but
dwink
if
we
could
only
get
to
fighting
soon
hullo
who
s
there
he
said
turning
to
the
door
as
he
heard
a
tread
of
heavy
boots
and
the
clinking
of
spurs
that
came
to
a
stop
and
a
respectful
cough
the
squadron
quartermaster
said
lavrushka
denisov
s
face
puckered
still
more
wetched
he
muttered
throwing
down
a
purse
with
some
gold
in
it
wostov
deah
fellow
just
see
how
much
there
is
left
and
shove
the
purse
undah
the
pillow
he
said
and
went
out
to
the
quartermaster
rostov
took
the
money
and
mechanically
arranging
the
old
and
new
coins
in
separate
piles
began
counting
them
ah
telyanin
how
d
ye
do
they
plucked
me
last
night
came
denisov
s
voice
from
the
next
room
where
at
bykov
s
at
the
rat
s
i
knew
it
replied
a
piping
voice
and
lieutenant
telyanin
a
small
officer
of
the
same
squadron
entered
the
room
rostov
thrust
the
purse
under
the
pillow
and
shook
the
damp
little
hand
which
was
offered
him
telyanin
for
some
reason
had
been
transferred
from
the
guards
just
before
this
campaign
he
behaved
very
well
in
the
regiment
but
was
not
liked
rostov
especially
detested
him
and
was
unable
to
overcome
or
conceal
his
groundless
antipathy
to
the
man
well
young
cavalryman
how
is
my
rook
behaving
he
asked
rook
was
a
young
horse
telyanin
had
sold
to
rostov
the
lieutenant
never
looked
the
man
he
was
speaking
to
straight
in
the
face
his
eyes
continually
wandered
from
one
object
to
another
i
saw
you
riding
this
morning
he
added
oh
he
s
all
right
a
good
horse
answered
rostov
though
the
horse
for
which
he
had
paid
seven
hundred
rubbles
was
not
worth
half
that
sum
he
s
begun
to
go
a
little
lame
on
the
left
foreleg
he
added
the
hoof
s
cracked
that
s
nothing
i
ll
teach
you
what
to
do
and
show
you
what
kind
of
rivet
to
use
yes
please
do
said
rostov
i
ll
show
you
i
ll
show
you
it
s
not
a
secret
and
it
s
a
horse
you
ll
thank
me
for
then
i
ll
have
it
brought
round
said
rostov
wishing
to
avoid
telyanin
and
he
went
out
to
give
the
order
in
the
passage
denisov
with
a
pipe
was
squatting
on
the
threshold
facing
the
quartermaster
who
was
reporting
to
him
on
seeing
rostov
denisov
screwed
up
his
face
and
pointing
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
to
the
room
where
telyanin
was
sitting
he
frowned
and
gave
a
shudder
of
disgust
ugh
i
don
t
like
that
fellow
he
said
regardless
of
the
quartermaster
s
presence
rostov
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
nor
do
i
but
what
s
one
to
do
and
having
given
his
order
he
returned
to
telyanin
telyanin
was
sitting
in
the
same
indolent
pose
in
which
rostov
had
left
him
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
well
there
certainly
are
disgusting
people
thought
rostov
as
he
entered
have
you
told
them
to
bring
the
horse
asked
telyanin
getting
up
and
looking
carelessly
about
him
i
have
let
us
go
ourselves
i
only
came
round
to
ask
denisov
about
yesterday
s
order
have
you
got
it
denisov
not
yet
but
where
are
you
off
to
i
want
to
teach
this
young
man
how
to
shoe
a
horse
said
telyanin
they
went
through
the
porch
and
into
the
stable
the
lieutenant
explained
how
to
rivet
the
hoof
and
went
away
to
his
own
quarters
when
rostov
went
back
there
was
a
bottle
of
vodka
and
a
sausage
on
the
table
denisov
was
sitting
there
scratching
with
his
pen
on
a
sheet
of
paper
he
looked
gloomily
in
rostov
s
face
and
said
i
am
witing
to
her
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and
evidently
glad
of
a
chance
to
say
quicker
in
words
what
he
wanted
to
write
told
rostov
the
contents
of
his
letter
you
see
my
fwiend
he
said
we
sleep
when
we
don
t
love
we
are
childwen
of
the
dust
but
one
falls
in
love
and
one
is
a
god
one
is
pua
as
on
the
fihst
day
of
cweation
who

that
now
send

to
the
devil
i
m

he
shouted
to
lavrushka
who
went
up
to
him
not
in
the
least
abashed
who
should
it
be
you
yourself
told
him
to
come
it
s
the
quartermaster
for
the
money
denisov
frowned
and
was
about
to
shout
some
reply
but
stopped
wetched
business
he
muttered
to
himself
how
much
is
left
in
the
puhse
he
asked
turning
to
rostov
seven
new
and
three
old
imperials
oh

s
wetched
well
what
are
you
standing
there
for

sca

he
shouted
to
lavrushka
please
denisov

me
lend
you
some
i

some
you

said
rostov
blushing
don
t
like
bowwowing
from
my
own
fellows

growled
denisov
but
if
you
won
t
accept
money
from
me
like
a
comrade
you
will
offend
me
really
i
have
some
rostov
repeated
no

and
denisov
went
to
the
bed
to
get
the
purse
from
under
the
pillow
where
have
you
put
it
wostov
under
the
lower
pillow

denisov
threw
both
pillows
on
the
floor
the
purse
was
not
there
that
s
a
miwacle
wait
haven
t
you
dropped
it
said
rostov
picking
up
the
pillows
one
at
a
time
and
shaking
them
he
pulled
off
the
quilt
and
shook
it
the
purse
was
not
there
dear
me
can
i
have
forgotten
no
i
remember
thinking
that
you
kept
it
under
your
head
like
a
treasure
said
rostov
i
put
it
just
here
where
is
it
he
asked
turning
to
lavrushka
i
haven
t
been
in
the
room
it
must
be
where
you
put
it
but
it
isn
t
you

a
thing

anywhere
and
forget
it

in
your
pockets
no
if
i
hadn
t
thought
of
it
being
a
treasure
said
rostov
but
i
remember
putting
it
there
lavrushka
turned
all
the
bedding
over
looked
under
the
bed
and
under
the
table
searched
everywhere
and
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
denisov
silently
watched
lavrushka
s
movements
and
when
the
latter
threw
up
his
arms
in
surprise
saying
it
was
nowhere
to
be
found
denisov
glanced
at
rostov
wostov
you
ve
not
been
playing
schoolboy
twicks
rostov
felt
denisov
s
gaze
fixed
on
him
raised
his
eyes
and
instantly
dropped
them
again
all
the
blood
which
had
seemed
congested
somewhere
below
his
throat
rushed
to
his
face
and
eyes
he
could
not
draw
breath
and
there
hasn
t
been
anyone
in
the
room
except
the
lieutenant
and
yourselves
it
must
be
here
somewhere
said
lavrushka
now
then
you
devil
s
puppet
look
alive
and
hunt
for
it
shouted
denisov
suddenly
turning
purple
and
rushing
at
the
man
with
a
threatening
gesture
if
the
purse
isn
t
found
i
ll
flog
you
i
ll
flog
you
all
rostov
his
eyes
avoiding
denisov
began
buttoning
his
coat
buckled
on
his
saber
and
put
on
his
cap
i
must
have
that
purse
i
tell
you
shouted
denisov
shaking
his
orderly
by
the
shoulders
and
knocking
him
against
the
wall
denisov
let
him
alone
i
know
who
has
taken
it
said
rostov
going
toward
the
door
without
raising
his
eyes
denisov
paused
thought
a
moment
and
evidently
understanding
what
rostov
hinted
at
seized
his
arm
nonsense
he
cried
and
the
veins
on
his
forehead
and
neck
stood
out
like
cords
you
are
mad
i
tell
you
i
won
t
allow
it

purse

ll

scoundwel

repeated
rostov
in
an
unsteady
voice
and
went
to
the
door
and
i
tell
you
don
t
you
dahe
to
do
it
shouted
denisov
rushing
at
the
cadet
to
restrain
him
but
rostov
pulled
away
his
arm
and
with
as
much
anger
as
though
denisov
were
his
worst
enemy
firmly
fixed
his
eyes
directly
on
his
face
do
you
understand
what
you
re
saying
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
except
myself
so
that
if
it
is
not
so
then
he
could
not
finish
and
ran
out
of
the
room
ah
may
the
devil
take
you
and
evewybody
were
the
last
words
rostov
heard
rostov
went
to
telyanin
s
quarters
the
master
is
not
in
he
s
gone
to
headquarters
said
telyanin
s
orderly
has
something
happened
he
added
surprised
at
the
cadet
s
troubled
face
no
nothing
you
ve
only
just
missed
him
said
the
orderly
the
headquarters
were
situated
two
miles
away
from
salzeneck
and
rostov
without
returning
home
took
a
horse
and
rode
there
there
was
an
inn
in
the
village
which
the
officers
frequented
rostov
rode
up
to
it
and
saw
telyanin
s
horse
at
the
porch
in
the
second
room
of
the
inn
the
lieutenant
was
sitting
over
a
dish
of
sausages
and
a
bottle
of
wine
ah
you
ve
come
here
too
young
man
he
said
smiling
and
raising
his
eyebrows
yes
said
rostov
as
if
it
cost
him
a
great
deal
to
utter
the
word
and
he
sat
down
at
the
nearest
table
both
were
silent
there
were
two
germans
and
a
russian
officer
in
the
room
no
one
spoke
and
the
only
sounds
heard
were
the
clatter
of
knives
and
the
munching
of
the
lieutenant
when
telyanin
had
finished
his
lunch
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
double
purse
and
drawing
its
rings
aside
with
his
small
white
turned
up
fingers
drew
out
a
gold
imperial
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
gave
it
to
the
waiter
please
be
quick
he
said
the
coin
was
a
new
one
rostov
rose
and
went
up
to
telyanin
allow
me
to
look
at
your
purse
he
said
in
a
low
almost
inaudible
voice
with
shifting
eyes
but
eyebrows
still
raised
telyanin
handed
him
the
purse
yes
it
s
a
nice
purse
yes
yes
he
said
growing
suddenly
pale
and
added
look
at
it
young
man
rostov
took
the
purse
in
his
hand
examined
it
and
the
money
in
it
and
looked
at
telyanin
the
lieutenant
was
looking
about
in
his
usual
way
and
suddenly
seemed
to
grow
very
merry
if
we
get
to
vienna
i
ll
get
rid
of
it
there
but
in
these
wretched
little
towns
there
s
nowhere
to
spend
it
said
he
well
let
me
have
it
young
man
i
m
going
rostov
did
not
speak
and
you
are
you
going
to
have
lunch
too
they
feed
you
quite
decently
here
continued
telyanin
now
then
let
me
have
it
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
hold
of
the
purse
rostov
let
go
of
it
telyanin
took
the
purse
and
began
carelessly
slipping
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
riding
breeches
with
his
eyebrows
lifted
and
his
mouth
slightly
open
as
if
to
say
yes
yes
i
am
putting
my
purse
in
my
pocket
and
that
s
quite
simple
and
is
no
one
else
s
business
well
young
man
he
said
with
a
sigh
and
from
under
his
lifted
brows
he
glanced
into
rostov
s
eyes
some
flash
as
of
an
electric
spark
shot
from
telyanin
s
eyes
to
rostov
s
and
back
and
back
again
and
again
in
an
instant
come
here
said
rostov
catching
hold
of
telyanin
s
arm
and
almost
dragging
him
to
the
window
that
money
is
denisov
s
you
took
it
he
whispered
just
above
telyanin
s
ear
what
what
how
dare
you
what
said
telyanin
but
these
words
came
like
a
piteous
despairing
cry
and
an
entreaty
for
pardon
as
soon
as
rostov
heard
them
an
enormous
load
of
doubt
fell
from
him
he
was
glad
and
at
the
same
instant
began
to
pity
the
miserable
man
who
stood
before
him
but
the
task
he
had
begun
had
to
be
completed
heaven
only
knows
what
the
people
here
may
imagine
muttered
telyanin
taking
up
his
cap
and
moving
toward
a
small
empty
room
we
must
have
an
explanation
i
know
it
and
shall
prove
it
said
rostov
i
every
muscle
of
telyanin
s
pale
terrified
face
began
to
quiver
his
eyes
still
shifted
from
side
to
side
but
with
a
downward
look
not
rising
to
rostov
s
face
and
his
sobs
were
audible
count
don
t
ruin
a
young
fellow
here
is
this
wretched
money
take
it
he
threw
it
on
the
table
i
have
an
old
father
and
mother
rostov
took
the
money
avoiding
telyanin
s
eyes
and
went
out
of
the
room
without
a
word
but
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
then
retraced
his
steps
o
god
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
how
could
you
do
it
count
said
telyanin
drawing
nearer
to
him
don
t
touch
me
said
rostov
drawing
back
if
you
need
it
take
the
money
and
he
threw
the
purse
to
him
and
ran
out
of
the
inn
chapter
v
that
same
evening
there
was
an
animated
discussion
among
the
squadron
s
officers
in
denisov
s
quarters
and
i
tell
you
rostov
that
you
must
apologize
to
the
colonel
said
a
tall
grizzly
haired
staff
captain
with
enormous
mustaches
and
many
wrinkles
on
his
large
features
to
rostov
who
was
crimson
with
excitement
the
staff
captain
kirsten
had
twice
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
for
affairs
of
honor
and
had
twice
regained
his
commission
i
will
allow
no
one
to
call
me
a
liar
cried
rostov
he
told
me
i
lied
and
i
told
him
he
lied
and
there
it
rests
he
may
keep
me
on
duty
every
day
or
may
place
me
under
arrest
but
no
one
can
make
me
apologize
because
if
he
as
commander
of
this
regiment
thinks
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
give
me
satisfaction
then
you
just
wait
a
moment
my
dear
fellow
and
listen
interrupted
the
staff
captain
in
his
deep
bass
calmly
stroking
his
long
mustache
you
tell
the
colonel
in
the
presence
of
other
officers
that
an
officer
has
stolen
i
m
not
to
blame
that
the
conversation
began
in
the
presence
of
other
officers
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
before
them
but
i
am
not
a
diplomatist
that
s
why
i
joined
the
hussars
thinking
that
here
one
would
not
need
finesse
and
he
tells
me
that
i
am
lying
so
let
him
give
me
satisfaction
that
s
all
right
no
one
thinks
you
a
coward
but
that
s
not
the
point
ask
denisov
whether
it
is
not
out
of
the
question
for
a
cadet
to
demand
satisfaction
of
his
regimental
commander
denisov
sat
gloomily
biting
his
mustache
and
listening
to
the
conversation
evidently
with
no
wish
to
take
part
in
it
he
answered
the
staff
captain
s
question
by
a
disapproving
shake
of
his
head
you
speak
to
the
colonel
about
this
nasty
business
before
other
officers
continued
the
staff
captain
and
bogdanich
the
colonel
was
called
bogdanich
shuts
you
up
he
did
not
shut
me
up
he
said
i
was
telling
an
untruth
well
have
it
so
and
you
talked
a
lot
of
nonsense
to
him
and
must
apologize
not
on
any
account
exclaimed
rostov
i
did
not
expect
this
of
you
said
the
staff
captain
seriously
and
severely
you
don
t
wish
to
apologize
but
man
it
s
not
only
to
him
but
to
the
whole
regiment
all
of
us
you
re
to
blame
all
round
the
case
is
this
you
ought
to
have
thought
the
matter
over
and
taken
advice
but
no
you
go
and
blurt
it
all
straight
out
before
the
officers
now
what
was
the
colonel
to
do
have
the
officer
tried
and
disgrace
the
whole
regiment
disgrace
the
whole
regiment
because
of
one
scoundrel
is
that
how
you
look
at
it
we
don
t
see
it
like
that
and
bogdanich
was
a
brick
he
told
you
you
were
saying
what
was
not
true
it
s
not
pleasant
but
what
s
to
be
done
my
dear
fellow
you
landed
yourself
in
it
and
now
when
one
wants
to
smooth
the
thing
over
some
conceit
prevents
your
apologizing
and
you
wish
to
make
the
whole
affair
public
you
are
offended
at
being
put
on
duty
a
bit
but
why
not
apologize
to
an
old
and
honorable
officer
whatever
bogdanich
may
be
anyway
he
is
an
honorable
and
brave
old
colonel
you
re
quick
at
taking
offense
but
you
don
t
mind
disgracing
the
whole
regiment
the
staff
captain
s
voice
began
to
tremble
you
have
been
in
the
regiment
next
to
no
time
my
lad
you
re
here
today
and
tomorrow
you
ll
be
appointed
adjutant
somewhere
and
can
snap
your
fingers
when
it
is
said
there
are
thieves
among
the
pavlograd
officers
but
it
s
not
all
the
same
to
us
am
i
not
right
denisov
it
s
not
the
same
denisov
remained
silent
and
did
not
move
but
occasionally
looked
with
his
glittering
black
eyes
at
rostov
you
value
your
own
pride
and
don
t
wish
to
apologize
continued
the
staff
captain
but
we
old
fellows
who
have
grown
up
in
and
god
willing
are
going
to
die
in
the
regiment
we
prize
the
honor
of
the
regiment
and
bogdanich
knows
it
oh
we
do
prize
it
old
fellow
and
all
this
is
not
right
it
s
not
right
you
may
take
offense
or
not
but
i
always
stick
to
mother
truth
it
s
not
right
and
the
staff
captain
rose
and
turned
away
from
rostov
that
s
twue
devil
take
it
shouted
denisov
jumping
up
now
then
wostov
now
then
rostov
growing
red
and
pale
alternately
looked
first
at
one
officer
and
then
at
the
other
no
gentlemen
no
you
mustn
t
think
i
quite
understand
you
re
wrong
to
think
that
of
me
i
for
me
for
the
honor
of
the
regiment
i
d
ah
well
i
ll
show
that
in
action
and
for
me
the
honor
of
the
flag
well
never

true
i
m
to
blame
to
blame
all
round
well
what
else
do
you
want
come
that
s
right
count
cried
the
staff
captain
turning
round
and
clapping
rostov
on
the
shoulder
with
his
big
hand
i
tell
you
shouted
denisov
he
s
a
fine
fellow
that
s
better
count
said
the
staff
captain
beginning
to
address
rostov
by
his
title
as
if
in
recognition
of
his
confession
go
and
apologize
your
excellency
yes
go
gentlemen
i
ll
do
anything
no
one
shall
hear
a
word
from
me
said
rostov
in
an
imploring
voice
but
i
can
t
apologize
by
god
i
can
t
do
what
you
will
how
can
i
go
and
apologize
like
a
little
boy
asking
forgiveness
denisov
began
to
laugh
it
ll
be
worse
for
you
bogdanich
is
vindictive
and
you
ll
pay
for
your
obstinacy
said
kirsten
no
on
my
word
it
s
not
obstinacy
i
can
t
describe
the
feeling
i
can
t
well
it
s
as
you
like
said
the
staff
captain
and
what
has
become
of
that
scoundrel
he
asked
denisov
he
has
weported
himself
sick
he
s
to
be
stwuck
off
the
list
tomowwow
muttered
denisov
it
is
an
illness
there

no
other
way
of
explaining
it
said
the
staff
captain

not
he
d

cwoss
my
path

shouted
denisov
in
a
bloodthirsty
tone
just
then
zherkov
entered
the
room
what

the
officers
turning
to
the
newcomer

long
chapter
vi
kutuzov
fell
back
toward
vienna
destroying
behind
him
the
bridges
over
the
rivers
inn
at
braunau
and
traun
near
linz
on
october
the
russian
troops
were
crossing
the
river
enns
at
midday
the
russian
baggage
train
the
artillery
and
columns
of
troops
were
defiling
through
the
town
of
enns
on
both
sides
of
the
bridge
it
was
a
warm
rainy
autumnal
day
the
wide
expanse
that
opened
out
before
the
heights
on
which
the
russian
batteries
stood
guarding
the
bridge
was
at
times
veiled
by
a
diaphanous
curtain
of
slanting
rain
and
then
suddenly
spread
out
in
the
sunlight
far
distant
objects
could
be
clearly
seen
glittering
as
though
freshly
varnished
down
below
the
little
town
could
be
seen
with
its
white
red
roofed
houses
its
cathedral
and
its
bridge
on
both
sides
of
which
streamed
jostling
masses
of
russian
troops
at
the
bend
of
the
danube
vessels
an
island
and
a
castle
with
a
park
surrounded
by
the
waters
of
the
confluence
of
the
enns
and
the
danube
became
visible
and
the
rocky
left
bank
of
the
danube
covered
with
pine
forests
with
a
mystic
background
of
green
treetops
and
bluish
gorges
the
turrets
of
a
convent
stood
out
beyond
a
wild
virgin
pine
forest
and
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
enns
the
enemy
s
horse
patrols
could
be
discerned
among
the
field
guns
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
general
in
command
of
the
rearguard
stood
with
a
staff
officer
scanning
the
country
through
his
fieldglass
a
little
behind
them
nesvitski
who
had
been
sent
to
the
rearguard
by
the
commander
in
chief
was
sitting
on
the
trail
of
a
gun
carriage
a
cossack
who
accompanied
him
had
handed
him
a
knapsack
and
a
flask
and
nesvitski
was
treating
some
officers
to
pies
and
real
doppelkummel
the
officers
gladly
gathered
round
him
some
on
their
knees
some
squatting
turkish
fashion
on
the
wet
grass
yes
the
austrian
prince
who
built
that
castle
was
no
fool
it
s
a
fine
place
why
are
you
not
eating
anything
gentlemen
nesvitski
was
saying
thank
you
very
much
prince
answered
one
of
the
officers
pleased
to
be
talking
to
a
staff
officer
of
such
importance
it
s
a
lovely
place
we
passed
close
to
the
park
and
saw
two
deer
and
what
a
splendid
house
look
prince
said
another
who
would
have
dearly
liked
to
take
another
pie
but
felt
shy
and
therefore
pretended
to
be
examining
the
countryside
see
our
infantrymen
have
already
got
there
look
there
in
the
meadow
behind
the
village
three
of
them
are
dragging
something
they
ll
ransack
that
castle
he
remarked
with
evident
approval
so
they
will
said
nesvitski
no
but
what
i
should
like
added
he
munching
a
pie
in
his
moist
lipped
handsome
mouth
would
be
to
slip
in
over
there
he
pointed
with
a
smile
to
a
turreted
nunnery
and
his
eyes
narrowed
and
gleamed
that
would
be
fine
gentlemen
the
officers
laughed
just
to
flutter
the
nuns
a
bit
they
say
there
are
italian
girls
among
them
on
my
word
i
d
give
five
years
of
my
life
for
it
they
must
be
feeling
dull
too
said
one
of
the
bolder
officers
laughing
meanwhile
the
staff
officer
standing
in
front
pointed
out
something
to
the
general
who
looked
through
his
field
glass
yes
so
it
is
so
it
is
said
the
general
angrily
lowering
the
field
glass
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
so
it
is
they
ll
be
fired
on
at
the
crossing
and
why
are
they
dawdling
there
on
the
opposite
side
the
enemy
could
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
and
from
their
battery
a
milk
white
cloud
arose
then
came
the
distant
report
of
a
shot
and
our
troops
could
be
seen
hurrying
to
the
crossing
nesvitski
rose
puffing
and
went
up
to
the
general
smiling
would
not
your
excellency
like
a
little
refreshment
he
said
it
s
a
bad
business
said
the
general
without
answering
him
our
men
have
been
wasting
time
hadn
t
i
better
ride
over
your
excellency
asked
nesvitski
yes
please
do
answered
the
general
and
he
repeated
the
order
that
had
already
once
been
given
in
detail
and
tell
the
hussars
that
they
are
to
cross
last
and
to
fire
the
bridge
as
i
ordered
and
the
inflammable
material
on
the
bridge
must
be
reinspected
very
good
answered
nesvitski
he
called
the
cossack
with
his
horse
told
him
to
put
away
the
knapsack
and
flask
and
swung
his
heavy
person
easily
into
the
saddle
i
ll
really
call
in
on
the
nuns
he
said
to
the
officers
who
watched
him
smilingly
and
he
rode
off
by
the
winding
path
down
the
hill
now
then
let
s
see
how
far
it
will
carry
captain
just
try
said
the
general
turning
to
an
artillery
officer
have
a
little
fun
to
pass
the
time
crew
to
your
guns
commanded
the
officer
in
a
moment
the
men
came
running
gaily
from
their
campfires
and
began
loading
one
came
the
command
number
one
jumped
briskly
aside
the
gun
rang
out
with
a
deafening
metallic
roar
and
a
whistling
grenade
flew
above
the
heads
of
our
troops
below
the
hill
and
fell
far
short
of
the
enemy
a
little
smoke
showing
the
spot
where
it
burst
the
faces
of
officers
and
men
brightened
up
at
the
sound
everyone
got
up
and
began
watching
the
movements
of
our
troops
below
as
plainly
visible
as
if
but
a
stone
s
throw
away
and
the
movements
of
the
approaching
enemy
farther
off
at
the
same
instant
the
sun
came
fully
out
from
behind
the
clouds
and
the
clear
sound
of
the
solitary
shot
and
the
brilliance
of
the
bright
sunshine
merged
in
a
single
joyous
and
spirited
impression
chapter
vii
two
of
the
enemy
s
shots
had
already
flown
across
the
bridge
where
there
was
a
crush
halfway
across
stood
prince
nesvitski
who
had
alighted
from
his
horse
and
whose
big
body
was
jammed
against
the
railings
he
looked
back
laughing
to
the
cossack
who
stood
a
few
steps
behind
him
holding
two
horses
by
their
bridles
each
time
prince
nesvitski
tried
to
move
on
soldiers
and
carts
pushed
him
back
again
and
pressed
him
against
the
railings
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
smile
what
a
fine
fellow
you
are
friend
said
the
cossack
to
a
convoy
soldier
with
a
wagon
who
was
pressing
onto
the
infantrymen
who
were
crowded
together
close
to
his
wheels
and
his
horses
what
a
fellow
you
can
t
wait
a
moment
don
t
you
see
the
general
wants
to
pass
but
the
convoyman
took
no
notice
of
the
word
general
and
shouted
at
the
soldiers
who
were
blocking
his
way
hi
there
boys
keep
to
the
left
wait
a
bit
but
the
soldiers
crowded
together
shoulder
to
shoulder
their
bayonets
interlocking
moved
over
the
bridge
in
a
dense
mass
looking
down
over
the
rails
prince
nesvitski
saw
the
rapid
noisy
little
waves
of
the
enns
which
rippling
and
eddying
round
the
piles
of
the
bridge
chased
each
other
along
looking
on
the
bridge
he
saw
equally
uniform
living
waves
of
soldiers
shoulder
straps
covered
shakos
knapsacks
bayonets
long
muskets
and
under
the
shakos
faces
with
broad
cheekbones
sunken
cheeks
and
listless
tired
expressions
and
feet
that
moved
through
the
sticky
mud
that
covered
the
planks
of
the
bridge
sometimes
through
the
monotonous
waves
of
men
like
a
fleck
of
white
foam
on
the
waves
of
the
enns
an
officer
in
a
cloak
and
with
a
type
of
face
different
from
that
of
the
men
squeezed
his
way
along
sometimes
like
a
chip
of
wood
whirling
in
the
river
an
hussar
on
foot
an
orderly
or
a
townsman
was
carried
through
the
waves
of
infantry
and
sometimes
like
a
log
floating
down
the
river
an
officers
or
company
s
baggage
wagon
piled
high
leather
covered
and
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
moved
across
the
bridge
it
s
as
if
a
dam
had
burst
said
the
cossack
hopelessly
are
there
many
more
of
you
to
come
a
million
all
but
one
replied
a
waggish
soldier
in
a
torn
coat
with
a
wink
and
passed
on
followed
by
another
an
old
man
if
he
he
meant
the
enemy
begins
popping
at
the
bridge
now
said
the
old
soldier
dismally
to
a
comrade
you
ll
forget
to
scratch
yourself
that
soldier
passed
on
and
after
him
came
another
sitting
on
a
cart
where
the
devil
have
the
leg
bands
been
shoved
to
said
an
orderly
running
behind
the
cart
and
fumbling
in
the
back
of
it
and
he
also
passed
on
with
the
wagon
then
came
some
merry
soldiers
who
had
evidently
been
drinking
and
then
old
fellow
he
gives
him
one
in
the
teeth
with
the
butt
end
of
his
gun
a
soldier
whose
greatcoat
was
well
tucked
up
said
gaily
with
a
wide
swing
of
his
arm
yes
the
ham
was
just
delicious
answered
another
with
a
loud
laugh
and
they
too
passed
on
so
that
nesvitski
did
not
learn
who
had
been
struck
on
the
teeth
or
what
the
ham
had
to
do
with
it
bah
how
they
scurry
he
just
sends
a
ball
and
they
think
they
ll
all
be
killed
a
sergeant
was
saying
angrily
and
reproachfully
as
it
flies
past
me
daddy
the
ball
i
mean
said
a
young
soldier
with
an
enormous
mouth
hardly
refraining
from
laughing
i
felt
like
dying
of
fright
i
did
pon
my
word
i
got
that
frightened
said
he
as
if
bragging
of
having
been
frightened
that
one
also
passed
then
followed
a
cart
unlike
any
that
had
gone
before
it
was
a
german
cart
with
a
pair
of
horses
led
by
a
german
and
seemed
loaded
with
a
whole
houseful
of
effects
a
fine
brindled
cow
with
a
large
udder
was
attached
to
the
cart
behind
a
woman
with
an
unweaned
baby
an
old
woman
and
a
healthy
german
girl
with
bright
red
cheeks
were
sitting
on
some
feather
beds
evidently
these
fugitives
were
allowed
to
pass
by
special
permission
the
eyes
of
all
the
soldiers
turned
toward
the
women
and
while
the
vehicle
was
passing
at
foot
pace
all
the
soldiers
remarks
related
to
the
two
young
ones
every
face
bore
almost
the
same
smile
expressing
unseemly
thoughts
about
the
women
just
see
the
german
sausage
is
making
tracks
too
sell
me
the
missis
said
another
soldier
addressing
the
german
who
angry
and
frightened
strode
energetically
along
with
downcast
eyes
see
how
smart
she
s
made
herself
oh
the
devils
there
fedotov
you
should
be
quartered
on
them
i
have
seen
as
much
before
now
mate
where
are
you
going
asked
an
infantry
officer
who
was
eating
an
apple
also
half
smiling
as
he
looked
at
the
handsome
girl
the
german
closed
his
eyes
signifying
that
he
did
not
understand
take
it
if
you
like
said
the
officer
giving
the
girl
an
apple
the
girl
smiled
and
took
it
nesvitski
like
the
rest
of
the
men
on
the
bridge
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
women
till
they
had
passed
when
they
had
gone
by
the
same
stream
of
soldiers
followed
with
the
same
kind
of
talk
and
at
last
all
stopped
as
often
happens
the
horses
of
a
convoy
wagon
became
restive
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
and
the
whole
crowd
had
to
wait
and
why
are
they
stopping
there
s
no
proper
order
said
the
soldiers
where
are
you
shoving
to
devil
take
you
can
t
you
wait
it
ll
be
worse
if
he
fires
the
bridge
see
here
s
an
officer
jammed
in
too
different
voices
were
saying
in
the
crowd
as
the
men
looked
at
one
another
and
all
pressed
toward
the
exit
from
the
bridge
looking
down
at
the
waters
of
the
enns
under
the
bridge
nesvitski
suddenly
heard
a
sound
new
to
him
of
something
swiftly
approaching
something
big
that
splashed
into
the
water
just
see
where
it
carries
to
a
soldier
near
by
said
sternly
looking
round
at
the
sound
encouraging
us
to
get
along
quicker
said
another
uneasily
the
crowd
moved
on
again
nesvitski
realized
that
it
was
a
cannon
ball
hey
cossack
my
horse
he
said
now
then
you
there
get
out
of
the
way
make
way
with
great
difficulty
he
managed
to
get
to
his
horse
and
shouting
continually
he
moved
on
the
soldiers
squeezed
themselves
to
make
way
for
him
but
again
pressed
on
him
so
that
they
jammed
his
leg
and
those
nearest
him
were
not
to
blame
for
they
were
themselves
pressed
still
harder
from
behind
nesvitski
nesvitski
you
numskull
came
a
hoarse
voice
from
behind
him
nesvitski
looked
round
and
saw
some
fifteen
paces
away
but
separated
by
the
living
mass
of
moving
infantry
vaska
denisov
red
and
shaggy
with
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
black
head
and
a
cloak
hanging
jauntily
over
his
shoulder
tell
these
devils
these
fiends
to
let
me
pass
shouted
denisov
evidently
in
a
fit
of
rage
his
coal
black
eyes
with
their
bloodshot
whites
glittering
and
rolling
as
he
waved
his
sheathed
saber
in
a
small
bare
hand
as
red
as
his
face
ah
vaska
joyfully
replied
nesvitski
what
s
up
with
you
the
squadwon
can
t
pass
shouted
vaska
denisov
showing
his
white
teeth
fiercely
and
spurring
his
black
thoroughbred
arab
which
twitched
its
ears
as
the
bayonets
touched
it
and
snorted
spurting
white
foam
from
his
bit
tramping
the
planks
of
the
bridge
with
his
hoofs
and
apparently
ready
to
jump
over
the
railings
had
his
rider
let
him
what
is
this
they
re
like
sheep
just
like
sheep
out
of
the
way
let
us
pass
stop
there
you
devil
with
the
cart
i
ll
hack
you
with
my
saber
he
shouted
actually
drawing
his
saber
from
its
scabbard
and
flourishing
it
the
soldiers
crowded
against
one
another
with
terrified
faces
and
denisov
joined
nesvitski
how
s
it
you
re
not
drunk
today
said
nesvitski
when
the
other
had
ridden
up
to
him
they
don
t
even
give
one
time
to
dwink
answered
vaska
denisov
they
keep
dwagging
the
wegiment
to
and
fwo
all
day
if
they
mean
to
fight
let
s
fight
but
the
devil
knows
what
this
is
what
a
dandy
you
are
today
said
nesvitski
looking
at
denisov
s
new
cloak
and
saddlecloth
denisov
smiled
took
out
of
his
sabretache
a
handkerchief
that
diffused
a
smell
of
perfume
and
put
it
to
nesvitski
s
nose
of
course
i
m
going
into
action
i
ve
shaved
bwushed
my
teeth
and
scented
myself
the
imposing
figure
of
nesvitski
followed
by
his
cossack
and
the
determination
of
denisov
who
flourished
his
sword
and
shouted
frantically
had
such
an
effect
that
they
managed
to
squeeze
through
to
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
and
stopped
the
infantry
beside
the
bridge
nesvitski
found
the
colonel
to
whom
he
had
to
deliver
the
order
and
having
done
this
he
rode
back
having
cleared
the
way
denisov
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
carelessly
holding
in
his
stallion
that
was
neighing
and
pawing
the
ground
eager
to
rejoin
its
fellows
he
watched
his
squadron
draw
nearer
then
the
clang
of
hoofs
as
of
several
horses
galloping
resounded
on
the
planks
of
the
bridge
and
the
squadron
officers
in
front
and
men
four
abreast
spread
across
the
bridge
and
began
to
emerge
on
his
side
of
it
the
infantry
who
had
been
stopped
crowded
near
the
bridge
in
the
trampled
mud
and
gazed
with
that
particular
feeling
of
ill
will
estrangement
and
ridicule
with
which
troops
of
different
arms
usually
encounter
one
another
at
the
clean
smart
hussars
who
moved
past
them
in
regular
order
smart
lads
only
fit
for
a
fair
said
one
what
good
are
they
they
re
led
about
just
for
show
remarked
another
don

kick
up
the
dust
you

jested
an
hussar
whose
prancing
horse
had
splashed
mud
over
some
foot
soldiers
i

like
to
put
you
on
a
two
days
march
with
a
knapsack
your
fine
cords
would
soon
get
a
bit
rubbed
said
an
infantryman
wiping
the
mud
off
his
face
with
his
sleeve
perched
up
there
you
re
more
like
a
bird
than
a
man
there
now
zikin
they
ought
to
put
you
on
a
horse

look

soldier

weight
of

chapter
viii
the
last
of
the
infantry
hurriedly
crossed
the
bridge
squeezing
together
as
they
approached
it
as
if
passing
through
a
funnel
at
last
the
baggage
wagons
had
all
crossed
the
crush
was
less
and
the
last
battalion
came
onto
the
bridge
only
denisov
s
squadron
of
hussars
remained
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
facing
the
enemy
who
could
be
seen
from
the
hill
on
the
opposite
bank
but
was
not
yet
visible
from
the
bridge
for
the
horizon
as
seen
from
the
valley
through
which
the
river
flowed
was
formed
by
the
rising
ground
only
half
a
mile
away
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
lay
wasteland
over
which
a
few
groups
of
our
cossack
scouts
were
moving
suddenly
on
the
road
at
the
top
of
the
high
ground
artillery
and
troops
in
blue
uniform
were
seen
these
were
the
french
a
group
of
cossack
scouts
retired
down
the
hill
at
a
trot
all
the
officers
and
men
of
denisov
s
squadron
though
they
tried
to
talk
of
other
things
and
to
look
in
other
directions
thought
only
of
what
was
there
on
the
hilltop
and
kept
constantly
looking
at
the
patches
appearing
on
the
skyline
which
they
knew
to
be
the
enemy
s
troops
the
weather
had
cleared
again
since
noon
and
the
sun
was
descending
brightly
upon
the
danube
and
the
dark
hills
around
it
it
was
calm
and
at
intervals
the
bugle
calls
and
the
shouts
of
the
enemy
could
be
heard
from
the
hill
there
was
no
one
now
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
except
a
few
scattered
skirmishers
an
empty
space
of
some
seven
hundred
yards
was
all
that
separated
them
the
enemy
ceased
firing
and
that
stern
threatening
inaccessible
and
intangible
line
which
separates
two
hostile
armies
was
all
the
more
clearly
felt
one
step
beyond
that
boundary
line
which
resembles
the
line
dividing
the
living
from
the
dead
lies
uncertainty
suffering
and
death
and
what
is
there
who
is
there
there
beyond
that
field
that
tree
that
roof
lit
up
by
the
sun
no
one
knows
but
one
wants
to
know
you
fear
and
yet
long
to
cross
that
line
and
know
that
sooner
or
later
it
must
be
crossed
and
you
will
have
to
find
out
what
is
there
just
as
you
will
inevitably
have
to
learn
what
lies
the
other
side
of
death
but
you
are
strong
healthy
cheerful
and
excited
and
are
surrounded
by
other
such
excitedly
animated
and
healthy
men
so
thinks
or
at
any
rate
feels
anyone
who
comes
in
sight
of
the
enemy
and
that
feeling
gives
a
particular
glamour
and
glad
keenness
of
impression
to
everything
that
takes
place
at
such
moments
on
the
high
ground
where
the
enemy
was
the
smoke
of
a
cannon
rose
and
a
ball
flew
whistling
over
the
heads
of
the
hussar
squadron
the
officers
who
had
been
standing
together
rode
off
to
their
places
the
hussars
began
carefully
aligning
their
horses
silence
fell
on
the
whole
squadron
all
were
looking
at
the
enemy
in
front
and
at
the
squadron
commander
awaiting
the
word
of
command
a
second
and
a
third
cannon
ball
flew
past
evidently
they
were
firing
at
the
hussars
but
the
balls
with
rapid
rhythmic
whistle
flew
over
the
heads
of
the
horsemen
and
fell
somewhere
beyond
them
the
hussars
did
not
look
round
but
at
the
sound
of
each
shot
as
at
the
word
of
command
the
whole
squadron
with
its
rows
of
faces
so
alike
yet
so
different
holding
its
breath
while
the
ball
flew
past
rose
in
the
stirrups
and
sank
back
again
the
soldiers
without
turning
their
heads
glanced
at
one
another
curious
to
see
their
comrades
impression
every
face
from
denisov
s
to
that
of
the
bugler
showed
one
common
expression
of
conflict
irritation
and
excitement
around
chin
and
mouth
the
quartermaster
frowned
looking
at
the
soldiers
as
if
threatening
to
punish
them
cadet
mironov
ducked
every
time
a
ball
flew
past
rostov
on
the
left
flank
mounted
on
his
rook
a
handsome
horse
despite
its
game
leg
had
the
happy
air
of
a
schoolboy
called
up
before
a
large
audience
for
an
examination
in
which
he
feels
sure
he
will
distinguish
himself
he
was
glancing
at
everyone
with
a
clear
bright
expression
as
if
asking
them
to
notice
how
calmly
he
sat
under
fire
but
despite
himself
on
his
face
too
that
same
indication
of
something
new
and
stern
showed
round
the
mouth
who
s
that
curtseying
there
cadet
miwonov
that
s
not
wight
look
at
me
cried
denisov
who
unable
to
keep
still
on
one
spot
kept
turning
his
horse
in
front
of
the
squadron
the
black
hairy
snub
nosed
face
of
vaska
denisov
and
his
whole
short
sturdy
figure
with
the
sinewy
hairy
hand
and
stumpy
fingers
in
which
he
held
the
hilt
of
his
naked
saber
looked
just
as
it
usually
did
especially
toward
evening
when
he
had
emptied
his
second
bottle
he
was
only
redder
than
usual
with
his
shaggy
head
thrown
back
like
birds
when
they
drink
pressing
his
spurs
mercilessly
into
the
sides
of
his
good
horse
bedouin
and
sitting
as
though
falling
backwards
in
the
saddle
he
galloped
to
the
other
flank
of
the
squadron
and
shouted
in
a
hoarse
voice
to
the
men
to
look
to
their
pistols
he
rode
up
to
kirsten
the
staff
captain
on
his
broad
backed
steady
mare
came
at
a
walk
to
meet
him
his
face
with
its
long
mustache
was
serious
as
always
only
his
eyes
were
brighter
than
usual
well
what
about
it
said
he
to
denisov
it
won
t
come
to
a
fight
you
ll
see
we
shall
retire
the
devil
only
knows
what
they
re
about
muttered
denisov
ah
wostov
he
cried
noticing
the
cadet
s
bright
face
you
ve
got
it
at
last
and
he
smiled
approvingly
evidently
pleased
with
the
cadet
rostov
felt
perfectly
happy
just
then
the
commander
appeared
on
the
bridge
denisov
galloped
up
to
him
your
excellency
let
us
attack
them
i
ll
dwive
them
off
attack
indeed
said
the
colonel
in
a
bored
voice
puckering
up
his
face
as
if
driving
off
a
troublesome
fly
and
why
are
you
stopping
here
don
t
you
see
the
skirmishers
are
retreating
lead
the
squadron
back
the
squadron
crossed
the
bridge
and
drew
out
of
range
of
fire
without
having
lost
a
single
man
the
second
squadron
that
had
been
in
the
front
line
followed
them
across
and
the
last
cossacks
quitted
the
farther
side
of
the
river
the
two
pavlograd
squadrons
having
crossed
the
bridge
retired
up
the
hill
one
after
the
other
their
colonel
karl
bogdanich
schubert
came
up
to
denisov
s
squadron
and
rode
at
a
footpace
not
far
from
rostov
without
taking
any
notice
of
him
although
they
were
now
meeting
for
the
first
time
since
their
encounter
concerning
telyanin
rostov
feeling
that
he
was
at
the
front
and
in
the
power
of
a
man
toward
whom
he
now
admitted
that
he
had
been
to
blame
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
the
colonel
s
athletic
back
his
nape
covered
with
light
hair
and
his
red
neck
it
seemed
to
rostov
that
bogdanich
was
only
pretending
not
to
notice
him
and
that
his
whole
aim
now
was
to
test
the
cadet
s
courage
so
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
around
him
merrily
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
bogdanich
rode
so
near
in
order
to
show
him
his
courage
next
he
thought
that
his
enemy
would
send
the
squadron
on
a
desperate
attack
just
to
punish
him
rostov
then
he
imagined
how
after
the
attack
bogdanich
would
come
up
to
him
as
he
lay
wounded
and
would
magnanimously
extend
the
hand
of
reconciliation
the
high
shouldered
figure
of
zherkov
familiar
to
the
pavlograds
as
he
had
but
recently
left
their
regiment
rode
up
to
the
colonel
after
his
dismissal
from
headquarters
zherkov
had
not
remained
in
the
regiment
saying
he
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
slave
at
the
front
when
he
could
get
more
rewards
by
doing
nothing
on
the
staff
and
had
succeeded
in
attaching
himself
as
an
orderly
officer
to
prince
bagration
he
now
came
to
his
former
chief
with
an
order
from
the
commander
of
the
rear
guard
colonel
he
said
addressing
rostov
s
enemy
with
an
air
of
gloomy
gravity
and
glancing
round
at
his
comrades
there
is
an
order
to
stop
and
fire
the
bridge
an
order
to
who
asked
the
colonel
morosely
i
don
t
myself
know
to
who
replied
the
cornet
in
a
serious
tone
but
the
prince
told
me
to
go
and
tell
the
colonel
that
the
hussars
must
return
quickly
and
fire
the
bridge
zherkov
was
followed
by
an
officer
of
the
suite
who
rode
up
to
the
colonel
of
hussars
with
the
same
order
after
him
the
stout
nesvitski
came
galloping
up
on
a
cossack
horse
that
could
scarcely
carry
his
weight
how
s
this
colonel
he
shouted
as
he
approached
i
told
you
to
fire
the
bridge
and
now
someone
has
gone
and
blundered
they
are
all
beside
themselves
over
there
and
one
can
t
make
anything
out
the
colonel
deliberately
stopped
the
regiment
and
turned
to
nesvitski
you
spoke
to
me
of
inflammable
material
said
he
but
you
said
nothing
about
firing
it
but
my
dear
sir
said
nesvitski
as
he
drew
up
taking
off
his
cap
and
smoothing
his
hair
wet
with
perspiration
with
his
plump
hand
wasn
t
i
telling
you
to
fire
the
bridge
when
inflammable
material
had
been
put
in
position
i
am
not
your
dear
sir
mr
staff
officer
and
you
did
not
tell
me
to
burn
the
bridge
i
know
the
service
and
it
is
my
habit
orders
strictly
to
obey
you
said
the
bridge
would
be
burned
but
who
would
it
burn
i
could
not
know
by
the
holy
spirit
ah
that
s
always
the
way
said
nesvitski
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
how
did
you
get
here
said
he
turning
to
zherkov
on
the
same
business
but
you
are
damp
let
me
wring
you
out
you
were
saying
mr
staff
officer
continued
the
colonel
in
an
offended
tone
colonel
interrupted
the
officer
of
the
suite
you
must
be
quick
or
the
enemy
will
bring
up
his
guns
to
use
grapeshot
the
colonel
looked
silently
at
the
officer
of
the
suite
at
the
stout
staff
officer
and
at
zherkov
and
he
frowned
i
will
the
bridge
fire
he
said
in
a
solemn
tone
as
if
to
announce
that
in
spite
of
all
the
unpleasantness
he
had
to
endure
he
would
still
do
the
right
thing
striking
his
horse
with
his
long
muscular
legs
as
if
it
were
to
blame
for
everything
the
colonel
moved
forward
and
ordered
the
second
squadron
that
in
which
rostov
was
serving
under
denisov
to
return
to
the
bridge
there
it
s
just
as
i
thought
said
rostov
to
himself
he
wishes
to
test
me
his
heart
contracted
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
let
him
see
whether
i
am
a
coward
he
thought
again
on
all
the
bright
faces
of
the
squadron
the
serious
expression
appeared
that
they
had
worn
when
under
fire
rostov
watched
his
enemy
the
colonel
closely
to
find
in
his
face
confirmation
of
his
own
conjecture
but
the
colonel
did
not
once
glance
at
rostov
and
looked
as
he
always
did
when
at
the
front
solemn
and
stern
then
came
the
word
of
command
look
sharp
look
sharp
several
voices
repeated
around
him
their
sabers
catching
in
the
bridles
and
their
spurs
jingling
the
hussars
hastily
dismounted
not
knowing
what
they
were
to
do
the
men
were
crossing
themselves
rostov
no
longer
looked
at
the
colonel
he
had
no
time
he
was
afraid
of
falling
behind
the
hussars
so
much
afraid
that
his
heart
stood
still
his
hand
trembled
as
he
gave
his
horse
into
an
orderly
s
charge
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
with
a
thud
denisov
rode
past
him
leaning
back
and
shouting
something
rostov
saw
nothing
but
the
hussars
running
all
around
him
their
spurs
catching
and
their
sabers
clattering
stretchers
shouted
someone
behind
him
rostov
did
not
think
what
this
call
for
stretchers
meant
he
ran
on
trying
only
to
be
ahead
of
the
others
but
just
at
the
bridge
not
looking
at
the
ground
he
came
on
some
sticky
trodden
mud
stumbled
and
fell
on
his
hands
the
others
outstripped
him
at
boss
zides
captain
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
colonel
who
having
ridden
ahead
had
pulled
up
his
horse
near
the
bridge
with
a
triumphant
cheerful
face
rostov
wiping
his
muddy
hands
on
his
breeches
looked
at
his
enemy
and
was
about
to
run
on
thinking
that
the
farther
he
went
to
the
front
the
better
but
bogdanich
without
looking
at
or
recognizing
rostov
shouted
to
him
who
s
that
running
on
the
middle
of
the
bridge
to
the
right
come
back
cadet
he
cried
angrily
and
turning
to
denisov
who
showing
off
his
courage
had
ridden
on
to
the
planks
of
the
bridge
why
run
risks
captain
you
should
dismount
he
said
oh
every
bullet
has
its
billet
answered
vaska
denisov
turning
in
his
saddle
meanwhile
nesvitski
zherkov
and
the
officer
of
the
suite
were
standing
together
out
of
range
of
the
shots
watching
now
the
small
group
of
men
with
yellow
shakos
dark
green
jackets
braided
with
cord
and
blue
riding
breeches
who
were
swarming
near
the
bridge
and
then
at
what
was
approaching
in
the
distance
from
the
opposite
side
the
blue
uniforms
and
groups
with
horses
easily
recognizable
as
artillery
will
they
burn
the
bridge
or
not
who
ll
get
there
first
will
they
get
there
and
fire
the
bridge
or
will
the
french
get
within
grapeshot
range
and
wipe
them
out
these
were
the
questions
each
man
of
the
troops
on
the
high
ground
above
the
bridge
involuntarily
asked
himself
with
a
sinking
heart
watching
the
bridge
and
the
hussars
in
the
bright
evening
light
and
the
blue
tunics
advancing
from
the
other
side
with
their
bayonets
and
guns
ugh
the
hussars
will
get
it
hot
said
nesvitski
they
are
within
grapeshot
range
now
he
shouldn
t
have
taken
so
many
men
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
true
enough
answered
nesvitski
two
smart
fellows
could
have
done
the
job
just
as
well
ah
your
excellency
put
in
zherkov
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
hussars
but
still
with
that
naive
air
that
made
it
impossible
to
know
whether
he
was
speaking
in
jest
or
in
earnest
ah
your
excellency
how
you
look
at
things
send
two
men
and
who
then
would
give
us
the
vladimir
medal
and
ribbon
but
now
even
if
they
do
get
peppered
the
squadron
may
be
recommended
for
honors
and
he
may
get
a
ribbon
our
bogdanich
knows
how
things
are
done
there
now
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
that
s
grapeshot
he
pointed
to
the
french
guns
the
limbers
of
which
were
being
detached
and
hurriedly
removed
on
the
french
side
amid
the
groups
with
cannon
a
cloud
of
smoke
appeared
then
a
second
and
a
third
almost
simultaneously
and
at
the
moment
when
the
first
report
was
heard
a
fourth
was
seen
then
two
reports
one
after
another
and
a
third
oh
oh
groaned
nesvitski
as
if
in
fierce
pain
seizing
the
officer
of
the
suite
by
the
arm
look
a
man
has
fallen
fallen
fallen
two
i
think
if
i
were
tsar
i
would
never
go
to
war
said
nesvitski
turning
away
the
french
guns
were
hastily
reloaded
the
infantry
in
their
blue
uniforms
advanced
toward
the
bridge
at
a
run
smoke
appeared
again
but
at
irregular
intervals
and
grapeshot
cracked
and
rattled
onto
the
bridge
but
this
time
nesvitski
could
not
see
what
was
happening
there
as
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
arose
from
it
the
hussars
had
succeeded
in
setting
it
on
fire
and
the
french
batteries
were
now
firing
at
them
no
longer
to
hinder
them
but
because
the
guns
were
trained
and
there
was
someone
to
fire
at
the
french
had
time
to
fire
three
rounds
of
grapeshot
before
the
hussars
got
back
to
their
horses
two
were
misdirected
and
the
shot
went
too
high
but
the
last
round
fell
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
hussars
and
knocked
three
of
them
over
rostov
absorbed
by
his
relations
with
bogdanich
had
paused
on
the
bridge
not
knowing
what
to
do
there
was
no
one
to
hew
down
as
he
had
always
imagined
battles
to
himself
nor
could
he
help
to
fire
the
bridge
because
he
had
not
brought
any
burning
straw
with
him
like
the
other
soldiers
he
stood
looking
about
him
when
suddenly
he
heard
a
rattle
on
the
bridge
as
if
nuts
were
being
spilt
and
the
hussar
nearest
to
him
fell
against
the
rails
with
a
groan
rostov
ran
up
to
him
with
the
others
again
someone
shouted
stretchers
four
men
seized
the
hussar
and
began
lifting
him
oooh
for
christ
s
sake
let
me
alone
cried
the
wounded
man
but
still
he
was
lifted
and
laid
on
the
stretcher
nicholas
rostov
turned
away
and
as
if
searching
for
something
gazed
into
the
distance
at
the
waters
of
the
danube
at
the
sky
and
at
the
sun
how
beautiful
the
sky
looked
how
blue
how
calm
and
how
deep
how
bright
and
glorious
was
the
setting
sun
with
what
soft
glitter
the
waters
of
the
distant
danube
shone
and
fairer
still
were
the
faraway
blue
mountains
beyond
the
river
the
nunnery
the
mysterious
gorges
and
the
pine
forests
veiled
in
the
mist
of
their
summits
there
was
peace
and
happiness
i
should
wish
for
nothing
else
nothing
if
only
i
were
there
thought
rostov
in
myself
alone
and
in
that
sunshine
there
is
so
much
happiness
but
here
groans
suffering
fear
and
this
uncertainty
and
hurry
there
they
are
shouting
again
and
again
are
all
running
back
somewhere
and
i
shall
run
with
them
and
it
death
is
here
above
me
and
around
another
instant
and
i
shall
never
again
see
the
sun
this
water
that
gorge
at
that
instant
the
sun
began
to
hide
behind
the
clouds
and
other
stretchers
came
into
view
before
rostov
and
the
fear
of
death
and
of
the
stretchers
and
love
of
the
sun
and
of

all
merged
into
one
feeling
of
sickening
agitation
o
lord
god
thou
who
art
in
that
heaven
save
forgive
and
protect
me
rostov
whispered
the
hussars
ran
back
to
the
men
who
held
their
horses
their
voices
sounded
louder
and
calmer
the
stretchers
disappeared
from
sight
well
fwiend
so
you
ve
smelt
powdah
shouted
vaska
denisov
just
above
his
ear
it
s
all
over
but
i
am
a
coward
yes
a
coward
thought
rostov
and
sighing
deeply
he
took
rook
his
horse
which
stood
resting
one
foot
from
the
orderly
and
began
to
mount
was
that
grapeshot
he
asked
denisov
yes
and
no
mistake
cried
denisov
you
worked
like
wegular
bwicks
and
it
s
nasty
work
an
attack
s
pleasant
work
hacking
away
at
the
dogs
but
this
sort
of
thing
is
the
very
devil
with
them
shooting
at
you
like
a
target
and
denisov
rode
up
to
a
group
that
had
stopped
near
rostov
composed
of
the
colonel
nesvitski
zherkov
and
the
officer
from
the
suite
well
it
seems
that
no
one
has
noticed
thought
rostov
and
this
was
true
no
one
had
taken
any
notice
for
everyone
knew
the
sensation
which
the
cadet
under
fire
for
the
first
time
had
experienced
here
s
something
for
you
to
report
said
zherkov
see
if
i
don
t
get
promoted
to
a
sublieutenancy
inform
the
prince
that
i
the
bridge
fired
said
the
colonel
triumphantly
and
gaily
and
if
he
asks
about
the
losses
a
trifle
said
the
colonel
in
his
bass
voice
two
hussars
wounded
and
one
knocked
out
he
added
unable
to
restrain
a
happy
smile
and
pronouncing
the
phrase
knocked
out
with
ringing
distinctness
chapter
ix
pursued
by
the
french
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
under
the
command
of
bonaparte
encountering
a
population
that
was
unfriendly
to
it
losing
confidence
in
its
allies
suffering
from
shortness
of
supplies
and
compelled
to
act
under
conditions
of
war
unlike
anything
that
had
been
foreseen
the
russian
army
of
thirty
five
thousand
men
commanded
by
kutuzov
was
hurriedly
retreating
along
the
danube
stopping
where
overtaken
by
the
enemy
and
fighting
rearguard
actions
only
as
far
as
necessary
to
enable
it
to
retreat
without
losing
its
heavy
equipment
there
had
been
actions
at
lambach
amstetten
and
melk
but
despite
the
courage
and
endurance
acknowledged
even
by
the
enemy
with
which
the
russians
fought
the
only
consequence
of
these
actions
was
a
yet
more
rapid
retreat
austrian
troops
that
had
escaped
capture
at
ulm
and
had
joined
kutuzov
at
braunau
now
separated
from
the
russian
army
and
kutuzov
was
left
with
only
his
own
weak
and
exhausted
forces
the
defense
of
vienna
was
no
longer
to
be
thought
of
instead
of
an
offensive
the
plan
of
which
carefully
prepared
in
accord
with
the
modern
science
of
strategics
had
been
handed
to
kutuzov
when
he
was
in
vienna
by
the
austrian
hofkriegsrath
the
sole
and
almost
unattainable
aim
remaining
for
him
was
to
effect
a
junction
with
the
forces
that
were
advancing
from
russia
without
losing
his
army
as
mack
had
done
at
ulm
on
the
twenty
eighth
of
october
kutuzov
with
his
army
crossed
to
the
left
bank
of
the
danube
and
took
up
a
position
for
the
first
time
with
the
river
between
himself
and
the
main
body
of
the
french
on
the
thirtieth
he
attacked
mortier
s
division
which
was
on
the
left
bank
and
broke
it
up
in
this
action
for
the
first
time
trophies
were
taken
banners
cannon
and
two
enemy
generals
for
the
first
time
after
a
fortnight
s
retreat
the
russian
troops
had
halted
and
after
a
fight
had
not
only
held
the
field
but
had
repulsed
the
french
though
the
troops
were
ill
clad
exhausted
and
had
lost
a
third
of
their
number
in
killed
wounded
sick
and
stragglers
though
a
number
of
sick
and
wounded
had
been
abandoned
on
the
other
side
of
the
danube
with
a
letter
in
which
kutuzov
entrusted
them
to
the
humanity
of
the
enemy
and
though
the
big
hospitals
and
the
houses
in
krems
converted
into
military
hospitals
could
no
longer
accommodate
all
the
sick
and
wounded
yet
the
stand
made
at
krems
and
the
victory
over
mortier
raised
the
spirits
of
the
army
considerably
throughout
the
whole
army
and
at
headquarters
most
joyful
though
erroneous
rumors
were
rife
of
the
imaginary
approach
of
columns
from
russia
of
some
victory
gained
by
the
austrians
and
of
the
retreat
of
the
frightened
bonaparte
prince
andrew
during
the
battle
had
been
in
attendance
on
the
austrian
general
schmidt
who
was
killed
in
the
action
his
horse
had
been
wounded
under
him
and
his
own
arm
slightly
grazed
by
a
bullet
as
a
mark
of
the
commander
in
chief
s
special
favor
he
was
sent
with
the
news
of
this
victory
to
the
austrian
court
now
no
longer
at
vienna
which
was
threatened
by
the
french
but
at
brunn
despite
his
apparently
delicate
build
prince
andrew
could
endure
physical
fatigue
far
better
than
many
very
muscular
men
and
on
the
night
of
the
battle
having
arrived
at
krems
excited
but
not
weary
with
dispatches
from
dokhturov
to
kutuzov
he
was
sent
immediately
with
a
special
dispatch
to
brunn
to
be
so
sent
meant
not
only
a
reward
but
an
important
step
toward
promotion
the
night
was
dark
but
starry
the
road
showed
black
in
the
snow
that
had
fallen
the
previous
day
the
day
of
the
battle
reviewing
his
impressions
of
the
recent
battle
picturing
pleasantly
to
himself
the
impression
his
news
of
a
victory
would
create
or
recalling
the
send
off
given
him
by
the
commander
in
chief
and
his
fellow
officers
prince
andrew
was
galloping
along
in
a
post
chaise
enjoying
the
feelings
of
a
man
who
has
at
length
begun
to
attain
a
long
desired
happiness
as
soon
as
he
closed
his
eyes
his
ears
seemed
filled
with
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
and
the
sensation
of
victory
then
he
began
to
imagine
that
the
russians
were
running
away
and
that
he
himself
was
killed
but
he
quickly
roused
himself
with
a
feeling
of
joy
as
if
learning
afresh
that
this
was
not
so
but
that
on
the
contrary
the
french
had
run
away
he
again
recalled
all
the
details
of
the
victory
and
his
own
calm
courage
during
the
battle
and
feeling
reassured
he
dozed
off
the
dark
starry
night
was
followed
by
a
bright
cheerful
morning
the
snow
was
thawing
in
the
sunshine
the
horses
galloped
quickly
and
on
both
sides
of
the
road
were
forests
of
different
kinds
fields
and
villages
at
one
of
the
post
stations
he
overtook
a
convoy
of
russian
wounded
the
russian
officer
in
charge
of
the
transport
lolled
back
in
the
front
cart
shouting
and
scolding
a
soldier
with
coarse
abuse
in
each
of
the
long
german
carts
six
or
more
pale
dirty
bandaged
men
were
being
jolted
over
the
stony
road
some
of
them
were
talking
he
heard
russian
words
others
were
eating
bread
the
more
severely
wounded
looked
silently
with
the
languid
interest
of
sick
children
at
the
envoy
hurrying
past
them
prince
andrew
told
his
driver
to
stop
and
asked
a
soldier
in
what
action
they
had
been
wounded
day
before
yesterday
on
the
danube
answered
the
soldier
prince
andrew
took
out
his
purse
and
gave
the
soldier
three
gold
pieces
that
s
for
them
all
he
said
to
the
officer
who
came
up
get
well
soon
lads
he
continued
turning
to
the
soldiers
there
s
plenty
to
do
still
what
news
sir
asked
the
officer
evidently
anxious
to
start
a
conversation
good
news
go
on
he
shouted
to
the
driver
and
they
galloped
on
it
was
already
quite
dark
when
prince
andrew
rattled
over
the
paved
streets
of
brunn
and
found
himself
surrounded
by
high
buildings
the
lights
of
shops
houses
and
street
lamps
fine
carriages
and
all
that
atmosphere
of
a
large
and
active
town
which
is
always
so
attractive
to
a
soldier
after
camp
life
despite
his
rapid
journey
and
sleepless
night
prince
andrew
when
he
drove
up
to
the
palace
felt
even
more
vigorous
and
alert
than
he
had
done
the
day
before
only
his
eyes
gleamed
feverishly
and
his
thoughts
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
rapidity
he
again
vividly
recalled
the
details
of
the
battle
no
longer
dim
but
definite
and
in
the
concise
form
in
which
he
imagined
himself
stating
them
to
the
emperor
francis
he
vividly
imagined
the
casual
questions
that
might
be
put
to
him
and
the
answers
he
would
give
he
expected
to
be
at
once
presented
to
the
emperor
at
the
chief
entrance
to
the
palace
however
an
official
came
running
out
to
meet
him
and
learning
that
he
was
a
special
messenger
led
him
to
another
entrance
to
the
right
from
the
corridor
euer
hochgeboren
there
you
will
find
the
adjutant
on
duty
said
the
official
he
will
conduct
you
to
the
minister
of
war
the
adjutant
on
duty
meeting
prince
andrew
asked
him
to
wait
and
went
in
to
the
minister
of
war
five
minutes
later
he
returned
and
bowing
with
particular
courtesy
ushered
prince
andrew
before
him
along
a
corridor
to
the
cabinet
where
the
minister
of
war
was
at
work
the
adjutant
by
his
elaborate
courtesy
appeared
to
wish
to
ward
off
any
attempt
at
familiarity
on
the
part
of
the
russian
messenger
prince
andrew
s
joyous
feeling
was
considerably
weakened
as
he
approached
the
door
of
the
minister
s
room
he
felt
offended
and
without
his
noticing
it
the
feeling
of
offense
immediately
turned
into
one
of
disdain
which
was
quite
uncalled
for
his
fertile
mind
instantly
suggested
to
him
a
point
of
view
which
gave
him
a
right
to
despise
the
adjutant
and
the
minister
away
from
the
smell
of
powder
they
probably
think
it
easy
to
gain
victories
he
thought
his
eyes
narrowed
disdainfully
he
entered
the
room
of
the
minister
of
war
with
peculiarly
deliberate
steps
this
feeling
of
disdain
was
heightened
when
he
saw
the
minister
seated
at
a
large
table
reading
some
papers
and
making
pencil
notes
on
them
and
for
the
first
two
or
three
minutes
taking
no
notice
of
his
arrival
a
wax
candle
stood
at
each
side
of
the
minister
s
bent
bald
head
with
its
gray
temples
he
went
on
reading
to
the
end
without
raising
his
eyes
at
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
take
this
and
deliver
it
said
he
to
his
adjutant
handing
him
the
papers
and
still
taking
no
notice
of
the
special
messenger
prince
andrew
felt
that
either
the
actions
of
kutuzov
s
army
interested
the
minister
of
war
less
than
any
of
the
other
matters
he
was
concerned
with
or
he
wanted
to
give
the
russian
special
messenger
that
impression
but
that
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
he
thought
the
minister
drew
the
remaining
papers
together
arranged
them
evenly
and
then
raised
his
head
he
had
an
intellectual
and
distinctive
head
but
the
instant
he
turned
to
prince
andrew
the
firm
intelligent
expression
on
his
face
changed
in
a
way
evidently
deliberate
and
habitual
to
him
his
face
took
on
the
stupid
artificial
smile
which
does
not
even
attempt
to
hide
its
artificiality
of
a
man
who
is
continually
receiving
many
petitioners
one
after
another
from
general
field
marshal
kutuzov
he
asked
i
hope
it
is
good
news
there
has
been
an
encounter
with
mortier
a
victory
it
was
high
time
he
took
the
dispatch
which
was
addressed
to
him
and
began
to
read
it
with
a
mournful
expression
oh
my
god
my
god
schmidt
he
exclaimed
in
german
what
a
calamity
what
a
calamity
having
glanced
through
the
dispatch
he
laid
it
on
the
table
and
looked
at
prince
andrew
evidently
considering
something
ah
what
a
calamity
you
say
the
affair
was
decisive
but
mortier
is
not
captured
again
he
pondered
i
am
very
glad
you
have
brought
good
news
though
schmidt
s
death
is
a
heavy
price
to
pay
for
the
victory
his
majesty
will
no
doubt
wish
to
see
you
but
not
today
i
thank
you
you
must
have
a
rest
be
at
the
levee
tomorrow
after
the
parade
however
i
will
let
you
know
the
stupid
smile
which
had
left
his
face
while
he
was
speaking
reappeared
au
revoir
thank
you
very
much
his
majesty
will
probably
desire
to
see
you
he
added
bowing
his
head
when
prince
andrew
left
the
palace
he
felt
that
all
the
interest
and
happiness
the
victory
had
afforded
him
had
been
now
left
in
the
indifferent
hands
of
the
minister
of
war
and
the
polite
adjutant
the
whole
tenor
of
his
thoughts
instantaneously
changed
the
battle
seemed
the
memory
of
a
remote
event
long
past
chapter
x
prince
andrew
stayed
at
brunn
with
bilibin
a
russian
acquaintance
of
his
in
the
diplomatic
service
ah
my
dear
prince
i
could
not
have
a
more
welcome
visitor
said
bilibin
as
he
came
out
to
meet
prince
andrew
franz
put
the
prince
s
things
in
my
bedroom
said
he
to
the
servant
who
was
ushering
bolkonski
in
so
you
re
a
messenger
of
victory
eh
splendid
and
i
am
sitting
here
ill
as
you
see
after
washing
and
dressing
prince
andrew
came
into
the
diplomat
s
luxurious
study
and
sat
down
to
the
dinner
prepared
for
him
bilibin
settled
down
comfortably
beside
the
fire
after
his
journey
and
the
campaign
during
which
he
had
been
deprived
of
all
the
comforts
of
cleanliness
and
all
the
refinements
of
life
prince
andrew
felt
a
pleasant
sense
of
repose
among
luxurious
surroundings
such
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
from
childhood
besides
it
was
pleasant
after
his
reception
by
the
austrians
to
speak
if
not
in
russian
for
they
were
speaking
french
at
least
with
a
russian
who
would
he
supposed
share
the
general
russian
antipathy
to
the
austrians
which
was
then
particularly
strong
bilibin
was
a
man
of
thirty
five
a
bachelor
and
of
the
same
circle
as
prince
andrew
they
had
known
each
other
previously
in
petersburg
but
had
become
more
intimate
when
prince
andrew
was
in
vienna
with
kutuzov
just
as
prince
andrew
was
a
young
man
who
gave
promise
of
rising
high
in
the
military
profession
so
to
an
even
greater
extent
bilibin
gave
promise
of
rising
in
his
diplomatic
career
he
was
still
a
young
man
but
no
longer
a
young
diplomat
as
he
had
entered
the
service
at
the
age
of
sixteen
had
been
in
paris
and
copenhagen
and
now
held
a
rather
important
post
in
vienna
both
the
foreign
minister
and
our
ambassador
in
vienna
knew
him
and
valued
him
he
was
not
one
of
those
many
diplomats
who
are
esteemed
because
they
have
certain
negative
qualities
avoid
doing
certain
things
and
speak
french
he
was
one
of
those
who
liking
work
knew
how
to
do
it
and
despite
his
indolence
would
sometimes
spend
a
whole
night
at
his
writing
table
he
worked
well
whatever
the
import
of
his
work
it
was
not
the
question
what
for
but
the
question
how
that
interested
him
what
the
diplomatic
matter
might
be
he
did
not
care
but
it
gave
him
great
pleasure
to
prepare
a
circular
memorandum
or
report
skillfully
pointedly
and
elegantly
bilibin
s
services
were
valued
not
only
for
what
he
wrote
but
also
for
his
skill
in
dealing
and
conversing
with
those
in
the
highest
spheres
bilibin
liked
conversation
as
he
liked
work
only
when
it
could
be
made
elegantly
witty
in
society
he
always
awaited
an
opportunity
to
say
something
striking
and
took
part
in
a
conversation
only
when
that
was
possible
his
conversation
was
always
sprinkled
with
wittily
original
finished
phrases
of
general
interest
these
sayings
were
prepared
in
the
inner
laboratory
of
his
mind
in
a
portable
form
as
if
intentionally
so
that
insignificant
society
people
might
carry
them
from
drawing
room
to
drawing
room
and
in
fact
bilibin
s
witticisms
were
hawked
about
in
the
viennese
drawing
rooms
and
often
had
an
influence
on
matters
considered
important
his
thin
worn
sallow
face
was
covered
with
deep
wrinkles
which
always
looked
as
clean
and
well
washed
as
the
tips
of
one
s
fingers
after
a
russian
bath
the
movement
of
these
wrinkles
formed
the
principal
play
of
expression
on
his
face
now
his
forehead
would
pucker
into
deep
folds
and
his
eyebrows
were
lifted
then
his
eyebrows
would
descend
and
deep
wrinkles
would
crease
his
cheeks
his
small
deep
set
eyes
always
twinkled
and
looked
out
straight
well
now
tell
me
about
your
exploits
said
he
bolkonski
very
modestly
without
once
mentioning
himself
described
the
engagement
and
his
reception
by
the
minister
of
war
they
received
me
and
my
news
as
one
receives
a
dog
in
a
game
of
skittles
said
he
in
conclusion
bilibin
smiled
and
the
wrinkles
on
his
face
disappeared
cependant
mon
cher
he
remarked
examining
his
nails
from
a
distance
and
puckering
the
skin
above
his
left
eye
malgre
la
haute
estime
que
je
professe
pour
the
orthodox
russian
army
j
avoue
que
votre
victoire
n
est
pas
des
plus
victorieuses
but
my
dear
fellow
with
all
my
respect
for
the
orthodox
russian
army
i
must
say
that
your
victory
was
not
particularly
victorious
he
went
on
talking
in
this
way
in
french
uttering
only
those
words
in
russian
on
which
he
wished
to
put
a
contemptuous
emphasis
come
now
you
with
all
your
forces
fall
on
the
unfortunate
mortier
and
his
one
division
and
even
then
mortier
slips
through
your
fingers
where
s
the
victory
but
seriously
said
prince
andrew
we
can
at
any
rate
say
without
boasting
that
it
was
a
little
better
than
at
ulm
why
didn
t
you
capture
one
just
one
marshal
for
us
because
not
everything
happens
as
one
expects
or
with
the
smoothness
of
a
parade
we
had
expected
as
i
told
you
to
get
at
their
rear
by
seven
in
the
morning
but
had
not
reached
it
by
five
in
the
afternoon
and
why
didn
t
you
do
it
at
seven
in
the
morning
you
ought
to
have
been
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
returned
bilibin
with
a
smile
you
ought
to
have
been
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
why
did
you
not
succeed
in
impressing
on
bonaparte
by
diplomatic
methods
that
he
had
better
leave
genoa
alone
retorted
prince
andrew
in
the
same
tone
i
know
interrupted
bilibin
you
re
thinking
it
s
very
easy
to
take
marshals
sitting
on
a
sofa
by
the
fire
that
is
true
but
still
why
didn
t
you
capture
him
so
don
t
be
surprised
if
not
only
the
minister
of
war
but
also
his
most
august
majesty
the
emperor
and
king
francis
is
not
much
delighted
by
your
victory
even
i
a
poor
secretary
of
the
russian
embassy
do
not
feel
any
need
in
token
of
my
joy
to
give
my
franz
a
thaler
or
let
him
go
with
his
liebchen
to
the
prater
true
we
have
no
prater
here
he
looked
straight
at
prince
andrew
and
suddenly
unwrinkled
his
forehead
it
is
now
my
turn
to
ask
you
why
mon
cher
said
bolkonski
i
confess
i
do
not
understand
perhaps
there
are
diplomatic
subtleties
here
beyond
my
feeble
intelligence
but
i
can
t
make
it
out
mack
loses
a
whole
army
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
the
archduke
karl
give
no
signs
of
life
and
make
blunder
after
blunder
kutuzov
alone
at
last
gains
a
real
victory
destroying
the
spell
of
the
invincibility
of
the
french
and
the
minister
of
war
does
not
even
care
to
hear
the
details
that
s
just
it
my
dear
fellow
you
see
it
s
hurrah
for
the
tsar
for
russia
for
the
orthodox
greek
faith
all
that
is
beautiful
but
what
do
we
i
mean
the
austrian
court
care
for
your
victories
bring
us
nice
news
of
a
victory
by
the
archduke
karl
or
ferdinand
one
archduke
s
as
good
as
another
as
you
know
and
even
if
it
is
only
over
a
fire
brigade
of
bonaparte
s
that
will
be
another
story
and
we
ll
fire
off
some
cannon
but
this
sort
of
thing
seems
done
on
purpose
to
vex
us
the
archduke
karl
does
nothing
the
archduke
ferdinand
disgraces
himself
you
abandon
vienna
give
up
its
defense
as
much
as
to
say
heaven
is
with
us
but
heaven
help
you
and
your
capital
the
one
general
whom
we
all
loved
schmidt
you
expose
to
a
bullet
and
then
you
congratulate
us
on
the
victory
admit
that
more
irritating
news
than
yours
could
not
have
been
conceived
it
s
as
if
it
had
been
done
on
purpose
on
purpose
besides
suppose
you
did
gain
a
brilliant
victory
if
even
the
archduke
karl
gained
a
victory
what
effect
would
that
have
on
the
general
course
of
events
it
s
too
late
now
when
vienna
is
occupied
by
the
french
army
what
occupied
vienna
occupied
not
only
occupied
but
bonaparte
is
at
schonbrunn
and
the
count
our
dear
count
vrbna
goes
to
him
for
orders
after
the
fatigues
and
impressions
of
the
journey
his
reception
and
especially
after
having
dined
bolkonski
felt
that
he
could
not
take
in
the
full
significance
of
the
words
he
heard
count
lichtenfels
was
here
this
morning
bilibin
continued
and
showed
me
a
letter
in
which
the
parade
of
the
french
in
vienna
was
fully
described
prince
murat
et
tout
le
tremblement
you
see
that
your
victory
is
not
a
matter
for
great
rejoicing
and
that
you
can
t
be
received
as
a
savior
really
i
don
t
care
about
that
i
don
t
care
at
all
said
prince
andrew
beginning
to
understand
that
his
news
of
the
battle
before
krems
was
really
of
small
importance
in
view
of
such
events
as
the
fall
of
austria
s
capital
how
is
it
vienna
was
taken
what
of
the
bridge
and
its
celebrated
bridgehead
and
prince
auersperg
we
heard
reports
that
prince
auersperg
was
defending
vienna
he
said
prince
auersperg
is
on
this
on
our
side
of
the
river
and
is
defending
us
doing
it
very
badly
i
think
but
still
he
is
defending
us
but
vienna
is
on
the
other
side
no
the
bridge
has
not
yet
been
taken
and
i
hope
it
will
not
be
for
it
is
mined
and
orders
have
been
given
to
blow
it
up
otherwise
we
should
long
ago
have
been
in
the
mountains
of
bohemia
and
you
and
your
army
would
have
spent
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
between
two
fires
but
still
this
does
not
mean
that
the
campaign
is
over
said
prince
andrew
well
i
think
it
is
the
bigwigs
here
think
so
too
but
they
daren
t
say
so
it
will
be
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
it
won
t
be
your
skirmishing
at
durrenstein
or
gunpowder
at
all
that
will
decide
the
matter
but
those
who
devised
it
said
bilibin
quoting
one
of
his
own
mots
releasing
the
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
and
pausing
the
only
question
is
what
will
come
of
the
meeting
between
the
emperor
alexander
and
the
king
of
prussia
in
berlin
if
prussia
joins
the
allies
austria
s
hand
will
be
forced
and
there
will
be
war
if
not
it
is
merely
a
question
of
settling
where
the
preliminaries
of
the
new
campo
formio
are
to
be
drawn
up
what
an
extraordinary
genius
prince
andrew
suddenly
exclaimed
clenching
his
small
hand
and
striking
the
table
with
it
and
what
luck
the
man
has
buonaparte
said
bilibin
inquiringly
puckering
up
his
forehead
to
indicate
that
he
was
about
to
say
something
witty
buonaparte
he
repeated
accentuating
the
u
i
think
however
now
that
he
lays
down
laws
for
austria
at
schonbrunn
il
faut
lui
faire
grace
de
l
u
i
shall
certainly
adopt
an
innovation
and
call
him
simply
bonaparte
we
must
let
him
off
the
u
but
joking
apart
said
prince
andrew
do
you
really
think
the
campaign
is
over
this
is
what
i
think
austria
has
been
made
a
fool
of
and
she
is
not
used
to
it
she
will
retaliate
and
she
has
been
fooled
in
the
first
place
because
her
provinces
have
been
pillaged
they
say
the
holy
russian
army
loots
terribly
her
army
is
destroyed
her
capital
taken
and
all
this
for
the
beaux
yeux
of
his
sardinian
majesty
and
therefore
this
is
between
ourselves
i
instinctively
feel
that
we
are
being
deceived
my
instinct
tells
me
of
negotiations
with
france
and
projects
for
peace
a
secret
peace
concluded
separately
fine
eyes
impossible
cried
prince
andrew
that
would
be
too
base
if
we
live
we
shall
see
replied
bilibin
his
face
again
becoming
smooth
as
a
sign
that
the
conversation
was
at
an
end
when
prince
andrew
reached
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
lay
down
in
a
clean
shirt
on
the
feather
bed
with
its
warmed
and
fragrant
pillows
he
felt
that
the
battle
of
which
he
had
brought
tidings
was
far
far
away
from
him
the
alliance
with
prussia
austria
s
treachery
bonaparte
s
new
triumph
tomorrow
s
levee
and
parade
and
the
audience
with
the
emperor
francis
occupied
his
thoughts
he
closed
his
eyes
and
immediately
a
sound
of
cannonading
of
musketry
and
the
rattling
of
carriage
wheels
seemed
to
fill
his
ears
and
now
again
drawn
out
in
a
thin
line
the
musketeers
were
descending
the
hill
the
french
were
firing
and
he
felt
his
heart
palpitating
as
he
rode
forward
beside
schmidt
with
the
bullets
merrily
whistling
all
around
and
he
experienced
tenfold
the
joy
of
living
as
he
had
not
done
since
childhood
he
woke
up
yes
that
all
happened
he
said
and
smiling
happily
to
himself
like
a
child
he
fell
into
a
deep
youthful
slumber
chapter
xi
next
day
he
woke
late
recalling
his
recent
impressions
the
first
thought
that
came
into
his
mind
was
that
today
he
had
to
be
presented
to
the
emperor
francis
he
remembered
the
minister
of
war
the
polite
austrian
adjutant
bilibin
and
last
night
s
conversation
having
dressed
for
his
attendance
at
court
in
full
parade
uniform
which
he
had
not
worn
for
a
long
time
he
went
into
bilibin
s
study
fresh
animated
and
handsome
with
his
hand
bandaged
in
the
study
were
four
gentlemen
of
the
diplomatic
corps
with
prince
hippolyte
kuragin
who
was
a
secretary
to
the
embassy
bolkonski
was
already
acquainted
bilibin
introduced
him
to
the
others
the
gentlemen
assembled
at
bilibin
s
were
young
wealthy
gay
society
men
who
here
as
in
vienna
formed
a
special
set
which
bilibin
their
leader
called
les
notres
this
set
consisting
almost
exclusively
of
diplomats
evidently
had
its
own
interests
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
war
or
politics
but
related
to
high
society
to
certain
women
and
to
the
official
side
of
the
service
these
gentlemen
received
prince
andrew
as
one
of
themselves
an
honor
they
did
not
extend
to
many
from
politeness
and
to
start
conversation
they
asked
him
a
few
questions
about
the
army
and
the
battle
and
then
the
talk
went
off
into
merry
jests
and
gossip
ours
but
the
best
of
it
was
said
one
telling
of
the
misfortune
of
a
fellow
diplomat
that
the
chancellor
told
him
flatly
that
his
appointment
to
london
was
a
promotion
and
that
he
was
so
to
regard
it
can
you
fancy
the
figure
he
cut
but
the
worst
of
it
gentlemen
i
am
giving
kuragin
away
to
you
is
that
that
man
suffers
and
this
don
juan
wicked
fellow
is
taking
advantage
of
it
prince
hippolyte
was
lolling
in
a
lounge
chair
with
his
legs
over
its
arm
he
began
to
laugh
tell
me
about
that
he
said
oh
you
don
juan
you
serpent
cried
several
voices
you
bolkonski
don
t
know
said
bilibin
turning
to
prince
andrew
that
all
the
atrocities
of
the
french
army
i
nearly
said
of
the
russian
army
are
nothing
compared
to
what
this
man
has
been
doing
among
the
women
la
femme
est
la
compagne
de
l
homme
announced
prince
hippolyte
and
began
looking
through
a
lorgnette
at
his
elevated
legs
woman
is
man
s
companion
bilibin
and
the
rest
of
ours
burst
out
laughing
in
hippolyte
s
face
and
prince
andrew
saw
that
hippolyte
of
whom
he
had
to
admit
he
had
almost
been
jealous
on
his
wife
s
account
was
the
butt
of
this
set
oh
i
must
give
you
a
treat
bilibin
whispered
to
bolkonski
kuragin
is
exquisite
when
he
discusses
politics
you
should
see
his
gravity
he
sat
down
beside
hippolyte
and
wrinkling
his
forehead
began
talking
to
him
about
politics
prince
andrew
and
the
others
gathered
round
these
two
the
berlin
cabinet
cannot
express
a
feeling
of
alliance
began
hippolyte
gazing
round
with
importance
at
the
others
without
expressing
as
in
its
last
note
you
understand
besides
unless
his
majesty
the
emperor
derogates
from
the
principle
of
our
alliance
wait
i
have
not
finished
he
said
to
prince
andrew
seizing
him
by
the
arm
i
believe
that
intervention
will
be
stronger
than
nonintervention
and
he
paused
finally
one
cannot
impute
the
nonreceipt
of
our
dispatch
of
november
that
is
how
it
will
end
and
he
released
bolkonski
s
arm
to
indicate
that
he
had
now
quite
finished
demosthenes
i
know
thee
by
the
pebble
thou
secretest
in
thy
golden
mouth
said
bilibin
and
the
mop
of
hair
on
his
head
moved
with
satisfaction
everybody
laughed
and
hippolyte
louder
than
anyone
he
was
evidently
distressed
and
breathed
painfully
but
could
not
restrain
the
wild
laughter
that
convulsed
his
usually
impassive
features
well
now
gentlemen
said
bilibin
bolkonski
is
my
guest
in
this
house
and
in
brunn
itself
i
want
to
entertain
him
as
far
as
i
can
with
all
the
pleasures
of
life
here
if
we
were
in
vienna
it
would
be
easy
but
here
in
this
wretched
moravian
hole
it
is
more
difficult
and
i
beg
you
all
to
help
me
brunn
s
attractions
must
be
shown
him
you
can
undertake
the
theater
i
society
and
you
hippolyte
of
course
the
women
we
must
let
him
see
amelie
she
s
exquisite
said
one
of
ours
kissing
his
finger
tips
in
general
we
must
turn
this
bloodthirsty
soldier
to
more
humane
interests
said
bilibin
i
shall
scarcely
be
able
to
avail
myself
of
your
hospitality
gentlemen
it
is
already
time
for
me
to
go
replied
prince
andrew
looking
at
his
watch
where
to
to
the
emperor
oh
oh
oh
well
au
revoir
bolkonski
au
revoir
prince
come
back
early
to
dinner
cried
several
voices
we
ll
take
you
in
hand
when
speaking
to
the
emperor
try
as
far
as
you
can
to
praise
the
way
that
provisions
are
supplied
and
the
routes
indicated
said
bilibin
accompanying
him
to
the
hall
i
should
like
to
speak
well
of
them
but
as
far
as
i
know
the
facts
i
can
t
replied
bolkonski
smiling
well
talk
as
much
as
you
can
anyway
he
has
a
passion
for
giving
audiences
but
he
does
not
like
talking
himself
and
can
t
do
it
as
you
will
see
chapter
xii
at
the
levee
prince
andrew
stood
among
the
austrian
officers
as
he
had
been
told
to
and
the
emperor
francis
merely
looked
fixedly
into
his
face
and
just
nodded
to
him
with
his
long
head
but
after
it
was
over
the
adjutant
he
had
seen
the
previous
day
ceremoniously
informed
bolkonski
that
the
emperor
desired
to
give
him
an
audience
the
emperor
francis
received
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
before
the
conversation
began
prince
andrew
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
emperor
seemed
confused
and
blushed
as
if
not
knowing
what
to
say
tell
me
when
did
the
battle
begin
he
asked
hurriedly
prince
andrew
replied
then
followed
other
questions
just
as
simple
was
kutuzov
well
when
had
he
left
krems
and
so
on
the
emperor
spoke
as
if
his
sole
aim
were
to
put
a
given
number
of
questions
the
answers
to
these
questions
as
was
only
too
evident
did
not
interest
him
at
what
o
clock
did
the
battle
begin
asked
the
emperor
i
cannot
inform
your
majesty
at
what
o
clock
the
battle
began
at
the
front
but
at
durrenstein
where
i
was
our
attack
began
after
five
in
the
afternoon
replied
bolkonski
growing
more
animated
and
expecting
that
he
would
have
a
chance
to
give
a
reliable
account
which
he
had
ready
in
his
mind
of
all
he
knew
and
had
seen
but
the
emperor
smiled
and
interrupted
him
how
many
miles
from
where
to
where
your
majesty
from
durrenstein
to
krems
three
and
a
half
miles
your
majesty

according
to
the
scouts

last
of
them
crossed
on
rafts
during
the
night
is
there
sufficient
forage
in
krems
forage
has
not
been
supplied
to
the
extent
the
emperor
interrupted
him
at
what
o
clock
was
general
schmidt
killed
at
seven
o
clock
i
believe
at
seven
o
clock
it
s
very
sad
very
sad
the
emperor
thanked
prince
andrew
and
bowed
prince
andrew
withdrew
and
was
immediately
surrounded
by
courtiers
on
all
sides
everywhere
he
saw
friendly
looks
and
heard
friendly
words
yesterday
s
adjutant
reproached
him
for
not
having
stayed
at
the
palace
and
offered
him
his
own
house
the
minister
of
war
came
up
and
congratulated
him
on
the
maria
theresa
order
of
the
third
grade
which
the
emperor
was
conferring
on
him
the
empress
chamberlain
invited
him
to
see
her
majesty
the
archduchess
also
wished
to
see
him
he
did
not
know
whom
to
answer
and
for
a
few
seconds
collected
his
thoughts
then
the
russian
ambassador
took
him
by
the
shoulder
led
him
to
the
window
and
began
to
talk
to
him
contrary
to
bilibin
s
forecast
the
news
he
had
brought
was
joyfully
received
a
thanksgiving
service
was
arranged
kutuzov
was
awarded
the
grand
cross
of
maria
theresa
and
the
whole
army
received
rewards
bolkonski
was
invited
everywhere
and
had
to
spend
the
whole
morning
calling
on
the
principal
austrian
dignitaries
between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
having
made
all
his
calls
he
was
returning
to
bilibin
s
house
thinking
out
a
letter
to
his
father
about
the
battle
and
his
visit
to
brunn
at
the
door
he
found
a
vehicle
half
full
of
luggage
franz
bilibin
s
man
was
dragging
a
portmanteau
with
some
difficulty
out
of
the
front
door
before
returning
to
bilibin
s
prince
andrew
had
gone
to
a
bookshop
to
provide
himself
with
some
books
for
the
campaign
and
had
spent
some
time
in
the
shop
what
is
it
he
asked
oh
your
excellency
said
franz
with
difficulty
rolling
the
portmanteau
into
the
vehicle
we
are
to
move
on
still
farther
the
scoundrel
is
again
at
our
heels
eh
what
asked
prince
andrew
bilibin
came
out
to
meet
him
his
usually
calm
face
showed
excitement
there
now
confess
that
this
is
delightful
said
he
this
affair
of
the
thabor
bridge
at
vienna
they
have
crossed
without
striking
a
blow
prince
andrew
could
not
understand
but
where
do
you
come
from
not
to
know
what
every
coachman
in
the
town
knows
i
come
from
the
archduchess
i
heard
nothing
there
and
you
didn
t
see
that
everybody
is
packing
up
i
did
not
what
is
it
all
about
inquired
prince
andrew
impatiently
what
s
it
all
about
why
the
french
have
crossed
the
bridge
that
auersperg
was
defending
and
the
bridge
was
not
blown
up
so
murat
is
now
rushing
along
the
road
to
brunn
and
will
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
what
here
but
why
did
they
not
blow
up
the
bridge
if
it
was
mined
that
is
what
i
ask
you
no
one
not
even
bonaparte
knows
why
bolkonski
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
if
the
bridge
is
crossed
it
means
that
the
army
too
is
lost
it
will
be
cut
off
said
he
that
s
just
it
answered
bilibin
listen
the
french
entered
vienna
as
i
told
you
very
well
next
day
which
was
yesterday
those
gentlemen
messieurs
les
marechaux
murat
lannes
and
belliard
mount
and
ride
to
the
bridge
observe
that
all
three
are
gascons
gentlemen
says
one
of
them
you
know
the
thabor
bridge
is
mined
and
doubly
mined
and
that
there
are
menacing
fortifications
at
its
head
and
an
army
of
fifteen
thousand
men
has
been
ordered
to
blow
up
the
bridge
and
not
let
us
cross
but
it
will
please
our
sovereign
the
emperor
napoleon
if
we
take
this
bridge
so
let
us
three
go
and
take
it
yes
let
s
say
the
others
and
off
they
go
and
take
the
bridge
cross
it
and
now
with
their
whole
army
are
on
this
side
of
the
danube
marching
on
us
you
and
your
lines
of
communication
the
marshalls
stop
jesting
said
prince
andrew
sadly
and
seriously
this
news
grieved
him
and
yet
he
was
pleased
as
soon
as
he
learned
that
the
russian
army
was
in
such
a
hopeless
situation
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
was
destined
to
lead
it
out
of
this
position
that
here
was
the
toulon
that
would
lift
him
from
the
ranks
of
obscure
officers
and
offer
him
the
first
step
to
fame
listening
to
bilibin
he
was
already
imagining
how
on
reaching
the
army
he
would
give
an
opinion
at
the
war
council
which
would
be
the
only
one
that
could
save
the
army
and
how
he
alone
would
be
entrusted
with
the
executing
of
the
plan
stop
this
jesting
he
said
i
am
not
jesting
bilibin
went
on
nothing
is
truer
or
sadder
these
gentlemen
ride
onto
the
bridge
alone
and
wave
white
handkerchiefs
they
assure
the
officer
on
duty
that
they
the
marshals
are
on
their
way
to
negotiate
with
prince
auersperg
he
lets
them
enter
the
tete
de
pont
they
spin
him
a
thousand
gasconades
saying
that
the
war
is
over
that
the
emperor
francis
is
arranging
a
meeting
with
bonaparte
that
they
desire
to
see
prince
auersperg
and
so
on
the
officer
sends
for
auersperg
these
gentlemen
embrace
the
officers
crack
jokes
sit
on
the
cannon
and
meanwhile
a
french
battalion
gets
to
the
bridge
unobserved
flings
the
bags
of
incendiary
material
into
the
water
and
approaches
the
tete
de
pont
at
length
appears
the
lieutenant
general
our
dear
prince
auersperg
von
mautern
himself
dearest
foe
flower
of
the
austrian
army
hero
of
the
turkish
wars
hostilities
are
ended
we
can
shake
one
another
s
hand
the
emperor
napoleon
burns
with
impatience
to
make
prince
auersperg
s
acquaintance
in
a
word
those
gentlemen
gascons
indeed
so
bewildered
him
with
fine
words
and
he
is
so
flattered
by
his
rapidly
established
intimacy
with
the
french
marshals
and
so
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
murat
s
mantle
and
ostrich
plumes
qu
il
n
y
voit
que
du
feu
et
oublie
celui
qu
il
devait
faire
faire
sur
l
ennemi
in
spite
of
the
animation
of
his
speech
bilibin
did
not
forget
to
pause
after
this
mot
to
give
time
for
its
due
appreciation
the
french
battalion
rushes
to
the
bridgehead
spikes
the
guns
and
the
bridge
is
taken
but
what
is
best
of
all
he
went
on
his
excitement
subsiding
under
the
delightful
interest
of
his
own
story
is
that
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
cannon
which
was
to
give
the
signal
to
fire
the
mines
and
blow
up
the
bridge
this
sergeant
seeing
that
the
french
troops
were
running
onto
the
bridge
was
about
to
fire
but
lannes
stayed
his
hand
the
sergeant
who
was
evidently
wiser
than
his
general
goes
up
to
auersperg
and
says
prince
you
are
being
deceived
here
are
the
french
murat
seeing
that
all
is
lost
if
the
sergeant
is
allowed
to
speak
turns
to
auersperg
with
feigned
astonishment
he
is
a
true
gascon
and
says
i
don
t
recognize
the
world
famous
austrian
discipline
if
you
allow
a
subordinate
to
address
you
like
that
it
was
a
stroke
of
genius
prince
auersperg
feels
his
dignity
at
stake
and
orders
the
sergeant
to
be
arrested
come
you
must
own
that
this
affair
of
the
thabor
bridge
is
delightful
it
is
not
exactly
stupidity
nor
rascality
bridgehead
that
their
fire
gets
into
his
eyes
and
he
forgets
that
he
ought
to
be
firing
at
the
enemy
it
may
be
treachery
said
prince
andrew
vividly
imagining
the
gray
overcoats
wounds
the
smoke
of
gunpowder
the
sounds
of
firing
and
the
glory
that
awaited
him
not
that
either
that
puts
the
court
in
too
bad
a
light
replied
bilibin
it
s
not
treachery
nor
rascality
nor
stupidity
it
is
just
as
at
ulm
it
is
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
find
the
right
expression
c
est
c
est
du
mack
nous
sommes
mackes
it
is
it
is
a
bit
of
mack
we
are
macked
he
concluded
feeling
that
he
had
produced
a
good
epigram
a
fresh
one
that
would
be
repeated
his
hitherto
puckered
brow
became
smooth
as
a
sign
of
pleasure
and
with
a
slight
smile
he
began
to
examine
his
nails
where
are
you
off
to
he
said
suddenly
to
prince
andrew
who
had
risen
and
was
going
toward
his
room
i
am
going
away
where
to
to
the
army
but
you
meant
to
stay
another
two
days
but
now
i
am
off
at
once
and
prince
andrew
after
giving
directions
about
his
departure
went
to
his
room
do
you
know
mon
cher
said
bilibin
following
him
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
why
are
you
going
and
in
proof
of
the
conclusiveness
of
his
opinion
all
the
wrinkles
vanished
from
his
face
prince
andrew
looked
inquiringly
at
him
and
gave
no
reply
why
are
you
going
i
know
you
think
it
your
duty
to
gallop
back
to
the
army
now
that
it
is
in
danger
i
understand
that
mon
cher
it
is
heroism
not
at
all
said
prince
andrew
but
as
you
are
a
philosopher
be
a
consistent
one
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
question
and
you
will
see
that
your
duty
on
the
contrary
is
to
take
care
of
yourself
leave
it
to
those
who
are
no
longer
fit
for
anything
else
you
have
not
been
ordered
to
return
and
have
not
been
dismissed
from
here
therefore
you
can
stay
and
go
with
us
wherever
our
ill
luck
takes
us
they
say
we
are
going
to
olmutz
and
olmutz
is
a
very
decent
town
you
and
i
will
travel
comfortably
in
my
caleche
do
stop
joking
bilibin
cried
bolkonski
i
am
speaking
sincerely
as
a
friend
consider
where
and
why
are
you
going
when
you
might
remain
here
you
are
faced
by
one
of
two
things
and
the
skin
over
his
left
temple
puckered
either
you
will
not
reach
your
regiment
before
peace
is
concluded
or
you
will
share
defeat
and
disgrace
with
kutuzov
s
whole
army
and
bilibin
unwrinkled
his
temple
feeling
that
the
dilemma
was
insoluble
i
cannot
argue
about
it
replied
prince
andrew
coldly
but
he
thought
i
am
going
to
save
the
army
my
dear
fellow
you
are
a
hero
said
bilibin
chapter
xiii
that
same
night
having
taken
leave
of
the
minister
of
war
bolkonski
set
off
to
rejoin
the
army
not
knowing
where
he
would
find
it
and
fearing
to
be
captured
by
the
french
on
the
way
to
krems
in
brunn
everybody
attached
to
the
court
was
packing
up
and
the
heavy
baggage
was
already
being
dispatched
to
olmutz
near
hetzelsdorf
prince
andrew
struck
the
high
road
along
which
the
russian
army
was
moving
with
great
haste
and
in
the
greatest
disorder
the
road
was
so
obstructed
with
carts
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
by
in
a
carriage
prince
andrew
took
a
horse
and
a
cossack
from
a
cossack
commander
and
hungry
and
weary
making
his
way
past
the
baggage
wagons
rode
in
search
of
the
commander
in
chief
and
of
his
own
luggage
very
sinister
reports
of
the
position
of
the
army
reached
him
as
he
went
along
and
the
appearance
of
the
troops
in
their
disorderly
flight
confirmed
these
rumors
cette
armee
russe
que
l
or
de
l
angleterre
a
transportee
des
extremites
de
l
univers
nous
allons
lui
faire
eprouver
le
meme
sort
le
sort
de
l
armee
d
ulm
he
remembered
these
words
in
bonaparte
s
address
to
his
army
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
and
they
awoke
in
him
astonishment
at
the
genius
of
his
hero
a
feeling
of
wounded
pride
and
a
hope
of
glory
and
should
there
be
nothing
left
but
to
die
he
thought
well
if
need
be
i
shall
do
it
no
worse
than
others
that
russian
army
which
has
been
brought
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
by
english
gold
we
shall
cause
to
share
the
same
fate
the
fate
of
the
army
at
ulm
he
looked
with
disdain
at
the
endless
confused
mass
of
detachments
carts
guns
artillery
and
again
baggage
wagons
and
vehicles
of
all
kinds
overtaking
one
another
and
blocking
the
muddy
road
three
and
sometimes
four
abreast
from
all
sides
behind
and
before
as
far
as
ear
could
reach
there
were
the
rattle
of
wheels
the
creaking
of
carts
and
gun
carriages
the
tramp
of
horses
the
crack
of
whips
shouts
the
urging
of
horses
and
the
swearing
of
soldiers
orderlies
and
officers
all
along
the
sides
of
the
road
fallen
horses
were
to
be
seen
some
flayed
some
not
and
broken
down
carts
beside
which
solitary
soldiers
sat
waiting
for
something
and
again
soldiers
straggling
from
their
companies
crowds
of
whom
set
off
to
the
neighboring
villages
or
returned
from
them
dragging
sheep
fowls
hay
and
bulging
sacks
at
each
ascent
or
descent
of
the
road
the
crowds
were
yet
denser
and
the
din
of
shouting
more
incessant
soldiers
floundering
knee
deep
in
mud
pushed
the
guns
and
wagons
themselves
whips
cracked
hoofs
slipped
traces
broke
and
lungs
were
strained
with
shouting
the
officers
directing
the
march
rode
backward
and
forward
between
the
carts
their
voices
were
but
feebly
heard
amid
the
uproar
and
one
saw
by
their
faces
that
they
despaired
of
the
possibility
of
checking
this
disorder
here
is
our
dear
orthodox
russian
army
thought
bolkonski
recalling
bilibin
s
words
wishing
to
find
out
where
the
commander
in
chief
was
he
rode
up
to
a
convoy
directly
opposite
to
him
came
a
strange
one
horse
vehicle
evidently
rigged
up
by
soldiers
out
of
any
available
materials
and
looking
like
something
between
a
cart
a
cabriolet
and
a
caleche
a
soldier
was
driving
and
a
woman
enveloped
in
shawls
sat
behind
the
apron
under
the
leather
hood
of
the
vehicle
prince
andrew
rode
up
and
was
just
putting
his
question
to
a
soldier
when
his
attention
was
diverted
by
the
desperate
shrieks
of
the
woman
in
the
vehicle
an
officer
in
charge
of
transport
was
beating
the
soldier
who
was
driving
the
woman
s
vehicle
for
trying
to
get
ahead
of
others
and
the
strokes
of
his
whip
fell
on
the
apron
of
the
equipage
the
woman
screamed
piercingly
seeing
prince
andrew
she
leaned
out
from
behind
the
apron
and
waving
her
thin
arms
from
under
the
woolen
shawl
cried
mr
aide
de
camp
mr
aide
de
camp
for
heaven
s
sake
protect
me
what
will
become
of
us
i
am
the
wife
of
the
doctor
of
the
seventh
chasseurs
they
won
t
let
us
pass
we
are
left
behind
and
have
lost
our
people
i
ll
flatten
you
into
a
pancake
shouted
the
angry
officer
to
the
soldier
turn
back
with
your
slut
mr
aide
de
camp
help
me
what
does
it
all
mean
screamed
the
doctor
s
wife
kindly
let
this
cart
pass
don
t
you
see
it
s
a
woman
said
prince
andrew
riding
up
to
the
officer
the
officer
glanced
at
him
and
without
replying
turned
again
to
the
soldier
i
ll
teach
you
to
push
on
back
let
them
pass
i
tell
you
repeated
prince
andrew
compressing
his
lips
and
who
are
you
cried
the
officer
turning
on
him
with
tipsy
rage
who
are
you
are
you
in
command
here
eh
i
am
commander
here
not
you
go
back
or
i
ll
flatten
you
into
a
pancake
repeated
he
this
expression
evidently
pleased
him
that
was
a
nice
snub
for
the
little
aide
de
camp
came
a
voice
from
behind
prince
andrew
saw
that
the
officer
was
in
that
state
of
senseless
tipsy
rage
when
a
man
does
not
know
what
he
is
saying
he
saw
that
his
championship
of
the
doctor
s
wife
in
her
queer
trap
might
expose
him
to
what
he
dreaded
more
than
anything
in
the
world
to
ridicule
but
his
instinct
urged
him
on
before
the
officer
finished
his
sentence
prince
andrew
his
face
distorted
with
fury
rode
up
to
him
and
raised
his
riding
whip
kind
ly
let
them
pass
the
officer
flourished
his
arm
and
hastily
rode
away
it
s
all
the
fault
of
these
fellows
on
the
staff
that
there
s
this
disorder
he
muttered
do
as
you
like
prince
andrew
without
lifting
his
eyes
rode
hastily
away
from
the
doctor
s
wife
who
was
calling
him
her
deliverer
and
recalling
with
a
sense
of
disgust
the
minutest
details
of
this
humiliating
scene
he
galloped
on
to
the
village
where
he
was
told
that
the
commander
in
chief
was
on
reaching
the
village
he
dismounted
and
went
to
the
nearest
house
intending
to
rest
if
but
for
a
moment
eat
something
and
try
to
sort
out
the
stinging
and
tormenting
thoughts
that
confused
his
mind
this
is
a
mob
of
scoundrels
and
not
an
army
he
was
thinking
as
he
went
up
to
the
window
of
the
first
house
when
a
familiar
voice
called
him
by
name
he
turned
round
nesvitski
s
handsome
face
looked
out
of
the
little
window
nesvitski
moving
his
moist
lips
as
he
chewed
something
and
flourishing
his
arm
called
him
to
enter
bolkonski
bolkonski
don
t
you
hear
eh
come
quick
he
shouted
entering
the
house
prince
andrew
saw
nesvitski
and
another
adjutant
having
something
to
eat
they
hastily
turned
round
to
him
asking
if
he
had
any
news
on
their
familiar
faces
he
read
agitation
and
alarm
this
was
particularly
noticeable
on
nesvitski
s
usually
laughing
countenance
where
is
the
commander
in
chief
asked
bolkonski
here
in
that
house
answered
the
adjutant
well
is
it
true
that
it
s
peace
and
capitulation
asked
nesvitski
i
was
going
to
ask
you
i
know
nothing
except
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
here
and
we
my
dear
boy
it
s
terrible
i
was
wrong
to
laugh
at
mack
we
re
getting
it
still
worse
said
nesvitski
but
sit
down
and
have
something
to
eat
you
won
t
be
able
to
find
either
your
baggage
or
anything
else
now
prince
and
god
only
knows
where
your
man
peter
is
said
the
other
adjutant
where
are
headquarters
we
are
to
spend
the
night
in
znaim
well
i
have
got
all
i
need
into
packs
for
two
horses
said
nesvitski
they
ve
made
up
splendid
packs
for
me
fit
to
cross
the
bohemian
mountains
with
it
s
a
bad
lookout
old
fellow
but
what
s
the
matter
with
you
you
must
be
ill
to
shiver
like
that
he
added
noticing
that
prince
andrew
winced
as
at
an
electric
shock
it
s
nothing
replied
prince
andrew
he
had
just
remembered
his
recent
encounter
with
the
doctor
s
wife
and
the
convoy
officer
what
is
the
commander
in
chief
doing
here
he
asked
i
can
t
make
out
at
all
said
nesvitski
well
all
i
can
make
out
is
that
everything
is
abominable
abominable
quite
abominable
said
prince
andrew
and
he
went
off
to
the
house
where
the
commander
in
chief
was
passing
by
kutuzov
s
carriage
and
the
exhausted
saddle
horses
of
his
suite
with
their
cossacks
who
were
talking
loudly
together
prince
andrew
entered
the
passage
kutuzov
himself
he
was
told
was
in
the
house
with
prince
bagration
and
weyrother
weyrother
was
the
austrian
general
who
had
succeeded
schmidt
in
the
passage
little
kozlovski
was
squatting
on
his
heels
in
front
of
a
clerk
the
clerk
with
cuffs
turned
up
was
hastily
writing
at
a
tub
turned
bottom
upwards
kozlovski
s
face
looked
worn
he
too
had
evidently
not
slept
all
night
he
glanced
at
prince
andrew
and
did
not
even
nod
to
him
second
line
have
you
written
it
he
continued
dictating
to
the
clerk
the
kiev
grenadiers
podolian
one
can
t
write
so
fast
your
honor
said
the
clerk
glancing
angrily
and
disrespectfully
at
kozlovski
through
the
door
came
the
sounds
of
kutuzov
s
voice
excited
and
dissatisfied
interrupted
by
another
an
unfamiliar
voice
from
the
sound
of
these
voices
the
inattentive
way
kozlovski
looked
at
him
the
disrespectful
manner
of
the
exhausted
clerk
the
fact
that
the
clerk
and
kozlovski
were
squatting
on
the
floor
by
a
tub
so
near
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
from
the
noisy
laughter
of
the
cossacks
holding
the
horses
near
the
window
prince
andrew
felt
that
something
important
and
disastrous
was
about
to
happen
he
turned
to
kozlovski
with
urgent
questions
immediately
prince
said
kozlovski
dispositions
for
bagration
what
about
capitulation
nothing
of
the
sort
orders
are
issued
for
a
battle
prince
andrew
moved
toward
the
door
from
whence
voices
were
heard
just
as
he
was
going
to
open
it
the
sounds
ceased
the
door
opened
and
kutuzov
with
his
eagle
nose
and
puffy
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
prince
andrew
stood
right
in
front
of
kutuzov
but
the
expression
of
the
commander
in
chief
s
one
sound
eye
showed
him
to
be
so
preoccupied
with
thoughts
and
anxieties
as
to
be
oblivious
of
his
presence
he
looked
straight
at
his
adjutant
s
face
without
recognizing
him
well
have
you
finished
said
he
to
kozlovski
one
moment
your
excellency
bagration
a
gaunt
middle
aged
man
of
medium
height
with
a
firm
impassive
face
of
oriental
type
came
out
after
the
commander
in
chief
i
have
the
honor
to
present
myself
repeated
prince
andrew
rather
loudly
handing
kutuzov
an
envelope
ah
from
vienna
very
good
later
later
kutuzov
went
out
into
the
porch
with
bagration
well
good
by
prince
said
he
to
bagration
my
blessing
and
may
christ
be
with
you
in
your
great
endeavor
his
face
suddenly
softened
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
with
his
left
hand
he
drew
bagration
toward
him
and
with
his
right
on
which
he
wore
a
ring
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
with
a
gesture
evidently
habitual
offering
his
puffy
cheek
but
bagration
kissed
him
on
the
neck
instead
christ
be
with
you
kutuzov
repeated
and
went
toward
his
carriage
get
in
with
me
said
he
to
bolkonski
your
excellency
i
should
like
to
be
of
use
here
allow
me
to
remain
with
prince
bagration
s
detachment
get
in
said
kutuzov
and
noticing
that
bolkonski
still
delayed
he
added
i
need
good
officers
myself
need
them
myself
they
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
there
is
still
much
much
before
us
he
said
as
if
with
an
old
man
s
penetration
he
understood
all
that
was
passing
in
bolkonski
s
mind
if
a
tenth
part
of
his
detachment
returns
i
shall
thank
god
he
added
as
if
speaking
to
himself
prince
andrew
glanced
at
kutuzov
s
face
only
a
foot
distant
from
him
and
involuntarily
noticed
the
carefully
washed
seams
of
the
scar
near
his
temple
where
an
ismail
bullet
had
pierced
his
skull
and
the
empty
eye
socket
yes
he
has
a
right
to
speak
so
calmly
of
those
men
s
death
thought
bolkonski
that
is
why
i
beg
to
be
sent
to
that
detachment
he
said
kutuzov
did
not
reply
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
what
he
had
been
saying
and
sat
plunged
in
thought
five
minutes
later
gently
swaying
on
the
soft
springs
of
the
carriage
he
turned
to
prince
andrew
there
was
not
a
trace
of
agitation
on
his
face
with
delicate
irony
he
questioned
prince
andrew
about
the
details
of
his
interview
with
the
emperor
about
the
remarks
he
had
heard
at
court
concerning
the
krems
affair
and
about
some
ladies
they
both
knew
chapter
xiv
on
november
kutuzov
had
received
through
a
spy
news
that
the
army
he
commanded
was
in
an
almost
hopeless
position
the
spy
reported
that
the
french
after
crossing
the
bridge
at
vienna
were
advancing
in
immense
force
upon
kutuzov
s
line
of
communication
with
the
troops
that
were
arriving
from
russia
if
kutuzov
decided
to
remain
at
krems
napoleon
s
army
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
would
cut
him
off
completely
and
surround
his
exhausted
army
of
forty
thousand
and
he
would
find
himself
in
the
position
of
mack
at
ulm
if
kutuzov
decided
to
abandon
the
road
connecting
him
with
the
troops
arriving
from
russia
he
would
have
to
march
with
no
road
into
unknown
parts
of
the
bohemian
mountains
defending
himself
against
superior
forces
of
the
enemy
and
abandoning
all
hope
of
a
junction
with
buxhowden
if
kutuzov
decided
to
retreat
along
the
road
from
krems
to
olmutz
to
unite
with
the
troops
arriving
from
russia
he
risked
being
forestalled
on
that
road
by
the
french
who
had
crossed
the
vienna
bridge
and
encumbered
by
his
baggage
and
transport
having
to
accept
battle
on
the
march
against
an
enemy
three
times
as
strong
who
would
hem
him
in
from
two
sides
kutuzov
chose
this
latter
course
the
french
the
spy
reported
having
crossed
the
vienna
bridge
were
advancing
by
forced
marches
toward
znaim
which
lay
sixty
six
miles
off
on
the
line
of
kutuzov
s
retreat
if
he
reached
znaim
before
the
french
there
would
be
great
hope
of
saving
the
army
to
let
the
french
forestall
him
at
znaim
meant
the
exposure
of
his
whole
army
to
a
disgrace
such
as
that
of
ulm
or
to
utter
destruction
but
to
forestall
the
french
with
his
whole
army
was
impossible
the
road
for
the
french
from
vienna
to
znaim
was
shorter
and
better
than
the
road
for
the
russians
from
krems
to
znaim
the
night
he
received
the
news
kutuzov
sent
bagration
s
vanguard
four
thousand
strong
to
the
right
across
the
hills
from
the
krems
znaim
to
the
vienna
znaim
road
bagration
was
to
make
this
march
without
resting
and
to
halt
facing
vienna
with
znaim
to
his
rear
and
if
he
succeeded
in
forestalling
the
french
he
was
to
delay
them
as
long
as
possible
kutuzov
himself
with
all
his
transport
took
the
road
to
znaim
marching
thirty
miles
that
stormy
night
across
roadless
hills
with
his
hungry
ill
shod
soldiers
and
losing
a
third
of
his
men
as
stragglers
by
the
way
bagration
came
out
on
the
vienna
znaim
road
at
hollabrunn
a
few
hours
ahead
of
the
french
who
were
approaching
hollabrunn
from
vienna
kutuzov
with
his
transport
had
still
to
march
for
some
days
before
he
could
reach
znaim
hence
bagration
with
his
four
thousand
hungry
exhausted
men
would
have
to
detain
for
days
the
whole
enemy
army
that
came
upon
him
at
hollabrunn
which
was
clearly
impossible
but
a
freak
of
fate
made
the
impossible
possible
the
success
of
the
trick
that
had
placed
the
vienna
bridge
in
the
hands
of
the
french
without
a
fight
led
murat
to
try
to
deceive
kutuzov
in
a
similar
way
meeting
bagration
s
weak
detachment
on
the
znaim
road
he
supposed
it
to
be
kutuzov
s
whole
army
to
be
able
to
crush
it
absolutely
he
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
rest
of
the
troops
who
were
on
their
way
from
vienna
and
with
this
object
offered
a
three
days
truce
on
condition
that
both
armies
should
remain
in
position
without
moving
murat
declared
that
negotiations
for
peace
were
already
proceeding
and
that
he
therefore
offered
this
truce
to
avoid
unnecessary
bloodshed
count
nostitz
the
austrian
general
occupying
the
advanced
posts
believed
murat
s
emissary
and
retired
leaving
bagration
s
division
exposed
another
emissary
rode
to
the
russian
line
to
announce
the
peace
negotiations
and
to
offer
the
russian
army
the
three
days
truce
bagration
replied
that
he
was
not
authorized
either
to
accept
or
refuse
a
truce
and
sent
his
adjutant
to
kutuzov
to
report
the
offer
he
had
received
a
truce
was
kutuzov
s
sole
chance
of
gaining
time
giving
bagration
s
exhausted
troops
some
rest
and
letting
the
transport
and
heavy
convoys
whose
movements
were
concealed
from
the
french
advance
if
but
one
stage
nearer
znaim
the
offer
of
a
truce
gave
the
only
and
a
quite
unexpected
chance
of
saving
the
army
on
receiving
the
news
he
immediately
dispatched
adjutant
general
wintzingerode
who
was
in
attendance
on
him
to
the
enemy
camp
wintzingerode
was
not
merely
to
agree
to
the
truce
but
also
to
offer
terms
of
capitulation
and
meanwhile
kutuzov
sent
his
adjutants
back
to
hasten
to
the
utmost
the
movements
of
the
baggage
trains
of
the
entire
army
along
the
krems
znaim
road
bagration
s
exhausted
and
hungry
detachment
which
alone
covered
this
movement
of
the
transport
and
of
the
whole
army
had
to
remain
stationary
in
face
of
an
enemy
eight
times
as
strong
as
itself
kutuzov
s
expectations
that
the
proposals
of
capitulation
which
were
in
no
way
binding
might
give
time
for
part
of
the
transport
to
pass
and
also
that
murat
s
mistake
would
very
soon
be
discovered
proved
correct
as
soon
as
bonaparte
who
was
at
schonbrunn
sixteen
miles
from
hollabrunn
received
murat
s
dispatch
with
the
proposal
of
a
truce
and
a
capitulation
he
detected
a
ruse
and
wrote
the
following
letter
to
murat
schonbrunn
th
brumaire
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
prince
murat
i
cannot

to
you
my
displeasure
you
command
only
my
advance
guard
and
have
no
right
to
arrange
an
armistice
without
my
order
you
are
causing
me
to
lose
the
fruits
of
a
campaign
break
the
armistice
immediately
and
march
on
the
enemy
inform
him
that
the
general
who
signed
that
capitulation
had
no
right
to
do
so
and
that
no
one
but
the
emperor
of
russia
has
that
right
if
however
the
emperor
of
russia
ratifies
that
convention
i
will
ratify
it
but
it
is
only
a
trick

chapter
xv
between
three
and
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
prince
andrew
who
had
persisted
in
his
request
to
kutuzov
arrived
at
grunth
and
reported
himself
to
bagration
bonaparte
s
adjutant
had
not
yet
reached
murat

and
the
battle
had
not

begun

no

knew
anything
of
the
general
position
of
affairs
they
talked
of
peace
but
did
not
believe
in
its
possibility
others
talked
of
a
battle
but
also
disbelieved
in
the
nearness
of
an
engagement
bagration
knowing
bolkonski
to
be
a
favorite
and
trusted
adjutant
received
him
with
distinction
and
special
marks
of
favor
explaining
to
him
that
there
would
probably
be
an
engagement
that
day
or
the
next
and
giving
him
full
liberty
to
remain
with
him
during
the
battle
or
to
join
the
rearguard
and
have
an
eye
on
the
order
of
retreat
which
is
also
very
important
however
there
will
hardly
be
an
engagement
today
said
bagration
as
if
to
reassure
prince
andrew
if
he
is
one
of
the
ordinary
little
staff
dandies
sent
to
earn
a
medal
he
can
get
his
reward
just
as
well
in
the
rearguard
but
if
he
wishes
to
stay
with
me
let
him
he
ll
be
of
use
here
if
he
s
a
brave
officer
thought
bagration
prince
andrew
without
replying
asked
the
prince
s
permission
to
ride
round
the
position
to
see
the
disposition
of
the
forces
so
as
to
know
his
bearings
should
he
be
sent
to
execute
an
order
the
officer
on
duty
a
handsome
elegantly
dressed
man
with
a
diamond
ring
on
his
forefinger
who
was
fond
of
speaking
french
though
he
spoke
it
badly
offered
to
conduct
prince
andrew
on
all
sides
they
saw
rain
soaked
officers
with
dejected
faces
who
seemed
to
be
seeking
something
and
soldiers
dragging
doors
benches
and
fencing
from
the
village
there
now
prince
we
can
t
stop
those
fellows
said
the
staff
officer
pointing
to
the
soldiers
the
officers
don
t
keep
them
in
hand
and
there
he
pointed
to
a
sutler
s
tent
they
crowd
in
and
sit
this
morning
i
turned
them
all
out
and
now
look
it
s
full
again
i
must
go
there
prince
and
scare
them
a
bit
it
won
t
take
a
moment
yes
let
s
go
in
and
i
will
get
myself
a
roll
and
some
cheese
said
prince
andrew
who
had
not
yet
had
time
to
eat
anything
why
didn
t
you
mention
it
prince
i
would
have
offered
you
something
they
dismounted
and
entered
the
tent
several
officers
with
flushed
and
weary
faces
were
sitting
at
the
table
eating
and
drinking
now
what
does
this
mean
gentlemen
said
the
staff
officer
in
the
reproachful
tone
of
a
man
who
has
repeated
the
same
thing
more
than
once
you
know
it
won
t
do
to
leave
your
posts
like
this
the
prince
gave
orders
that
no
one
should
leave
his
post
now
you
captain
and
he
turned
to
a
thin
dirty
little
artillery
officer
who
without
his
boots
he
had
given
them
to
the
canteen
keeper
to
dry
in
only
his
stockings
rose
when
they
entered
smiling
not
altogether
comfortably
well
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
captain
tushin
he
continued
one
would
think
that
as
an
artillery
officer
you
would
set
a
good
example
yet
here
you
are
without
your
boots
the
alarm
will
be
sounded
and
you
ll
be
in
a
pretty
position
without
your
boots
the
staff
officer
smiled
kindly
return
to
your
posts
gentlemen
all
of
you
all
he
added
in
a
tone
of
command
prince
andrew
smiled
involuntarily
as
he
looked
at
the
artillery
officer
tushin
who
silent
and
smiling
shifting
from
one
stockinged
foot
to
the
other
glanced
inquiringly
with
his
large
intelligent
kindly
eyes
from
prince
andrew
to
the
staff
officer
the
soldiers
say
it
feels
easier
without
boots
said
captain
tushin
smiling
shyly
in
his
uncomfortable
position
evidently
wishing
to
adopt
a
jocular
tone
but
before
he
had
finished
he
felt
that
his
jest
was
unacceptable
and
had
not
come
off
he
grew
confused
kindly
return
to
your
posts
said
the
staff
officer
trying
to
preserve
his
gravity
prince
andrew
glanced
again
at
the
artillery
officer
s
small
figure
there
was
something
peculiar
about
it
quite
unsoldierly
rather
comic
but
extremely
attractive
the
staff
officer
and
prince
andrew
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
on
having
ridden
beyond
the
village
continually
meeting
and
overtaking
soldiers
and
officers
of
various
regiments
they
saw
on
their
left
some
entrenchments
being
thrown
up
the
freshly
dug
clay
of
which
showed
up
red
several
battalions
of
soldiers
in
their
shirt
sleeves
despite
the
cold
wind
swarmed
in
these
earthworks
like
a
host
of
white
ants
spadefuls
of
red
clay
were
continually
being
thrown
up
from
behind
the
bank
by
unseen
hands
prince
andrew
and
the
officer
rode
up
looked
at
the
entrenchment
and
went
on
again
just
behind
it
they
came
upon
some
dozens
of
soldiers
continually
replaced
by
others
who
ran
from
the
entrenchment
they
had
to
hold
their
noses
and
put
their
horses
to
a
trot
to
escape
from
the
poisoned
atmosphere
of
these
latrines
voila
l
agrement

camps
monsieur
le
prince
said
the
staff
officer
this
is
a
pleasure
one
gets
in
camp
prince
they
rode
up
the
opposite
hill
from
there
the
french
could
already
be
seen
prince
andrew
stopped
and
began
examining
the
position
that
s
our
battery
said
the
staff
officer
indicating
the
highest
point
it
s
in
charge
of
the
queer
fellow
we
saw
without
his
boots
you
can
see
everything
from
there
let
s
go
there
prince
thank
you
very
much
i
will
go
on
alone
said
prince
andrew
wishing
to
rid
himself
of
this
staff
officer
s
company
please
don
t
trouble
yourself
further
the
staff
officer
remained
behind
and
prince
andrew
rode
on
alone
the
farther
forward
and
nearer
the
enemy
he
went
the
more
orderly
and
cheerful
were
the
troops
the
greatest
disorder
and
depression
had
been
in
the
baggage
train
he
had
passed
that
morning
on
the
znaim
road
seven
miles
away
from
the
french
at
grunth
also
some
apprehension
and
alarm
could
be
felt
but
the
nearer
prince
andrew
came
to
the
french
lines
the
more
confident
was
the
appearance
of
our
troops
the
soldiers
in
their
greatcoats
were
ranged
in
lines
the
sergeants
major
and
company
officers
were
counting
the
men
poking
the
last
man
in
each
section
in
the
ribs
and
telling
him
to
hold
his
hand
up
soldiers
scattered
over
the
whole
place
were
dragging
logs
and
brushwood
and
were
building
shelters
with
merry
chatter
and
laughter
around
the
fires
sat
others
dressed
and
undressed
drying
their
shirts
and
leg
bands
or
mending
boots
or
overcoats
and
crowding
round
the
boilers
and
porridge
cookers
in
one
company
dinner
was
ready
and
the
soldiers
were
gazing
eagerly
at
the
steaming
boiler
waiting
till
the
sample
which
a
quartermaster
sergeant
was
carrying
in
a
wooden
bowl
to
an
officer
who
sat
on
a
log
before
his
shelter
had
been
tasted
another
company
a
lucky
one
for
not
all
the
companies
had
vodka
crowded
round
a
pockmarked
broad
shouldered
sergeant
major
who
tilting
a
keg
filled
one
after
another
the
canteen
lids
held
out
to
him
the
soldiers
lifted
the
canteen
lids
to
their
lips
with
reverential
faces
emptied
them
rolling
the
vodka
in
their
mouths
and
walked
away
from
the
sergeant
major
with
brightened
expressions
licking
their
lips
and
wiping
them
on
the
sleeves
of
their
greatcoats
all
their
faces
were
as
serene
as
if
all
this
were
happening
at
home
awaiting
peaceful
encampment
and
not
within
sight
of
the
enemy
before
an
action
in
which
at
least
half
of
them
would
be
left
on
the
field
after
passing
a
chasseur
regiment
and
in
the
lines
of
the
kiev
grenadiers
fine
fellows
busy
with
similar
peaceful
affairs
near
the
shelter
of
the
regimental
commander
higher
than
and
different
from
the
others
prince
andrew
came
out
in
front
of
a
platoon
of
grenadiers
before
whom
lay
a
naked
man
two
soldiers
held
him
while
two
others
were
flourishing
their
switches
and
striking
him
regularly
on
his
bare
back
the
man
shrieked
unnaturally
a
stout
major
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
line
and
regardless
of
the
screams
kept
repeating
it
s
a
shame
for
a
soldier
to
steal
a
soldier
must
be
honest
honorable
and
brave
but
if
he
robs
his
fellows
there
is
no
honor
in
him
he
s
a
scoundrel
go
on
go
on
so
the
swishing
sound
of
the
strokes
and
the
desperate
but
unnatural
screams
continued
go
on
go
on
said
the
major
a
young
officer
with
a
bewildered
and
pained
expression
on
his
face
stepped
away
from
the
man
and
looked
round
inquiringly
at
the
adjutant
as
he
rode
by
prince
andrew
having
reached
the
front
line
rode
along
it
our
front
line
and
that
of
the
enemy
were
far
apart
on
the
right
and
left
flanks
but
in
the
center
where
the
men
with
a
flag
of
truce
had
passed
that
morning
the
lines
were
so
near
together
that
the
men
could
see
one
another
s
faces
and
speak
to
one
another
besides
the
soldiers
who
formed
the
picket
line
on
either
side
there
were
many
curious
onlookers
who
jesting
and
laughing
stared
at
their
strange
foreign
enemies
since
early
morning
despite
an
injunction
not
to
approach
the
picket
line
the
officers
had
been
unable
to
keep
sight
seers
away
the
soldiers
forming
the
picket
line
like
showmen
exhibiting
a
curiosity
no
longer
looked
at
the
french
but
paid
attention
to
the
sight
seers
and
grew
weary
waiting
to
be
relieved
prince
andrew
halted
to
have
a
look
at
the
french
look
look
there
one
soldier
was
saying
to
another
pointing
to
a
russian
musketeer
who
had
gone
up
to
the
picket
line
with
an
officer
and
was
rapidly
and
excitedly
talking
to
a
french
grenadier
hark
to
him
jabbering
fine
isn
t
it
it
s
all
the
frenchy
can
do
to
keep
up
with
him
there
now
sidorov
wait
a
bit
and
listen
it
s
fine
answered
sidorov
who
was
considered
an
adept
at
french
the
soldier
to
whom
the
laughers
referred
was
dolokhov
prince
andrew
recognized
him
and
stopped
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
dolokhov
had
come
from
the
left
flank
where
their
regiment
was
stationed
with
his
captain
now
then
go
on
go
on
incited
the
officer
bending
forward
and
trying
not
to
lose
a
word
of
the
speech
which
was
incomprehensible
to
him
more
please
more
what
s
he
saying
dolokhov
did
not
answer
the
captain
he
had
been
drawn
into
a
hot
dispute
with
the
french
grenadier
they
were
naturally
talking
about
the
campaign
the
frenchman
confusing
the
austrians
with
the
russians
was
trying
to
prove
that
the
russians
had
surrendered
and
had
fled
all
the
way
from
ulm
while
dolokhov
maintained
that
the
russians
had
not
surrendered
but
had
beaten
the
french
we
have
orders
to
drive
you
off
here
and
we
shall
drive
you
off
said
dolokhov
only
take
care
you
and
your
cossacks
are
not
all
captured
said
the
french
grenadier
the
french
onlookers
and
listeners
laughed
we
ll
make
you
dance
as
we
did
under
suvorov
said
dolokhov
on
vous
fera
danser
qu
est
ce
qu
il
chante
asked
a
frenchman
what
s
he
singing
about
it
s
ancient
history
said
another
guessing
that
it
referred
to
a
former
war
the
emperor
will
teach
your
suvara
as
he
has
taught
the
others
bonaparte
began
dolokhov
but
the
frenchman
interrupted
him
not
bonaparte
he
is
the
emperor
sacre
nom
cried
he
angrily
the
devil
skin
your
emperor
and
dolokhov
swore
at
him
in
coarse
soldier
s
russian
and
shouldering
his
musket
walked
away
let
us
go
ivan
lukich
he
said
to
the
captain
ah
that
s
the
way
to
talk
french
said
the
picket
soldiers
now
sidorov
you
have
a
try
sidorov
turning
to
the
french
winked
and
began
to
jabber
meaningless
sounds
very
fast
kari
mala
tafa
safi
muter
kaska
he
said
trying
to
give
an
expressive
intonation
to
his
voice
ho
ho
ho
ha
ha
ha
ha
ouh
ouh
came
peals
of
such
healthy
and
good
humored
laughter
from
the
soldiers
that
it
infected
the
french
involuntarily
so
much
so
that
the
only
thing
left
to
do
seemed
to
be
to
unload
the
muskets
explode
the
ammunition
and
all
return
home
as
quickly
as
possible
but
the
guns
remained
loaded
the
loopholes
in
blockhouses
and
entrenchments
looked
out
just
as
menacingly
and
the
unlimbered
cannon
confronted
one
another
as
before
chapter
xvi
having
ridden
round
the
whole
line
from
right
flank
to
left
prince
andrew
made
his
way
up
to
the
battery
from
which
the
staff
officer
had
told
him
the
whole
field
could
be
seen
here
he
dismounted
and
stopped
beside
the
farthest
of
the
four
unlimbered
cannon
before
the
guns
an
artillery
sentry
was
pacing
up
and
down
he
stood
at
attention
when
the
officer
arrived
but
at
a
sign
resumed
his
measured
monotonous
pacing
behind
the
guns
were
their
limbers
and
still
farther
back
picket
ropes
and
artillerymen
s
bonfires
to
the
left
not
far
from
the
farthest
cannon
was
a
small
newly
constructed
wattle
shed
from
which
came
the
sound
of
officers
voices
in
eager
conversation
it
was
true
that
a
view
over
nearly
the
whole
russian
position
and
the
greater
part
of
the
enemy
s
opened
out
from
this
battery
just
facing
it
on
the
crest
of
the
opposite
hill
the
village
of
schon
grabern
could
be
seen
and
in
three
places
to
left
and
right
the
french
troops
amid
the
smoke
of
their
campfires
the
greater
part
of
whom
were
evidently
in
the
village
itself
and
behind
the
hill
to
the
left
from
that
village
amid
the
smoke
was
something
resembling
a
battery
but
it
was
impossible
to
see
it
clearly
with
the
naked
eye
our
right
flank
was
posted
on
a
rather
steep
incline
which
dominated
the
french
position
our
infantry
were
stationed
there
and
at
the
farthest
point
the
dragoons
in
the
center
where
tushin
s
battery
stood
and
from
which
prince
andrew
was
surveying
the
position
was
the
easiest
and
most
direct
descent
and
ascent
to
the
brook
separating
us
from
schon
grabern
on
the
left
our
troops
were
close
to
a
copse
in
which
smoked
the
bonfires
of
our
infantry
who
were
felling
wood
the
french
line
was
wider
than
ours
and
it
was
plain
that
they
could
easily
outflank
us
on
both
sides
behind
our
position
was
a
steep
and
deep
dip
making
it
difficult
for
artillery
and
cavalry
to
retire
prince
andrew
took
out
his
notebook
and
leaning
on
the
cannon
sketched
a
plan
of
the
position
he
made
some
notes
on
two
points
intending
to
mention
them
to
bagration
his
idea
was
first
to
concentrate
all
the
artillery
in
the
center
and
secondly
to
withdraw
the
cavalry
to
the
other
side
of
the
dip
prince
andrew
being
always
near
the
commander
in
chief
closely
following
the
mass
movements
and
general
orders
and
constantly
studying
historical
accounts
of
battles
involuntarily
pictured
to
himself
the
course
of
events
in
the
forthcoming
action
in
broad
outline
he
imagined
only
important
possibilities
if
the
enemy
attacks
the
right
flank
he
said
to
himself
the
kiev
grenadiers
and
the
podolsk
chasseurs
must
hold
their
position
till
reserves
from
the
center
come
up
in
that
case
the
dragoons
could
successfully
make
a
flank
counterattack
if
they
attack
our
center
we
having
the
center
battery
on
this
high
ground
shall
withdraw
the
left
flank
under
its
cover
and
retreat
to
the
dip
by
echelons
so
he
reasoned
all
the
time
he
had
been
beside
the
gun
he
had
heard
the
voices
of
the
officers
distinctly
but
as
often
happens
had
not
understood
a
word
of
what
they
were
saying
suddenly
however
he
was
struck
by
a
voice
coming
from
the
shed
and
its
tone
was
so
sincere
that
he
could
not
but
listen
no
friend
said
a
pleasant
and
as
it
seemed
to
prince
andrew
a
familiar
voice
what
i
say
is
that
if
it
were
possible
to
know
what
is
beyond
death
none
of
us
would
be
afraid
of
it
that
s
so
friend
another
a
younger
voice
interrupted
him
afraid
or
not
you
can
t
escape
it
anyhow
all
the
same
one
is
afraid
oh
you
clever
people
said
a
third
manly
voice
interrupting
them
both
of
course
you
artillery
men
are
very
wise
because
you
can
take
everything
along
with
you
vodka
and
snacks
and
the
owner
of
the
manly
voice
evidently
an
infantry
officer
laughed
yes
one
is
afraid
continued
the
first
speaker
he
of
the
familiar
voice
one
is
afraid
of
the
unknown
that
s
what
it
is
whatever
we
may
say
about
the
soul
going
to
the
sky
we
know
there
is
no
sky
but
only
an
atmosphere
the
manly
voice
again
interrupted
the
artillery
officer
well
stand
us
some
of
your
herb
vodka
tushin
it
said
why
thought
prince
andrew
that
s
the
captain
who
stood
up
in
the
sutler
s
hut
without
his
boots
he
recognized
the
agreeable
philosophizing
voice
with
pleasure
some
herb
vodka
certainly
said
tushin
but
still
to
conceive
a
future
life
he
did
not
finish
just
then
there
was
a
whistle
in
the
air
nearer
and
nearer
faster
and
louder
louder
and
faster
a
cannon
ball
as
if
it
had
not
finished
saying
what
was
necessary
thudded
into
the
ground
near
the
shed
with
super
human
force
throwing
up
a
mass
of
earth
the
ground
seemed
to
groan
at
the
terrible
impact
and
immediately
tushin
with
a
short
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
his
kind
intelligent
face
rather
pale
rushed
out
of
the
shed
followed
by
the
owner
of
the
manly
voice
a
dashing
infantry
officer
who
hurried
off
to
his
company
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
he
ran
chapter
xvii
mounting
his
horse
again
prince
andrew
lingered
with
the
battery
looking
at
the
puff
from
the
gun
that
had
sent
the
ball
his
eyes
ran
rapidly
over
the
wide
space
but
he
only
saw
that
the
hitherto
motionless
masses
of
the
french
now
swayed
and
that
there
really
was
a
battery
to
their
left
the
smoke
above
it
had
not
yet
dispersed
two
mounted
frenchmen
probably
adjutants
were
galloping
up
the
hill
a
small
but
distinctly
visible
enemy
column
was
moving
down
the
hill
probably
to
strengthen
the
front
line
the
smoke
of
the
first
shot
had
not
yet
dispersed
before
another
puff
appeared
followed
by
a
report
the
battle
had
begun
prince
andrew
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
to
grunth
to
find
prince
bagration
he
heard
the
cannonade
behind
him
growing
louder
and
more
frequent
evidently
our
guns
had
begun
to
reply
from
the
bottom
of
the
slope
where
the
parleys
had
taken
place
came
the
report
of
musketry
lemarrois
had
just
arrived
at
a
gallop
with
bonaparte
s
stern
letter
and
murat
humiliated
and
anxious
to
expiate
his
fault
had
at
once
moved
his
forces
to
attack
the
center
and
outflank
both
the
russian
wings
hoping
before
evening
and
before
the
arrival
of
the
emperor
to
crush
the
contemptible
detachment
that
stood
before
him
it
has
begun
here
it
is
thought
prince
andrew
feeling
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
but
where
and
how
will
my
toulon
present
itself
passing
between
the
companies
that
had
been
eating
porridge
and
drinking
vodka
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
saw
everywhere
the
same
rapid
movement
of
soldiers
forming
ranks
and
getting
their
muskets
ready
and
on
all
their
faces
he
recognized
the
same
eagerness
that
filled
his
heart
it
has
begun
here
it
is
dreadful
but
enjoyable
was
what
the
face
of
each
soldier
and
each
officer
seemed
to
say
before
he
had
reached
the
embankments
that
were
being
thrown
up
he
saw
in
the
light
of
the
dull
autumn
evening
mounted
men
coming
toward
him
the
foremost
wearing
a
cossack
cloak
and
lambskin
cap
and
riding
a
white
horse
was
prince
bagration
prince
andrew
stopped
waiting
for
him
to
come
up
prince
bagration
reined
in
his
horse
and
recognizing
prince
andrew
nodded
to
him
he
still
looked
ahead
while
prince
andrew
told
him
what
he
had
seen
the
feeling
it
has
begun
here
it
is
was
seen
even
on
prince
bagration
s
hard
brown
face
with
its
half
closed
dull
sleepy
eyes
prince
andrew
gazed
with
anxious
curiosity
at
that
impassive
face
and
wished
he
could
tell
what
if
anything
this
man
was
thinking
and
feeling
at
that
moment
is
there
anything
at
all
behind
that
impassive
face
prince
andrew
asked
himself
as
he
looked
prince
bagration
bent
his
head
in
sign
of
agreement
with
what
prince
andrew
told
him
and
said
very
good
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
imply
that
everything
that
took
place
and
was
reported
to
him
was
exactly
what
he
had
foreseen
prince
andrew
out
of
breath
with
his
rapid
ride
spoke
quickly
prince
bagration
uttering
his
words
with
an
oriental
accent
spoke
particularly
slowly
as
if
to
impress
the
fact
that
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
however
he
put
his
horse
to
a
trot
in
the
direction
of
tushin
s
battery
prince
andrew
followed
with
the
suite
behind
prince
bagration
rode
an
officer
of
the
suite
the
prince
s
personal
adjutant
zherkov
an
orderly
officer
the
staff
officer
on
duty
riding
a
fine
bobtailed
horse
and
a
civilian
an
accountant
who
had
asked
permission
to
be
present
at
the
battle
out
of
curiosity
the
accountant
a
stout
full
faced
man
looked
around
him
with
a
naive
smile
of
satisfaction
and
presented
a
strange
appearance
among
the
hussars
cossacks
and
adjutants
in
his
camlet
coat
as
he
jolted
on
his
horse
with
a
convoy
officer
s
saddle
he
wants
to
see
a
battle
said
zherkov
to
bolkonski
pointing
to
the
accountant
but
he
feels
a
pain
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
already
oh
leave
off
said
the
accountant
with
a
beaming
but
rather
cunning
smile
as
if
flattered
at
being
made
the
subject
of
zherkov
s
joke
and
purposely
trying
to
appear
stupider
than
he
really
was
it
is
very
strange
mon
monsieur
prince
said
the
staff
officer
he
remembered
that
in
french
there
is
some
peculiar
way
of
addressing
a
prince
but
could
not
get
it
quite
right
by
this
time
they
were
all
approaching
tushin
s
battery
and
a
ball
struck
the
ground
in
front
of
them
what
s
that
that
has
fallen
asked
the
accountant
with
a
naive
smile
a
french
pancake
answered
zherkov
so
that
s
what
they
hit
with
asked
the
accountant
how
awful
he
seemed
to
swell
with
satisfaction
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
they
again
heard
an
unexpectedly
violent
whistling
which
suddenly
ended
with
a
thud
into
something
soft
f
f
flop
and
a
cossack
riding
a
little
to
their
right
and
behind
the
accountant
crashed
to
earth
with
his
horse
zherkov
and
the
staff
officer
bent
over
their
saddles
and
turned
their
horses
away
the
accountant
stopped
facing
the
cossack
and
examined
him
with
attentive
curiosity
the
cossack
was
dead
but
the
horse
still
struggled
prince
bagration
screwed
up
his
eyes
looked
round
and
seeing
the
cause
of
the
confusion
turned
away
with
indifference
as
if
to
say
is
it
worth
while
noticing
trifles
he
reined
in
his
horse
with
the
care
of
a
skillful
rider
and
slightly
bending
over
disengaged
his
saber
which
had
caught
in
his
cloak
it
was
an
old
fashioned
saber
of
a
kind
no
longer
in
general
use
prince
andrew
remembered
the
story
of
suvorov
giving
his
saber
to
bagration
in
italy
and
the
recollection
was
particularly
pleasant
at
that
moment
they
had
reached
the
battery
at
which
prince
andrew
had
been
when
he
examined
the
battlefield
whose
company
asked
prince
bagration
of
an
artilleryman
standing
by
the
ammunition
wagon
he
asked
whose
company
but
he
really
meant
are
you
frightened
here
and
the
artilleryman
understood
him
captain
tushin
s
your
excellency
shouted
the
red
haired
freckled
gunner
in
a
merry
voice
standing
to
attention
yes
yes
muttered
bagration
as
if
considering
something
and
he
rode
past
the
limbers
to
the
farthest
cannon
as
he
approached
a
ringing
shot
issued
from
it
deafening
him
and
his
suite
and
in
the
smoke
that
suddenly
surrounded
the
gun
they
could
see
the
gunners
who
had
seized
it
straining
to
roll
it
quickly
back
to
its
former
position
a
huge
broad
shouldered
gunner
number
one
holding
a
mop
his
legs
far
apart
sprang
to
the
wheel
while
number
two
with
a
trembling
hand
placed
a
charge
in
the
cannon
s
mouth
the
short
round
shouldered
captain
tushin
stumbling
over
the
tail
of
the
gun
carriage
moved
forward
and
not
noticing
the
general
looked
out
shading
his
eyes
with
his
small
hand
lift
it
two
lines
more
and
it
will
be
just
right
cried
he
in
a
feeble
voice
to
which
he
tried
to
impart
a
dashing
note
ill
suited
to
his
weak
figure
number
two
he
squeaked
fire
medvedev
bagration
called
to
him
and
tushin
raising
three
fingers
to
his
cap
with
a
bashful
and
awkward
gesture
not
at
all
like
a
military
salute
but
like
a
priest
s
benediction
approached
the
general
though
tushin
s
guns
had
been
intended
to
cannonade
the
valley
he
was
firing
incendiary
balls
at
the
village
of
schon
grabern
visible
just
opposite
in
front
of
which
large
masses
of
french
were
advancing
no
one
had
given
tushin
orders
where
and
at
what
to
fire
but
after
consulting
his
sergeant
major
zakharchenko
for
whom
he
had
great
respect
he
had
decided
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
set
fire
to
the
village
very
good
said
bagration
in
reply
to
the
officer
s
report
and
began
deliberately
to
examine
the
whole
battlefield
extended
before
him
the
french
had
advanced
nearest
on
our
right
below
the
height
on
which
the
kiev
regiment
was
stationed
in
the
hollow
where
the
rivulet
flowed
the
soul
stirring
rolling
and
crackling
of
musketry
was
heard
and
much
farther
to
the
right
beyond
the
dragoons
the
officer
of
the
suite
pointed
out
to
bagration
a
french
column
that
was
outflanking
us
to
the
left
the
horizon
bounded
by
the
adjacent
wood
prince
bagration
ordered
two
battalions
from
the
center
to
be
sent
to
reinforce
the
right
flank
the
officer
of
the
suite
ventured
to
remark
to
the
prince
that
if
these
battalions
went
away
the
guns
would
remain
without
support
prince
bagration
turned
to
the
officer
and
with
his
dull
eyes
looked
at
him
in
silence
it
seemed
to
prince
andrew
that
the
officer
s
remark
was
just
and
that
really
no
answer
could
be
made
to
it
but
at
that
moment
an
adjutant
galloped
up
with
a
message
from
the
commander
of
the
regiment
in
the
hollow
and
news
that
immense
masses
of
the
french
were
coming
down
upon
them
and
that
his
regiment
was
in
disorder
and
was
retreating
upon
the
kiev
grenadiers
prince
bagration
bowed
his
head
in
sign
of
assent
and
approval
he
rode
off
at
a
walk
to
the
right
and
sent
an
adjutant
to
the
dragoons
with
orders
to
attack
the
french
but
this
adjutant
returned
half
an
hour
later
with
the
news
that
the
commander
of
the
dragoons
had
already
retreated
beyond
the
dip
in
the
ground
as
a
heavy
fire
had
been
opened
on
him
and
he
was
losing
men
uselessly
and
so
had
hastened
to
throw
some
sharpshooters
into
the
wood
very
good
said
bagration
as
he
was
leaving
the
battery
firing
was
heard
on
the
left
also
and
as
it
was
too
far
to
the
left
flank
for
him
to
have
time
to
go
there
himself
prince
bagration
sent
zherkov
to
tell
the
general
in
command
the
one
who
had
paraded
his
regiment
before
kutuzov
at
braunau
that
he
must
retreat
as
quickly
as
possible
behind
the
hollow
in
the
rear
as
the
right
flank
would
probably
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
enemy
s
attack
very
long
about
tushin
and
the
battalion
that
had
been
in
support
of
his
battery
all
was
forgotten
prince
andrew
listened
attentively
to
bagration
s
colloquies
with
the
commanding
officers
and
the
orders
he
gave
them
and
to
his
surprise
found
that
no
orders
were
really
given
but
that
prince
bagration
tried
to
make
it
appear
that
everything
done
by
necessity
by
accident
or
by
the
will
of
subordinate
commanders
was
done
if
not
by
his
direct
command
at
least
in
accord
with
his
intentions
prince
andrew
noticed
however
that
though
what
happened
was
due
to
chance
and
was
independent
of
the
commander
s
will
owing
to
the
tact
bagration
showed
his
presence
was
very
valuable
officers
who
approached
him
with
disturbed
countenances
became
calm
soldiers
and
officers
greeted
him
gaily
grew
more
cheerful
in
his
presence
and
were
evidently
anxious
to
display
their
courage
before
him
chapter
xviii
prince
bagration
having
reached
the
highest
point
of
our
right
flank
began
riding
downhill
to
where
the
roll
of
musketry
was
heard
but
where
on
account
of
the
smoke
nothing
could
be
seen
the
nearer
they
got
to
the
hollow
the
less
they
could
see
but
the
more
they
felt
the
nearness
of
the
actual
battlefield
they
began
to
meet
wounded
men
one
with
a
bleeding
head
and
no
cap
was
being
dragged
along
by
two
soldiers
who
supported
him
under
the
arms
there
was
a
gurgle
in
his
throat
and
he
was
spitting
blood
a
bullet
had
evidently
hit
him
in
the
throat
or
mouth
another
was
walking
sturdily
by
himself
but
without
his
musket
groaning
aloud
and
swinging
his
arm
which
had
just
been
hurt
while
blood
from
it
was
streaming
over
his
greatcoat
as
from
a
bottle
he
had
that
moment
been
wounded
and
his
face
showed
fear
rather
than
suffering
crossing
a
road
they
descended
a
steep
incline
and
saw
several
men
lying
on
the
ground
they
also
met
a
crowd
of
soldiers
some
of
whom
were
unwounded
the
soldiers
were
ascending
the
hill
breathing
heavily
and
despite
the
general
s
presence
were
talking
loudly
and
gesticulating
in
front
of
them
rows
of
gray
cloaks
were
already
visible
through
the
smoke
and
an
officer
catching
sight
of
bagration
rushed
shouting
after
the
crowd
of
retreating
soldiers
ordering
them
back
bagration
rode
up
to
the
ranks
along
which
shots
crackled
now
here
and
now
there
drowning
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
shouts
of
command
the
whole
air
reeked
with
smoke
the
excited
faces
of
the
soldiers
were
blackened
with
it
some
were
using
their
ramrods
others
putting
powder
on
the
touchpans
or
taking
charges
from
their
pouches
while
others
were
firing
though
who
they
were
firing
at
could
not
be
seen
for
the
smoke
which
there
was
no
wind
to
carry
away
a
pleasant
humming
and
whistling
of
bullets
were
often
heard
what
is
this
thought
prince
andrew
approaching
the
crowd
of
soldiers
it
can
t
be
an
attack
for
they
are
not
moving
it
can
t
be
a
square
for
they
are
not
drawn
up
for
that
the
commander
of
the
regiment
a
thin
feeble
looking
old
man
with
a
pleasant
smile
his
eyelids
drooping
more
than
half
over
his
old
eyes
giving
him
a
mild
expression
rode
up
to
bagration
and
welcomed
him
as
a
host
welcomes
an
honored
guest
he
reported
that
his
regiment
had
been
attacked
by
french
cavalry
and
that
though
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
he
had
lost
more
than
half
his
men
he
said
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
employing
this
military
term
to
describe
what
had
occurred
to
his
regiment
but
in
reality
he
did
not
himself
know
what
had
happened
during
that
half
hour
to
the
troops
entrusted
to
him
and
could
not
say
with
certainty
whether
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
or
his
regiment
had
been
broken
up
all
he
knew
was
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
action
balls
and
shells
began
flying
all
over
his
regiment
and
hitting
men
and
that
afterwards
someone
had
shouted
cavalry
and
our
men
had
begun
firing
they
were
still
firing
not
at
the
cavalry
which
had
disappeared
but
at
french
infantry
who
had
come
into
the
hollow
and
were
firing
at
our
men
prince
bagration
bowed
his
head
as
a
sign
that
this
was
exactly
what
he
had
desired
and
expected
turning
to
his
adjutant
he
ordered
him
to
bring
down
the
two
battalions
of
the
sixth
chasseurs
whom
they
had
just
passed
prince
andrew
was
struck
by
the
changed
expression
on
prince
bagration
s
face
at
this
moment
it
expressed
the
concentrated
and
happy
resolution
you
see
on
the
face
of
a
man
who
on
a
hot
day
takes
a
final
run
before
plunging
into
the
water
the
dull
sleepy
expression
was
no
longer
there
nor
the
affectation
of
profound
thought
the
round
steady
hawk
s
eyes
looked
before
him
eagerly
and
rather
disdainfully
not
resting
on
anything
although
his
movements
were
still
slow
and
measured
the
commander
of
the
regiment
turned
to
prince
bagration
entreating
him
to
go
back
as
it
was
too
dangerous
to
remain
where
they
were
please
your
excellency
for
god
s
sake
he
kept
saying
glancing
for
support
at
an
officer
of
the
suite
who
turned
away
from
him
there
you
see
and
he
drew
attention
to
the
bullets
whistling
singing
and
hissing
continually
around
them
he
spoke
in
the
tone
of
entreaty
and
reproach
that
a
carpenter
uses
to
a
gentleman
who
has
picked
up
an
ax
we
are
used
to
it
but
you
sir
will
blister
your
hands
he
spoke
as
if
those
bullets
could
not
kill
him
and
his
half
closed
eyes
gave
still
more
persuasiveness
to
his
words
the
staff
officer
joined
in
the
colonel
s
appeals
but
bagration
did
not
reply
he
only
gave
an
order
to
cease
firing
and
re
form
so
as
to
give
room
for
the
two
approaching
battalions
while
he
was
speaking
the
curtain
of
smoke
that
had
concealed
the
hollow
driven
by
a
rising
wind
began
to
move
from
right
to
left
as
if
drawn
by
an
invisible
hand
and
the
hill
opposite
with
the
french
moving
about
on
it
opened
out
before
them
all
eyes
fastened
involuntarily
on
this
french
column
advancing
against
them
and
winding
down
over
the
uneven
ground
one
could
already
see
the
soldiers
shaggy
caps
distinguish
the
officers
from
the
men
and
see
the
standard
flapping
against
its
staff
they
march
splendidly
remarked
someone
in
bagration
s
suite
the
head
of
the
column
had
already
descended
into
the
hollow
the
clash
would
take
place
on
this
side
of
it
the
remains
of
our
regiment
which
had
been
in
action
rapidly
formed
up
and
moved
to
the
right
from
behind
it
dispersing
the
laggards
came
two
battalions
of
the
sixth
chasseurs
in
fine
order
before
they
had
reached
bagration
the
weighty
tread
of
the
mass
of
men
marching
in
step
could
be
heard
on
their
left
flank
nearest
to
bagration
marched
a
company
commander
a
fine
round
faced
man
with
a
stupid
and
happy
expression
the
same
man
who
had
rushed
out
of
the
wattle
shed
at
that
moment
he
was
clearly
thinking
of
nothing
but
how
dashing
a
fellow
he
would
appear
as
he
passed
the
commander
with
the
self
satisfaction
of
a
man
on
parade
he
stepped
lightly
with
his
muscular
legs
as
if
sailing
along
stretching
himself
to
his
full
height
without
the
smallest
effort
his
ease
contrasting
with
the
heavy
tread
of
the
soldiers
who
were
keeping
step
with
him
he
carried
close
to
his
leg
a
narrow
unsheathed
sword
small
curved
and
not
like
a
real
weapon
and
looked
now
at
the
superior
officers
and
now
back
at
the
men
without
losing
step
his
whole
powerful
body
turning
flexibly
it
was
as
if
all
the
powers
of
his
soul
were
concentrated
on
passing
the
commander
in
the
best
possible
manner
and
feeling
that
he
was
doing
it
well
he
was
happy
left
left
left
he
seemed
to
repeat
to
himself
at
each
alternate
step
and
in
time
to
this
with
stern
but
varied
faces
the
wall
of
soldiers
burdened
with
knapsacks
and
muskets
marched
in
step
and
each
one
of
these
hundreds
of
soldiers
seemed
to
be
repeating
to
himself
at
each
alternate
step
left
left
left
a
fat
major
skirted
a
bush
puffing
and
falling
out
of
step
a
soldier
who
had
fallen
behind
his
face
showing
alarm
at
his
defection
ran
at
a
trot
panting
to
catch
up
with
his
company
a
cannon
ball
cleaving
the
air
flew
over
the
heads
of
bagration
and
his
suite
and
fell
into
the
column
to
the
measure
of
left
left
close
up
came
the
company
commander
s
voice
in
jaunty
tones
the
soldiers
passed
in
a
semicircle
round
something
where
the
ball
had
fallen
and
an
old
trooper
on
the
flank
a
noncommissioned
officer
who
had
stopped
beside
the
dead
men
ran
to
catch
up
his
line
and
falling
into
step
with
a
hop
looked
back
angrily
and
through
the
ominous
silence
and
the
regular
tramp
of
feet
beating
the
ground
in
unison
one
seemed
to
hear
left
left
left
well
done
lads
said
prince
bagration
glad
to
do
our
best
your
ex
len
lency
came
a
confused
shout
from
the
ranks
a
morose
soldier
marching
on
the
left
turned
his
eyes
on
bagration
as
he
shouted
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
we
know
that
ourselves
another
without
looking
round
as
though
fearing
to
relax
shouted
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
passed
on
the
order
was
given
to
halt
and
down
knapsacks
bagration
rode
round
the
ranks
that
had
marched
past
him
and
dismounted
he
gave
the
reins
to
a
cossack
took
off
and
handed
over
his
felt
coat
stretched
his
legs
and
set
his
cap
straight
the
head
of
the
french
column
with
its
officers
leading
appeared
from
below
the
hill
forward
with
god
said
bagration
in
a
resolute
sonorous
voice
turning
for
a
moment
to
the
front
line
and
slightly
swinging
his
arms
he
went
forward
uneasily
over
the
rough
field
with
the
awkward
gait
of
a
cavalryman
prince
andrew
felt
that
an
invisible
power
was
leading
him
forward
and
experienced
great
happiness
the
french
were
already
near
prince
andrew
walking
beside
bagration
could
clearly
distinguish
their
bandoliers
red
epaulets
and
even
their
faces
he
distinctly
saw
an
old
french
officer
who
with
gaitered
legs
and
turned
out
toes
climbed
the
hill
with
difficulty
prince
bagration
gave
no
further
orders
and
silently
continued
to
walk
on
in
front
of
the
ranks
suddenly
one
shot
after
another
rang
out
from
the
french
smoke
appeared
all
along
their
uneven
ranks
and
musket
shots
sounded
several
of
our
men
fell
among
them
the
round
faced
officer
who
had
marched
so
gaily
and
complacently
but
at
the
moment
the
first
report
was
heard
bagration
looked
round
and
shouted
hurrah
hurrah
ah
ah
rang
a
long
drawn
shout
from
our
ranks
and
passing
bagration
and
racing
one
another
they
rushed
in
an
irregular
but
joyous
and
eager
crowd
down
the
hill
at
their
disordered
foe
chapter
xix
the
attack
of
the
sixth
chasseurs
secured
the
retreat
of
our
right
flank
in
the
center
tushin
s
forgotten
battery
which
had
managed
to
set
fire
to
the
schon
grabern
village
delayed
the
french
advance
the
french
were
putting
out
the
fire
which
the
wind
was
spreading
and
thus
gave
us
time
to
retreat
the
retirement
of
the
center
to
the
other
side
of
the
dip
in
the
ground
at
the
rear
was
hurried
and
noisy
but
the
different
companies
did
not
get
mixed
but
our
left
which
consisted
of
the
azov
and
podolsk
infantry
and
the
pavlograd
hussars
was
simultaneously
attacked
and
outflanked
by
superior
french
forces
under
lannes
and
was
thrown
into
confusion
bagration
had
sent
zherkov
to
the
general
commanding
that
left
flank
with
orders
to
retreat
immediately
zherkov
not
removing
his
hand
from
his
cap
turned
his
horse
about
and
galloped
off
but
no
sooner
had
he
left
bagration
than
his
courage
failed
him
he
was
seized
by
panic
and
could
not
go
where
it
was
dangerous
having
reached
the
left
flank
instead
of
going
to
the
front
where
the
firing
was
he
began
to
look
for
the
general
and
his
staff
where
they
could
not
possibly
be
and
so
did
not
deliver
the
order
the
command
of
the
left
flank
belonged
by
seniority
to
the
commander
of
the
regiment
kutuzov
had
reviewed
at
braunau
and
in
which
dolokhov
was
serving
as
a
private
but
the
command
of
the
extreme
left
flank
had
been
assigned
to
the
commander
of
the
pavlograd
regiment
in
which
rostov
was
serving
and
a
misunderstanding
arose
the
two
commanders
were
much
exasperated
with
one
another
and
long
after
the
action
had
begun
on
the
right
flank
and
the
french
were
already
advancing
were
engaged
in
discussion
with
the
sole
object
of
offending
one
another
but
the
regiments
both
cavalry
and
infantry
were
by
no
means
ready
for
the
impending
action
from
privates
to
general
they
were
not
expecting
a
battle
and
were
engaged
in
peaceful
occupations
the
cavalry
feeding
the
horses
and
the
infantry
collecting
wood
he
higher
iss
dan
i
in
rank
said
the
german
colonel
of
the
hussars
flushing
and
addressing
an
adjutant
who
had
ridden
up
so
let
him
do
what
he
vill
but
i
cannot
sacrifice
my
hussars
bugler
sount
ze
retreat
but
haste
was
becoming
imperative
cannon
and
musketry
mingling
together
thundered
on
the
right
and
in
the
center
while
the
capotes
of
lannes
sharpshooters
were
already
seen
crossing
the
milldam
and
forming
up
within
twice
the
range
of
a
musket
shot
the
general
in
command
of
the
infantry
went
toward
his
horse
with
jerky
steps
and
having
mounted
drew
himself
up
very
straight
and
tall
and
rode
to
the
pavlograd
commander
the
commanders
met
with
polite
bows
but
with
secret
malevolence
in
their
hearts
once
again
colonel
said
the
general
i
can
t
leave
half
my
men
in
the
wood
i
beg
of
you
i
beg
of
you
he
repeated
to
occupy
the
position
and
prepare
for
an
attack
i
peg
of
you
yourself
not
to
mix
in
vot
is
not
your
business
suddenly
replied
the
irate
colonel
if
you
vere
in
the
cavalry
i
am
not
in
the
cavalry
colonel
but
i
am
a
russian
general
and
if
you
are
not
aware
of
the
fact
quite
avare
your
excellency
suddenly
shouted
the
colonel
touching
his
horse
and
turning
purple
in
the
face
vill
you
be
so
goot
to
come
to
ze
front
and
see
dat
zis
position
iss
no
goot
i
don
t
vish
to
destroy
my
men
for
your
pleasure
you
forget
yourself
colonel
i
am
not
considering
my
own
pleasure
and
i
won
t
allow
it
to
be
said
taking
the
colonel
s
outburst
as
a
challenge
to
his
courage
the
general
expanded
his
chest
and
rode
frowning
beside
him
to
the
front
line
as
if
their
differences
would
be
settled
there
amongst
the
bullets
they
reached
the
front
several
bullets
sped
over
them
and
they
halted
in
silence
there
was
nothing
fresh
to
be
seen
from
the
line
for
from
where
they
had
been
before
it
had
been
evident
that
it
was
impossible
for
cavalry
to
act
among
the
bushes
and
broken
ground
as
well
as
that
the
french
were
outflanking
our
left
the
general
and
colonel
looked
sternly
and
significantly
at
one
another
like
two
fighting
cocks
preparing
for
battle
each
vainly
trying
to
detect
signs
of
cowardice
in
the
other
both
passed
the
examination
successfully
as
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
and
neither
wished
to
give
occasion
for
it
to
be
alleged
that
he
had
been
the
first
to
leave
the
range
of
fire
they
would
have
remained
there
for
a
long
time
testing
each
other
s
courage
had
it
not
been
that
just
then
they
heard
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
a
muffled
shout
almost
behind
them
in
the
wood
the
french
had
attacked
the
men
collecting
wood
in
the
copse
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
the
hussars
to
retreat
with
the
infantry
they
were
cut
off
from
the
line
of
retreat
on
the
left
by
the
french
however
inconvenient
the
position
it
was
now
necessary
to
attack
in
order
to
cut
a
way
through
for
themselves
the
squadron
in
which
rostov
was
serving
had
scarcely
time
to
mount
before
it
was
halted
facing
the
enemy
again
as
at
the
enns
bridge
there
was
nothing
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
and
again
that
terrible
dividing
line
of
uncertainty
and
fear
resembling
the
line
separating
the
living
from
the
dead
lay
between
them
all
were
conscious
of
this
unseen
line
and
the
question
whether
they
would
cross
it
or
not
and
how
they
would
cross
it
agitated
them
all
the
colonel
rode
to
the
front
angrily
gave
some
reply
to
questions
put
to
him
by
the
officers
and
like
a
man
desperately
insisting
on
having
his
own
way
gave
an
order
no
one
said
anything
definite
but
the
rumor
of
an
attack
spread
through
the
squadron
the
command
to
form
up
rang
out
and
the
sabers
whizzed
as
they
were
drawn
from
their
scabbards
still
no
one
moved
the
troops
of
the
left
flank
infantry
and
hussars
alike
felt
that
the
commander
did
not
himself
know
what
to
do
and
this
irresolution
communicated
itself
to
the
men
if
only
they
would
be
quick
thought
rostov
feeling
that
at
last
the
time
had
come
to
experience
the
joy
of
an
attack
of
which
he
had
so
often
heard
from
his
fellow
hussars
fo
ward
with
god
lads
rang
out
denisov
s
voice
at
a
twot
fo
ward
the
horses
croups
began
to
sway
in
the
front
line
rook
pulled
at
the
reins
and
started
of
his
own
accord
before
him
on
the
right
rostov
saw
the
front
lines
of
his
hussars
and
still
farther
ahead
a
dark
line
which
he
could
not
see
distinctly
but
took
to
be
the
enemy
shots
could
be
heard
but
some
way
off
faster
came
the
word
of
command
and
rostov
felt
rook
s
flanks
drooping
as
he
broke
into
a
gallop
rostov
anticipated
his
horse
s
movements
and
became
more
and
more
elated
he
had
noticed
a
solitary
tree
ahead
of
him
this
tree
had
been
in
the
middle
of
the
line
that
had
seemed
so
terrible
and
now
he
had
crossed
that
line
and
not
only
was
there
nothing
terrible
but
everything
was
becoming
more
and
more
happy
and
animated
oh
how
i
will
slash
at
him
thought
rostov
gripping
the
hilt
of
his
saber
hur
a
a
a
ah
came
a
roar
of
voices
let
anyone
come
my
way
now
thought
rostov
driving
his
spurs
into
rook
and
letting
him
go
at
a
full
gallop
so
that
he
outstripped
the
others
ahead
the
enemy
was
already
visible
suddenly
something
like
a
birch
broom
seemed
to
sweep
over
the
squadron
rostov
raised
his
saber
ready
to
strike
but
at
that
instant
the
trooper
nikitenko
who
was
galloping
ahead
shot
away
from
him
and
rostov
felt
as
in
a
dream
that
he
continued
to
be
carried
forward
with
unnatural
speed
but
yet
stayed
on
the
same
spot
from
behind
him
bondarchuk
an
hussar
he
knew
jolted
against
him
and
looked
angrily
at
him
bondarchuk
s
horse
swerved
and
galloped
past
how
is
it
i
am
not
moving
i
have
fallen
i
am
killed
rostov
asked
and
answered
at
the
same
instant
he
was
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
field
instead
of
the
moving
horses
and
hussars
backs
he
saw
nothing
before
him
but
the
motionless
earth
and
the
stubble
around
him
there
was
warm
blood
under
his
arm
no
i
am
wounded
and
the
horse
is
killed
rook
tried
to
rise
on
his
forelegs
but
fell
back
pinning
his
rider
s
leg
blood
was
flowing
from
his
head
he
struggled
but
could
not
rise
rostov
also
tried
to
rise
but
fell
back
his
sabretache
having
become
entangled
in
the
saddle
where
our
men
were
and
where
the
french
he
did
not
know
there
was
no
one
near
having
disentangled
his
leg
he
rose
where
on
which
side
was
now
the
line
that
had
so
sharply
divided
the
two
armies
he
asked
himself
and
could
not
answer
can
something
bad
have
happened
to
me
he
wondered
as
he
got
up
and
at
that
moment
he
felt
that
something
superfluous
was
hanging
on
his
benumbed
left
arm
the
wrist
felt
as
if
it
were
not
his
he
examined
his
hand
carefully
vainly
trying
to
find
blood
on
it
ah
here
are
people
coming
he
thought
joyfully
seeing
some
men
running
toward
him
they
will
help
me
in
front
came
a
man
wearing
a
strange
shako
and
a
blue
cloak
swarthy
sunburned
and
with
a
hooked
nose
then
came
two
more
and
many
more
running
behind
one
of
them
said
something
strange
not
in
russian
in
among
the
hindmost
of
these
men
wearing
similar
shakos
was
a
russian
hussar
he
was
being
held
by
the
arms
and
his
horse
was
being
led
behind
him
it
must
be
one
of
ours
a
prisoner
yes
can
it
be
that
they
will
take
me
too
who
are
these
men
thought
rostov
scarcely
believing
his
eyes
can
they
be
french
he
looked
at
the
approaching
frenchmen
and
though
but
a
moment
before
he
had
been
galloping
to
get
at
them
and
hack
them
to
pieces
their
proximity
now
seemed
so
awful
that
he
could
not
believe
his
eyes
who
are
they
why
are
they
running
can
they
be
coming
at
me
and
why
to
kill
me
me
whom
everyone
is
so
fond
of
he
remembered
his
mother
s
love
for
him
and
his
family
s
and
his
friends
and
the
enemy
s
intention
to
kill
him
seemed
impossible
but
perhaps
they
may
do
it
for
more
than
ten
seconds
he
stood
not
moving
from
the
spot
or
realizing
the
situation
the
foremost
frenchman
the
one
with
the
hooked
nose
was
already
so
close
that
the
expression
of
his
face
could
be
seen
and
the
excited
alien
face
of
that
man
his
bayonet
hanging
down
holding
his
breath
and
running
so
lightly
frightened
rostov
he
seized
his
pistol
and
instead
of
firing
it
flung
it
at
the
frenchman
and
ran
with
all
his
might
toward
the
bushes
he
did
not
now
run
with
the
feeling
of
doubt
and
conflict
with
which
he
had
trodden
the
enns
bridge
but
with
the
feeling
of
a
hare
fleeing
from
the
hounds
one
single
sentiment
that
of
fear
for
his
young
and
happy
life
possessed
his
whole
being
rapidly
leaping
the
furrows
he
fled
across
the
field
with
the
impetuosity
he
used
to
show
at
catchplay
now
and
then
turning
his
good
natured
pale
young
face
to
look
back
a
shudder
of
terror
went
through
him
no
better
not
look
he
thought
but
having
reached
the
bushes
he
glanced
round
once
more
the
french
had
fallen
behind
and
just
as
he
looked
round
the
first
man
changed
his
run
to
a
walk
and
turning
shouted
something
loudly
to
a
comrade
farther
back
rostov
paused
no
there
s
some
mistake
thought
he
they
can
t
have
wanted
to
kill
me
but
at
the
same
time
his
left
arm
felt
as
heavy
as
if
a
seventy
pound
weight
were
tied
to
it
he
could
run
no
more
the
frenchman
also
stopped
and
took
aim
rostov
closed
his
eyes
and
stooped
down
one
bullet
and
then
another
whistled
past
him
he
mustered
his
last
remaining
strength
took
hold
of
his
left
hand
with
his
right
and
reached
the
bushes
behind
these
were
some
russian
sharpshooters
chapter
xx
the
infantry
regiments
that
had
been
caught
unawares
in
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
ran
out
of
it
the
different
companies
getting
mixed
and
retreated
as
a
disorderly
crowd
one
soldier
in
his
fear
uttered
the
senseless
cry
cut
off
that
is
so
terrible
in
battle
and
that
word
infected
the
whole
crowd
with
a
feeling
of
panic
surrounded
cut
off
we
re
lost
shouted
the
fugitives
the
moment
he
heard
the
firing
and
the
cry
from
behind
the
general
realized
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
to
his
regiment
and
the
thought
that
he
an
exemplary
officer
of
many
years
service
who
had
never
been
to
blame
might
be
held
responsible
at
headquarters
for
negligence
or
inefficiency
so
staggered
him
that
forgetting
the
recalcitrant
cavalry
colonel
his
own
dignity
as
a
general
and
above
all
quite
forgetting
the
danger
and
all
regard
for
self
preservation
he
clutched
the
crupper
of
his
saddle
and
spurring
his
horse
galloped
to
the
regiment
under
a
hail
of
bullets
which
fell
around
but
fortunately
missed
him
his
one
desire
was
to
know
what
was
happening
and
at
any
cost
correct
or
remedy
the
mistake
if
he
had
made
one
so
that
he
an
exemplary
officer
of
twenty
two
years
service
who
had
never
been
censured
should
not
be
held
to
blame
having
galloped
safely
through
the
french
he
reached
a
field
behind
the
copse
across
which
our
men
regardless
of
orders
were
running
and
descending
the
valley
that
moment
of
moral
hesitation
which
decides
the
fate
of
battles
had
arrived
would
this
disorderly
crowd
of
soldiers
attend
to
the
voice
of
their
commander
or
would
they
disregarding
him
continue
their
flight
despite
his
desperate
shouts
that
used
to
seem
so
terrible
to
the
soldiers
despite
his
furious
purple
countenance
distorted
out
of
all
likeness
to
his
former
self
and
the
flourishing
of
his
saber
the
soldiers
all
continued
to
run
talking
firing
into
the
air
and
disobeying
orders
the
moral
hesitation
which
decided
the
fate
of
battles
was
evidently
culminating
in
a
panic
the
general
had
a
fit
of
coughing
as
a
result
of
shouting
and
of
the
powder
smoke
and
stopped
in
despair
everything
seemed
lost
but
at
that
moment
the
french
who
were
attacking
suddenly
and
without
any
apparent
reason
ran
back
and
disappeared
from
the
outskirts
and
russian
sharpshooters
showed
themselves
in
the
copse
it
was
timokhin
s
company
which
alone
had
maintained
its
order
in
the
wood
and
having
lain
in
ambush
in
a
ditch
now
attacked
the
french
unexpectedly
timokhin
armed
only
with
a
sword
had
rushed
at
the
enemy
with
such
a
desperate
cry
and
such
mad
drunken
determination
that
taken
by
surprise
the
french
had
thrown
down
their
muskets
and
run
dolokhov
running
beside
timokhin
killed
a
frenchman
at
close
quarters
and
was
the
first
to
seize
the
surrendering
french
officer
by
his
collar
our
fugitives
returned
the
battalions
re
formed
and
the
french
who
had
nearly
cut
our
left
flank
in
half
were
for
the
moment
repulsed
our
reserve
units
were
able
to
join
up
and
the
fight
was
at
an
end
the
regimental
commander
and
major
ekonomov
had
stopped
beside
a
bridge
letting
the
retreating
companies
pass
by
them
when
a
soldier
came
up
and
took
hold
of
the
commander
s
stirrup
almost
leaning
against
him
the
man
was
wearing
a
bluish
coat
of
broadcloth
he
had
no
knapsack
or
cap
his
head
was
bandaged
and
over
his
shoulder
a
french
munition
pouch
was
slung
he
had
an
officer
s
sword
in
his
hand
the
soldier
was
pale
his
blue
eyes
looked
impudently
into
the
commander
s
face
and
his
lips
were
smiling
though
the
commander
was
occupied
in
giving
instructions
to
major
ekonomov
he
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
the
soldier
your
excellency
here
are
two
trophies
said
dolokhov
pointing
to
the
french
sword
and
pouch
i
have
taken
an
officer
prisoner
i
stopped
the
company
dolokhov
breathed
heavily
from
weariness
and
spoke
in
abrupt
sentences
the
whole
company
can
bear
witness
i
beg
you
will
remember
this
your
excellency
all
right
all
right
replied
the
commander
and
turned
to
major
ekonomov
but
dolokhov
did
not
go
away
he
untied
the
handkerchief
around
his
head
pulled
it
off
and
showed
the
blood
congealed
on
his
hair
a
bayonet
wound
i
remained
at
the
front
remember
your
excellency
tushin
s
battery
had
been
forgotten
and
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
action
did
prince
bagration
still
hearing
the
cannonade
in
the
center
send
his
orderly
staff
officer
and
later
prince
andrew
also
to
order
the
battery
to
retire
as
quickly
as
possible
when
the
supports
attached
to
tushin
s
battery
had
been
moved
away
in
the
middle
of
the
action
by
someone
s
order
the
battery
had
continued
firing
and
was
only
not
captured
by
the
french
because
the
enemy
could
not
surmise
that
anyone
could
have
the
effrontery
to
continue
firing
from
four
quite
undefended
guns
on
the
contrary
the
energetic
action
of
that
battery
led
the
french
to
suppose
that
here
in
the
center
the
main
russian
forces
were
concentrated
twice
they
had
attempted
to
attack
this
point
but
on
each
occasion
had
been
driven
back
by
grapeshot
from
the
four
isolated
guns
on
the
hillock
soon
after
prince
bagration
had
left
him
tushin
had
succeeded
in
setting
fire
to
schon
grabern
look
at
them
scurrying
it
s
burning
just
see
the
smoke
fine
grand
look
at
the
smoke
the
smoke
exclaimed
the
artillerymen
brightening
up
all
the
guns
without
waiting
for
orders
were
being
fired
in
the
direction
of
the
conflagration
as
if
urging
each
other
on
the
soldiers
cried
at
each
shot
fine
that
s
good
look
at
it
grand
the
fire
fanned
by
the
breeze
was
rapidly
spreading
the
french
columns
that
had
advanced
beyond
the
village
went
back
but
as
though
in
revenge
for
this
failure
the
enemy
placed
ten
guns
to
the
right
of
the
village
and
began
firing
them
at
tushin
s
battery
in
their
childlike
glee
aroused
by
the
fire
and
their
luck
in
successfully
cannonading
the
french
our
artillerymen
only
noticed
this
battery
when
two
balls
and
then
four
more
fell
among
our
guns
one
knocking
over
two
horses
and
another
tearing
off
a
munition
wagon
driver
s
leg
their
spirits
once
roused
were
however
not
diminished
but
only
changed
character
the
horses
were
replaced
by
others
from
a
reserve
gun
carriage
the
wounded
were
carried
away
and
the
four
guns
were
turned
against
the
ten
gun
battery
tushin
s
companion
officer
had
been
killed
at
the
beginning
of
the
engagement
and
within
an
hour
seventeen
of
the
forty
men
of
the
guns
crews
had
been
disabled
but
the
artillerymen
were
still
as
merry
and
lively
as
ever
twice
they
noticed
the
french
appearing
below
them
and
then
they
fired
grapeshot
at
them
little
tushin
moving
feebly
and
awkwardly
kept
telling
his
orderly
to
refill
my
pipe
for
that
one
and
then
scattering
sparks
from
it
ran
forward
shading
his
eyes
with
his
small
hand
to
look
at
the
french
smack
at
em
lads
he
kept
saying
seizing
the
guns
by
the
wheels
and
working
the
screws
himself
amid
the
smoke
deafened
by
the
incessant
reports
which
always
made
him
jump
tushin
not
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
ran
from
gun
to
gun
now
aiming
now
counting
the
charges
now
giving
orders
about
replacing
dead
or
wounded
horses
and
harnessing
fresh
ones
and
shouting
in
his
feeble
voice
so
high
pitched
and
irresolute
his
face
grew
more
and
more
animated
only
when
a
man
was
killed
or
wounded
did
he
frown
and
turn
away
from
the
sight
shouting
angrily
at
the
men
who
as
is
always
the
case
hesitated
about
lifting
the
injured
or
dead
the
soldiers
for
the
most
part
handsome
fellows
and
as
is
always
the
case
in
an
artillery
company
a
head
and
shoulders
taller
and
twice
as
broad
as
their
officer
all
looked
at
their
commander
like
children
in
an
embarrassing
situation
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
invariably
reflected
on
theirs
owing
to
the
terrible
uproar
and
the
necessity
for
concentration
and
activity
tushin
did
not
experience
the
slightest
unpleasant
sense
of
fear
and
the
thought
that
he
might
be
killed
or
badly
wounded
never
occurred
to
him
on
the
contrary
he
became
more
and
more
elated
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
a
very
long
time
ago
almost
a
day
since
he
had
first
seen
the
enemy
and
fired
the
first
shot
and
that
the
corner
of
the
field
he
stood
on
was
well
known
and
familiar
ground
though
he
thought
of
everything
considered
everything
and
did
everything
the
best
of
officers
could
do
in
his
position
he
was
in
a
state
akin
to
feverish
delirium
or
drunkenness
from
the
deafening
sounds
of
his
own
guns
around
him
the
whistle
and
thud
of
the
enemy
s
cannon
balls
from
the
flushed
and
perspiring
faces
of
the
crew
bustling
round
the
guns
from
the
sight
of
the
blood
of
men
and
horses
from
the
little
puffs
of
smoke
on
the
enemy
s
side
always
followed
by
a
ball
flying
past
and
striking
the
earth
a
man
a
gun
a
horse
from
the
sight
of
all
these
things
a
fantastic
world
of
his
own
had
taken
possession
of
his
brain
and
at
that
moment
afforded
him
pleasure
the
enemy
s
guns
were
in
his
fancy
not
guns
but
pipes
from
which
occasional
puffs
were
blown
by
an
invisible
smoker
there
he
s
puffing
again
muttered
tushin
to
himself
as
a
small
cloud
rose
from
the
hill
and
was
borne
in
a
streak
to
the
left
by
the
wind
now
look
out
for
the
ball
we
ll
throw
it
back
what
do
you
want
your
honor
asked
an
artilleryman
standing
close
by
who
heard
him
muttering
nothing
only
a
shell
he
answered
come
along
our
matvevna
he
said
to
himself
matvevna
was
the
name
his
fancy
gave
to
the
farthest
gun
of
the
battery
which
was
large
and
of
an
old
pattern
the
french
swarming
round
their
guns
seemed
to
him
like
ants
in
that
world
the
handsome
drunkard
number
one
of
the
second
gun
s
crew
was
uncle
tushin
looked
at
him
more
often
than
at
anyone
else
and
took
delight
in
his
every
movement
the
sound
of
musketry
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
now
diminishing
now
increasing
seemed
like
someone
s
breathing
he
listened
intently
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
these
sounds
daughter
of
matthew
ah
breathing
again
breathing
he
muttered
to
himself
he
imagined
himself
as
an
enormously
tall
powerful
man
who
was
throwing
cannon
balls
at
the
french
with
both
hands
now
then
matvevna
dear
old
lady
don
t
let
me
down
he
was
saying
as
he
moved
from
the
gun
when
a
strange
unfamiliar
voice
called
above
his
head
captain
tushin
captain
tushin
turned
round
in
dismay
it
was
the
staff
officer
who
had
turned
him
out
of
the
booth
at
grunth
he
was
shouting
in
a
gasping
voice
are
you
mad
you
have
twice
been
ordered
to
retreat
and
you
why
are
they
down
on
me
thought
tushin
looking
in
alarm
at
his
superior
i
don
t
he
muttered
holding
up
two
fingers
to
his
cap
i
but
the
staff
officer
did
not
finish
what
he
wanted
to
say
a
cannon
ball
flying
close
to
him
caused
him
to
duck
and
bend
over
his
horse
he
paused
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
say
something
more
another
ball
stopped
him
he
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
off
retire
all
to
retire
he
shouted
from
a
distance
the
soldiers
laughed
a
moment
later
an
adjutant
arrived
with
the
same
order
it
was
prince
andrew
the
first
thing
he
saw
on
riding
up
to
the
space
where
tushin
s
guns
were
stationed
was
an
unharnessed
horse
with
a
broken
leg
that
lay
screaming
piteously
beside
the
harnessed
horses
blood
was
gushing
from
its
leg
as
from
a
spring
among
the
limbers
lay
several
dead
men
one
ball
after
another
passed
over
as
he
approached
and
he
felt
a
nervous
shudder
run
down
his
spine
but
the
mere
thought
of
being
afraid
roused
him
again
i
cannot
be
afraid
thought
he
and
dismounted
slowly
among
the
guns
he
delivered
the
order
and
did
not
leave
the
battery
he
decided
to
have
the
guns
removed
from
their
positions
and
withdrawn
in
his
presence
together
with
tushin
stepping
across
the
bodies
and
under
a
terrible
fire
from
the
french
he
attended
to
the
removal
of
the
guns
a
staff
officer
was
here
a
minute
ago
but
skipped
off
said
an
artilleryman
to
prince
andrew
not
like
your
honor
prince
andrew
said
nothing
to
tushin
they
were
both
so
busy
as
to
seem
not
to
notice
one
another
when
having
limbered
up
the
only
two
cannon
that
remained
uninjured
out
of
the
four
they
began
moving
down
the
hill
one
shattered
gun
and
one
unicorn
were
left
behind
prince
andrew
rode
up
to
tushin
well
till
we
meet
again
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
to
tushin
good
by
my
dear
fellow
said
tushin
dear
soul
good
by
my
dear
fellow
and
for
some
unknown
reason
tears
suddenly
filled
his
eyes
chapter
xxi
the
wind
had
fallen
and
black
clouds
merging
with
the
powder
smoke
hung
low
over
the
field
of
battle
on
the
horizon
it
was
growing
dark
and
the
glow
of
two
conflagrations
was
the
more
conspicuous
the
cannonade
was
dying
down
but
the
rattle
of
musketry
behind
and
on
the
right
sounded
oftener
and
nearer
as
soon
as
tushin
with
his
guns
continually
driving
round
or
coming
upon
wounded
men
was
out
of
range
of
fire
and
had
descended
into
the
dip
he
was
met
by
some
of
the
staff
among
them
the
staff
officer
and
zherkov
who
had
been
twice
sent
to
tushin
s
battery
but
had
never
reached
it
interrupting
one
another
they
all
gave
and
transmitted
orders
as
to
how
to
proceed
reprimanding
and
reproaching
him
tushin
gave
no
orders
and
silently
fearing
to
speak
because
at
every
word
he
felt
ready
to
weep
without
knowing
why
rode
behind
on
his
artillery
nag
though
the
orders
were
to
abandon
the
wounded
many
of
them
dragged
themselves
after
troops
and
begged
for
seats
on
the
gun
carriages
the
jaunty
infantry
officer
who
just
before
the
battle
had
rushed
out
of
tushin
s
wattle
shed
was
laid
with
a
bullet
in
his
stomach
on
matvevna
s
carriage
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
a
pale
hussar
cadet
supporting
one
hand
with
the
other
came
up
to
tushin
and
asked
for
a
seat
captain
for
god
s
sake
i
ve
hurt
my
arm
he
said
timidly
for
god
s
sake
i
can
t
walk
for
god
s
sake
it
was
plain
that
this
cadet
had
already
repeatedly
asked
for
a
lift
and
been
refused
he
asked
in
a
hesitating
piteous
voice
tell
them
to
give
me
a
seat
for
god
s
sake
give
him
a
seat
said
tushin
lay
a
cloak
for
him
to
sit
on
lad
he
said
addressing
his
favorite
soldier
and
where
is
the
wounded
officer
he
has
been
set
down
he
died
replied
someone
help
him
up
sit
down
dear
fellow
sit
down
spread
out
the
cloak
antonov
the
cadet
was
rostov
with
one
hand
he
supported
the
other
he
was
pale
and
his
jaw
trembled
shivering
feverishly
he
was
placed
on
matvevna
the
gun
from
which
they
had
removed
the
dead
officer
the
cloak
they
spread
under
him
was
wet
with
blood
which
stained
his
breeches
and
arm
what
are
you
wounded
my
lad
said
tushin
approaching
the
gun
on
which
rostov
sat
no
it
s
a
sprain
then
what
is
this
blood
on
the
gun
carriage
inquired
tushin
it
was
the
officer
your
honor
stained
it
answered
the
artilleryman
wiping
away
the
blood
with
his
coat
sleeve
as
if
apologizing
for
the
state
of
his
gun
it
was
all
that
they
could
do
to
get
the
guns
up
the
rise
aided
by
the
infantry
and
having
reached
the
village
of
gruntersdorf
they
halted
it
had
grown
so
dark
that
one
could
not
distinguish
the
uniforms
ten
paces
off
and
the
firing
had
begun
to
subside
suddenly
near
by
on
the
right
shouting
and
firing
were
again
heard
flashes
of
shot
gleamed
in
the
darkness
this
was
the
last
french
attack
and
was
met
by
soldiers
who
had
sheltered
in
the
village
houses
they
all
rushed
out
of
the
village
again
but
tushin
s
guns
could
not
move
and
the
artillerymen
tushin
and
the
cadet
exchanged
silent
glances
as
they
awaited
their
fate
the
firing
died
down
and
soldiers
talking
eagerly
streamed
out
of
a
side
street
not
hurt
petrov
asked
one
we
ve
given
it
em
hot
mate
they
won
t
make
another
push
now
said
another
you
couldn
t
see
a
thing
how
they
shot
at
their
own
fellows
nothing
could
be
seen
pitch
dark
brother
isn
t
there
something
to
drink
the
french
had
been
repulsed
for
the
last
time
and
again
and
again
in
the
complete
darkness
tushin
s
guns
moved
forward
surrounded
by
the
humming
infantry
as
by
a
frame
in
the
darkness
it
seemed
as
though
a
gloomy
unseen
river
was
flowing
always
in
one
direction
humming
with
whispers
and
talk
and
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
amid
the
general
rumble
the
groans
and
voices
of
the
wounded
were
more
distinctly
heard
than
any
other
sound
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
the
gloom
that
enveloped
the
army
was
filled
with
their
groans
which
seemed
to
melt
into
one
with
the
darkness
of
the
night
after
a
while
the
moving
mass
became
agitated
someone
rode
past
on
a
white
horse
followed
by
his
suite
and
said
something
in
passing
what
did
he
say
where
to
now
halt
is
it
did
he
thank
us
came
eager
questions
from
all
sides
the
whole
moving
mass
began
pressing
closer
together
and
a
report
spread
that
they
were
ordered
to
halt
evidently
those
in
front
had
halted
all
remained
where
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
muddy
road
fires
were
lighted
and
the
talk
became
more
audible
captain
tushin
having
given
orders
to
his
company
sent
a
soldier
to
find
a
dressing
station
or
a
doctor
for
the
cadet
and
sat
down
by
a
bonfire
the
soldiers
had
kindled
on
the
road
rostov
too
dragged
himself
to
the
fire
from
pain
cold
and
damp
a
feverish
shivering
shook
his
whole
body
drowsiness
was
irresistibly
mastering
him
but
he
kept
awake
by
an
excruciating
pain
in
his
arm
for
which
he
could
find
no
satisfactory
position
he
kept
closing
his
eyes
and
then
again
looking
at
the
fire
which
seemed
to
him
dazzlingly
red
and
at
the
feeble
round
shouldered
figure
of
tushin
who
was
sitting
cross
legged
like
a
turk
beside
him
tushin
s
large
kind
intelligent
eyes
were
fixed
with
sympathy
and
commiseration
on
rostov
who
saw
that
tushin
with
his
whole
heart
wished
to
help
him
but
could
not
from
all
sides
were
heard
the
footsteps
and
talk
of
the
infantry
who
were
walking
driving
past
and
settling
down
all
around
the
sound
of
voices
the
tramping
feet
the
horses
hoofs
moving
in
mud
the
crackling
of
wood
fires
near
and
afar
merged
into
one
tremulous
rumble
it
was
no
longer
as
before
a
dark
unseen
river
flowing
through
the
gloom
but
a
dark
sea
swelling
and
gradually
subsiding
after
a
storm
rostov
looked
at
and
listened
listlessly
to
what
passed
before
and
around
him
an
infantryman
came
to
the
fire
squatted
on
his
heels
held
his
hands
to
the
blaze
and
turned
away
his
face
you
don
t
mind
your
honor
he
asked
tushin
i
ve
lost
my
company
your
honor
i
don
t
know
where
such
bad
luck
with
the
soldier
an
infantry
officer
with
a
bandaged
cheek
came
up
to
the
bonfire
and
addressing
tushin
asked
him
to
have
the
guns
moved
a
trifle
to
let
a
wagon
go
past
after
he
had
gone
two
soldiers
rushed
to
the
campfire
they
were
quarreling
and
fighting
desperately
each
trying
to
snatch
from
the
other
a
boot
they
were
both
holding
on
to
you
picked
it
up
i
dare
say
you
re
very
smart
one
of
them
shouted
hoarsely
then
a
thin
pale
soldier
his
neck
bandaged
with
a
bloodstained
leg
band
came
up
and
in
angry
tones
asked
the
artillerymen
for
water
must
one
die
like
a
dog
said
he
tushin
told
them
to
give
the
man
some
water
then
a
cheerful
soldier
ran
up
begging
a
little
fire
for
the
infantry
a
nice
little
hot
torch
for
the
infantry
good
luck
to
you
fellow
countrymen
thanks
for
the
fire
we
ll
return
it
with
interest
said
he
carrying
away
into
the
darkness
a
glowing
stick
next
came
four
soldiers
carrying
something
heavy
on
a
cloak
and
passed
by
the
fire
one
of
them
stumbled
who
the
devil
has
put
the
logs
on
the
road
snarled
he
he
s
dead
why
carry
him
said
another
shut
up
and
they
disappeared
into
the
darkness
with
their
load
still
aching
tushin
asked
rostov
in
a
whisper
yes
your
honor
you
re
wanted
by
the
general
he
is
in
the
hut
here
said
a
gunner
coming
up
to
tushin
coming
friend
tushin
rose
and
buttoning
his
greatcoat
and
pulling
it
straight
walked
away
from
the
fire
not
far
from
the
artillery
campfire
in
a
hut
that
had
been
prepared
for
him
prince
bagration
sat
at
dinner
talking
with
some
commanding
officers
who
had
gathered
at
his
quarters
the
little
old
man
with
the
half
closed
eyes
was
there
greedily
gnawing
a
mutton
bone
and
the
general
who
had
served
blamelessly
for
twenty
two
years
flushed
by
a
glass
of
vodka
and
the
dinner
and
the
staff
officer
with
the
signet
ring
and
zherkov
uneasily
glancing
at
them
all
and
prince
andrew
pale
with
compressed
lips
and
feverishly
glittering
eyes
in
a
corner
of
the
hut
stood
a
standard
captured
from
the
french
and
the
accountant
with
the
naive
face
was
feeling
its
texture
shaking
his
head
in
perplexity
perhaps
because
the
banner
really
interested
him
perhaps
because
it
was
hard
for
him
hungry
as
he
was
to
look
on
at
a
dinner
where
there
was
no
place
for
him
in
the
next
hut
there
was
a
french
colonel
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
our
dragoons
our
officers
were
flocking
in
to
look
at
him
prince
bagration
was
thanking
the
individual
commanders
and
inquiring
into
details
of
the
action
and
our
losses
the
general
whose
regiment
had
been
inspected
at
braunau
was
informing
the
prince
that
as
soon
as
the
action
began
he
had
withdrawn
from
the
wood
mustered
