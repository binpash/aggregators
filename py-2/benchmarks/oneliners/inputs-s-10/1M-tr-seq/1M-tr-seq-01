removed
from
their
positions
and
withdrawn
in
his
presence

Together
with
T

shin

stepping
across
the
bodies
and
under
a
terrible
fire
from
the
French

he
attended
to
the
removal
of
the
guns





A
staff
officer
was
here
a
minute
ago

but
skipped
off




said
an
artilleryman
to
Prince
Andrew




Not
like
your
honor





Prince
Andrew
said
nothing
to
T

shin

They
were
both
so
busy
as
to
seem
not
to
notice
one
another

When
having
limbered
up
the
only
two
cannon
that
remained
uninjured
out
of
the
four

they
began
moving
down
the
hill

one
shattered
gun
and
one
unicorn
were
left
behind


Prince
Andrew
rode
up
to
T

shin





Well

till
we
meet
again






he
said

holding
out
his
hand
to
T

shin





Good
by

my
dear
fellow




said
T

shin




Dear
soul

Good
by

my
dear
fellow




and
for
some
unknown
reason
tears
suddenly
filled
his
eyes






CHAPTER
XXI

The
wind
had
fallen
and
black
clouds

merging
with
the
powder
smoke

hung
low
over
the
field
of
battle
on
the
horizon

It
was
growing
dark
and
the
glow
of
two
conflagrations
was
the
more
conspicuous

The
cannonade
was
dying
down

but
the
rattle
of
musketry
behind
and
on
the
right
sounded
oftener
and
nearer

As
soon
as
T

shin
with
his
guns

continually
driving
round
or
coming
upon
wounded
men

was
out
of
range
of
fire
and
had
descended
into
the
dip

he
was
met
by
some
of
the
staff

among
them
the
staff
officer
and
Zherk

v

who
had
been
twice
sent
to
T

shin


s
battery
but
had
never
reached
it

Interrupting
one
another

they
all
gave

and
transmitted

orders
as
to
how
to
proceed

reprimanding
and
reproaching
him

T

shin
gave
no
orders

and

silently


fearing
to
speak
because
at
every
word
he
felt
ready
to
weep
without
knowing
why


rode
behind
on
his
artillery
nag

Though
the
orders
were
to
abandon
the
wounded

many
of
them
dragged
themselves
after
troops
and
begged
for
seats
on
the
gun
carriages

The
jaunty
infantry
officer
who
just
before
the
battle
had
rushed
out
of
T

shin


s
wattle
shed
was
laid

with
a
bullet
in
his
stomach

on



Matv

vna


s



carriage

At
the
foot
of
the
hill

a
pale
hussar
cadet

supporting
one
hand
with
the
other

came
up
to
T

shin
and
asked
for
a
seat





Captain

for
God


s
sake

I


ve
hurt
my
arm




he
said
timidly




For
God


s
sake



I
can


t
walk

For
God


s
sake





It
was
plain
that
this
cadet
had
already
repeatedly
asked
for
a
lift
and
been
refused

He
asked
in
a
hesitating

piteous
voice





Tell
them
to
give
me
a
seat

for
God


s
sake








Give
him
a
seat




said
T

shin




Lay
a
cloak
for
him
to
sit
on

lad




he
said

addressing
his
favorite
soldier




And
where
is
the
wounded
officer








He
has
been
set
down

He
died




replied
someone





Help
him
up

Sit
down

dear
fellow

sit
down

Spread
out
the
cloak

Ant

nov





The
cadet
was
Rost

v

With
one
hand
he
supported
the
other

he
was
pale
and
his
jaw
trembled

shivering
feverishly

He
was
placed
on



Matv

vna




the
gun
from
which
they
had
removed
the
dead
officer

The
cloak
they
spread
under
him
was
wet
with
blood
which
stained
his
breeches
and
arm





What

are
you
wounded

my
lad




said
T

shin

approaching
the
gun
on
which
Rost

v
sat





No

it


s
a
sprain








Then
what
is
this
blood
on
the
gun
carriage




inquired
T

shin





It
was
the
officer

your
honor

stained
it




answered
the
artilleryman

wiping
away
the
blood
with
his
coat
sleeve

as
if
apologizing
for
the
state
of
his
gun


It
was
all
that
they
could
do
to
get
the
guns
up
the
rise
aided
by
the
infantry

and
having
reached
the
village
of
Gruntersdorf
they
halted

It
had
grown
so
dark
that
one
could
not
distinguish
the
uniforms
ten
paces
off

and
the
firing
had
begun
to
subside

Suddenly

near
by
on
the
right

shouting
and
firing
were
again
heard

Flashes
of
shot
gleamed
in
the
darkness

This
was
the
last
French
attack
and
was
met
by
soldiers
who
had
sheltered
in
the
village
houses

They
all
rushed
out
of
the
village
again

but
T

shin


s
guns
could
not
move

and
the
artillerymen

T

shin

and
the
cadet
exchanged
silent
glances
as
they
awaited
their
fate

The
firing
died
down
and
soldiers

talking
eagerly

streamed
out
of
a
side
street





Not
hurt

Petr

v




asked
one





We


ve
given
it



em
hot

mate

They
won


t
make
another
push
now




said
another





You
couldn


t
see
a
thing

How
they
shot
at
their
own
fellows

Nothing
could
be
seen

Pitch
dark

brother

Isn


t
there
something
to
drink





The
French
had
been
repulsed
for
the
last
time

And
again
and
again
in
the
complete
darkness
T

shin


s
guns
moved
forward

surrounded
by
the
humming
infantry
as
by
a
frame


In
the
darkness

it
seemed
as
though
a
gloomy
unseen
river
was
flowing
always
in
one
direction

humming
with
whispers
and
talk
and
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels

Amid
the
general
rumble

the
groans
and
voices
of
the
wounded
were
more
distinctly
heard
than
any
other
sound
in
the
darkness
of
the
night

The
gloom
that
enveloped
the
army
was
filled
with
their
groans

which
seemed
to
melt
into
one
with
the
darkness
of
the
night

After
a
while
the
moving
mass
became
agitated

someone
rode
past
on
a
white
horse
followed
by
his
suite

and
said
something
in
passing




What
did
he
say

Where
to

now

Halt

is
it

Did
he
thank
us




came
eager
questions
from
all
sides

The
whole
moving
mass
began
pressing
closer
together
and
a
report
spread
that
they
were
ordered
to
halt

evidently
those
in
front
had
halted

All
remained
where
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
muddy
road


Fires
were
lighted
and
the
talk
became
more
audible

Captain
T

shin

having
given
orders
to
his
company

sent
a
soldier
to
find
a
dressing
station
or
a
doctor
for
the
cadet

and
sat
down
by
a
bonfire
the
soldiers
had
kindled
on
the
road

Rost

v

too

dragged
himself
to
the
fire

From
pain

cold

and
damp

a
feverish
shivering
shook
his
whole
body

Drowsiness
was
irresistibly
mastering
him

but
he
kept
awake
by
an
excruciating
pain
in
his
arm

for
which
he
could
find
no
satisfactory
position

He
kept
closing
his
eyes
and
then
again
looking
at
the
fire

which
seemed
to
him
dazzlingly
red

and
at
the
feeble

round
shouldered
figure
of
T

shin
who
was
sitting
cross
legged
like
a
Turk
beside
him

T

shin


s
large

kind

intelligent
eyes
were
fixed
with
sympathy
and
commiseration
on
Rost

v

who
saw
that
T

shin
with
his
whole
heart
wished
to
help
him
but
could
not


From
all
sides
were
heard
the
footsteps
and
talk
of
the
infantry

who
were
walking

driving
past

and
settling
down
all
around

The
sound
of
voices

the
tramping
feet

the
horses



hoofs
moving
in
mud

the
crackling
of
wood
fires
near
and
afar

merged
into
one
tremulous
rumble


It
was
no
longer

as
before

a
dark

unseen
river
flowing
through
the
gloom

but
a
dark
sea
swelling
and
gradually
subsiding
after
a
storm

Rost

v
looked
at
and
listened
listlessly
to
what
passed
before
and
around
him

An
infantryman
came
to
the
fire

squatted
on
his
heels

held
his
hands
to
the
blaze

and
turned
away
his
face





You
don


t
mind
your
honor




he
asked
T

shin




I


ve
lost
my
company

your
honor

I
don


t
know
where



such
bad
luck





With
the
soldier

an
infantry
officer
with
a
bandaged
cheek
came
up
to
the
bonfire

and
addressing
T

shin
asked
him
to
have
the
guns
moved
a
trifle
to
let
a
wagon
go
past

After
he
had
gone

two
soldiers
rushed
to
the
campfire

They
were
quarreling
and
fighting
desperately

each
trying
to
snatch
from
the
other
a
boot
they
were
both
holding
on
to





You
picked
it
up




I
dare
say

You


re
very
smart




one
of
them
shouted
hoarsely


Then
a
thin

pale
soldier

his
neck
bandaged
with
a
bloodstained
leg
band

came
up
and
in
angry
tones
asked
the
artillerymen
for
water





Must
one
die
like
a
dog




said
he


T

shin
told
them
to
give
the
man
some
water

Then
a
cheerful
soldier
ran
up

begging
a
little
fire
for
the
infantry





A
nice
little
hot
torch
for
the
infantry

Good
luck
to
you

fellow
countrymen

Thanks
for
the
fire


we


ll
return
it
with
interest




said
he

carrying
away
into
the
darkness
a
glowing
stick


Next
came
four
soldiers

carrying
something
heavy
on
a
cloak

and
passed
by
the
fire

One
of
them
stumbled





Who
the
devil
has
put
the
logs
on
the
road




snarled
he





He


s
dead


why
carry
him




said
another





Shut
up





And
they
disappeared
into
the
darkness
with
their
load





Still
aching




T

shin
asked
Rost

v
in
a
whisper





Yes








Your
honor

you


re
wanted
by
the
general

He
is
in
the
hut
here




said
a
gunner

coming
up
to
T

shin





Coming

friend





T

shin
rose
and

buttoning
his
greatcoat
and
pulling
it
straight

walked
away
from
the
fire


Not
far
from
the
artillery
campfire

in
a
hut
that
had
been
prepared
for
him

Prince
Bagrati

n
sat
at
dinner

talking
with
some
commanding
officers
who
had
gathered
at
his
quarters

The
little
old
man
with
the
half
closed
eyes
was
there
greedily
gnawing
a
mutton
bone

and
the
general
who
had
served
blamelessly
for
twenty
two
years

flushed
by
a
glass
of
vodka
and
the
dinner

and
the
staff
officer
with
the
signet
ring

and
Zherk

v

uneasily
glancing
at
them
all

and
Prince
Andrew

pale

with
compressed
lips
and
feverishly
glittering
eyes


In
a
corner
of
the
hut
stood
a
standard
captured
from
the
French

and
the
accountant
with
the
na

ve
face
was
feeling
its
texture

shaking
his
head
in
perplexity


perhaps
because
the
banner
really
interested
him

perhaps
because
it
was
hard
for
him

hungry
as
he
was

to
look
on
at
a
dinner
where
there
was
no
place
for
him

In
the
next
hut
there
was
a
French
colonel
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
our
dragoons

Our
officers
were
flocking
in
to
look
at
him

Prince
Bagrati

n
was
thanking
the
individual
commanders
and
inquiring
into
details
of
the
action
and
our
losses

The
general
whose
regiment
had
been
inspected
at
Braunau
was
informing
the
prince
that
as
soon
as
the
action
began
he
had
withdrawn
from
the
wood

mustered
the
men
who
were
woodcutting

and

allowing
the
French
to
pass
him

had
made
a
bayonet
charge
with
two
battalions
and
had
broken
up
the
French
troops





When
I
saw

your
excellency

that
their
first
battalion
was
disorganized

I
stopped
in
the
road
and
thought




I


ll
let
them
come
on
and
will
meet
them
with
the
fire
of
the
whole
battalion





and
that


s
what
I
did





The
general
had
so
wished
to
do
this
and
was
so
sorry
he
had
not
managed
to
do
it
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
had
really
happened

Perhaps
it
might
really
have
been
so

Could
one
possibly
make
out
amid
all
that
confusion
what
did
or
did
not
happen





By
the
way

your
excellency

I
should
inform
you




he
continued


remembering
D

lokhov


s
conversation
with
Kut

zov
and
his
last
interview
with
the
gentleman
ranker





that
Private
D

lokhov

who
was
reduced
to
the
ranks

took
a
French
officer
prisoner
in
my
presence
and
particularly
distinguished
himself








I
saw
the
P

vlograd
hussars
attack
there

your
excellency




chimed
in
Zherk

v

looking
uneasily
around

He
had
not
seen
the
hussars
all
that
day

but
had
heard
about
them
from
an
infantry
officer




They
broke
up
two
squares

your
excellency





Several
of
those
present
smiled
at
Zherk

v


s
words

expecting
one
of
his
usual
jokes

but
noticing
that
what
he
was
saying
redounded
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
of
the
day


s
work

they
assumed
a
serious
expression

though
many
of
them
knew
that
what
he
was
saying
was
a
lie
devoid
of
any
foundation

Prince
Bagrati

n
turned
to
the
old
colonel





Gentlemen

I
thank
you
all

all
arms
have
behaved
heroically

infantry

cavalry

and
artillery

How
was
it
that
two
guns
were
abandoned
in
the
center




he
inquired

searching
with
his
eyes
for
someone


Prince
Bagrati

n
did
not
ask
about
the
guns
on
the
left
flank

he
knew
that
all
the
guns
there
had
been
abandoned
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
action





I
think
I
sent
you




he
added

turning
to
the
staff
officer
on
duty





One
was
damaged




answered
the
staff
officer




and
the
other
I
can


t
understand

I
was
there
all
the
time
giving
orders
and
had
only
just
left




It
is
true
that
it
was
hot
there




he
added

modestly


Someone
mentioned
that
Captain
T

shin
was
bivouacking
close
to
the
village
and
had
already
been
sent
for





Oh

but
you
were
there




said
Prince
Bagrati

n

addressing
Prince
Andrew





Of
course

we
only
just
missed
one
another




said
the
staff
officer

with
a
smile
to
Bolk

nski





I
had
not
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you




said
Prince
Andrew

coldly
and
abruptly


All
were
silent

T

shin
appeared
at
the
threshold
and
made
his
way
timidly
from
behind
the
backs
of
the
generals

As
he
stepped
past
the
generals
in
the
crowded
hut

feeling
embarrassed
as
he
always
was
by
the
sight
of
his
superiors

he
did
not
notice
the
staff
of
the
banner
and
stumbled
over
it

Several
of
those
present
laughed





How
was
it
a
gun
was
abandoned




asked
Bagrati

n

frowning

not
so
much
at
the
captain
as
at
those
who
were
laughing

among
whom
Zherk

v
laughed
loudest


Only
now

when
he
was
confronted
by
the
stern
authorities

did
his
guilt
and
the
disgrace
of
having
lost
two
guns
and
yet
remaining
alive
present
themselves
to
T

shin
in
all
their
horror

He
had
been
so
excited
that
he
had
not
thought
about
it
until
that
moment

The
officers



laughter
confused
him
still
more

He
stood
before
Bagrati

n
with
his
lower
jaw
trembling
and
was
hardly
able
to
mutter




I
don


t
know



your
excellency



I
had
no
men



your
excellency








You
might
have
taken
some
from
the
covering
troops





T

shin
did
not
say
that
there
were
no
covering
troops

though
that
was
perfectly
true

He
was
afraid
of
getting
some
other
officer
into
trouble

and
silently
fixed
his
eyes
on
Bagrati

n
as
a
schoolboy
who
has
blundered
looks
at
an
examiner


The
silence
lasted
some
time

Prince
Bagrati

n

apparently
not
wishing
to
be
severe

found
nothing
to
say

the
others
did
not
venture
to
intervene

Prince
Andrew
looked
at
T

shin
from
under
his
brows
and
his
fingers
twitched
nervously





Your
excellency




Prince
Andrew
broke
the
silence
with
his
abrupt
voice




you
were
pleased
to
send
me
to
Captain
T

shin


s
battery

I
went
there
and
found
two
thirds
of
the
men
and
horses
knocked
out

two
guns
smashed

and
no
supports
at
all





Prince
Bagrati

n
and
T

shin
looked
with
equal
intentness
at
Bolk

nski

who
spoke
with
suppressed
agitation





And

if
your
excellency
will
allow
me
to
express
my
opinion




he
continued




we
owe
today


s
success
chiefly
to
the
action
of
that
battery
and
the
heroic
endurance
of
Captain
T

shin
and
his
company




and
without
awaiting
a
reply

Prince
Andrew
rose
and
left
the
table


Prince
Bagrati

n
looked
at
T

shin

evidently
reluctant
to
show
distrust
in
Bolk

nski


s
emphatic
opinion
yet
not
feeling
able
fully
to
credit
it

bent
his
head

and
told
T

shin
that
he
could
go

Prince
Andrew
went
out
with
him





Thank
you

you
saved
me

my
dear
fellow




said
T

shin


Prince
Andrew
gave
him
a
look

but
said
nothing
and
went
away

He
felt
sad
and
depressed

It
was
all
so
strange

so
unlike
what
he
had
hoped






Who
are
they

Why
are
they
here

What
do
they
want

And
when
will
all
this
end




thought
Rost

v

looking
at
the
changing
shadows
before
him

The
pain
in
his
arm
became
more
and
more
intense

Irresistible
drowsiness
overpowered
him

red
rings
danced
before
his
eyes

and
the
impression
of
those
voices
and
faces
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
merged
with
the
physical
pain

It
was
they

these
soldiers


wounded
and
unwounded


it
was
they
who
were
crushing

weighing
down

and
twisting
the
sinews
and
scorching
the
flesh
of
his
sprained
arm
and
shoulder

To
rid
himself
of
them
he
closed
his
eyes


For
a
moment
he
dozed

but
in
that
short
interval
innumerable
things
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream

his
mother
and
her
large
white
hand

S

nya


s
thin
little
shoulders

Nat

sha


s
eyes
and
laughter

Den

sov
with
his
voice
and
mustache

and
Tely

nin
and
all
that
affair
with
Tely

nin
and
Bogd

nich

That
affair
was
the
same
thing
as
this
soldier
with
the
harsh
voice

and
it
was
that
affair
and
this
soldier
that
were
so
agonizingly

incessantly
pulling
and
pressing
his
arm
and
always
dragging
it
in
one
direction

He
tried
to
get
away
from
them

but
they
would
not
for
an
instant
let
his
shoulder
move
a
hair


s
breadth

It
would
not
ache


it
would
be
well


if
only
they
did
not
pull
it

but
it
was
impossible
to
get
rid
of
them


He
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up

The
black
canopy
of
night
hung
less
than
a
yard
above
the
glow
of
the
charcoal

Flakes
of
falling
snow
were
fluttering
in
that
light

T

shin
had
not
returned

the
doctor
had
not
come

He
was
alone
now

except
for
a
soldier
who
was
sitting
naked
at
the
other
side
of
the
fire

warming
his
thin
yellow
body





Nobody
wants
me




thought
Rost

v




There
is
no
one
to
help
me
or
pity
me

Yet
I
was
once
at
home

strong

happy

and
loved




He
sighed
and

doing
so

groaned
involuntarily





Eh

is
anything
hurting
you




asked
the
soldier

shaking
his
shirt
out
over
the
fire

and
not
waiting
for
an
answer
he
gave
a
grunt
and
added




What
a
lot
of
men
have
been
crippled
today


frightful





Rost

v
did
not
listen
to
the
soldier

He
looked
at
the
snowflakes
fluttering
above
the
fire
and
remembered
a
Russian
winter
at
his
warm

bright
home

his
fluffy
fur
coat

his
quickly
gliding
sleigh

his
healthy
body

and
all
the
affection
and
care
of
his
family




And
why
did
I
come
here




he
wondered


Next
day
the
French
army
did
not
renew
their
attack

and
the
remnant
of
Bagrati

n


s
detachment
was
reunited
to
Kut

zov


s
army






BOOK
THREE











CHAPTER
I

Prince
Vas

li
was
not
a
man
who
deliberately
thought
out
his
plans

Still
less
did
he
think
of
injuring
anyone
for
his
own
advantage

He
was
merely
a
man
of
the
world
who
had
got
on
and
to
whom
getting
on
had
become
a
habit

Schemes
and
devices
for
which
he
never
rightly
accounted
to
himself

but
which
formed
the
whole
interest
of
his
life

were
constantly
shaping
themselves
in
his
mind

arising
from
the
circumstances
and
persons
he
met

Of
these
plans
he
had
not
merely
one
or
two
in
his
head
but
dozens

some
only
beginning
to
form
themselves

some
approaching
achievement

and
some
in
course
of
disintegration

He
did
not

for
instance

say
to
himself




This
man
now
has
influence

I
must
gain
his
confidence
and
friendship
and
through
him
obtain
a
special
grant




Nor
did
he
say
to
himself




Pierre
is
a
rich
man

I
must
entice
him
to
marry
my
daughter
and
lend
me
the
forty
thousand
rubles
I
need




But
when
he
came
across
a
man
of
position
his
instinct
immediately
told
him
that
this
man
could
be
useful

and
without
any
premeditation
Prince
Vas

li
took
the
first
opportunity
to
gain
his
confidence

flatter
him

become
intimate
with
him

and
finally
make
his
request


He
had
Pierre
at
hand
in
Moscow
and
procured
for
him
an
appointment
as
Gentleman
of
the
Bedchamber

which
at
that
time
conferred
the
status
of
Councilor
of
State

and
insisted
on
the
young
man
accompanying
him
to
Petersburg
and
staying
at
his
house

With
apparent
absent
mindedness

yet
with
unhesitating
assurance
that
he
was
doing
the
right
thing

Prince
Vas

li
did
everything
to
get
Pierre
to
marry
his
daughter

Had
he
thought
out
his
plans
beforehand
he
could
not
have
been
so
natural
and
shown
such
unaffected
familiarity
in
intercourse
with
everybody
both
above
and
below
him
in
social
standing

Something
always
drew
him
toward
those
richer
and
more
powerful
than
himself
and
he
had
rare
skill
in
seizing
the
most
opportune
moment
for
making
use
of
people


Pierre

on
unexpectedly
becoming
Count
Bez

khov
and
a
rich
man

felt
himself
after
his
recent
loneliness
and
freedom
from
cares
so
beset
and
preoccupied
that
only
in
bed
was
he
able
to
be
by
himself

He
had
to
sign
papers

to
present
himself
at
government
offices

the
purpose
of
which
was
not
clear
to
him

to
question
his
chief
steward

to
visit
his
estate
near
Moscow

and
to
receive
many
people
who
formerly
did
not
even
wish
to
know
of
his
existence
but
would
now
have
been
offended
and
grieved
had
he
chosen
not
to
see
them

These
different
people


businessmen

relations

and
acquaintances
alike


were
all
disposed
to
treat
the
young
heir
in
the
most
friendly
and
flattering
manner

they
were
all
evidently
firmly
convinced
of
Pierre


s
noble
qualities

He
was
always
hearing
such
words
as




With
your
remarkable
kindness




or




With
your
excellent
heart







You
are
yourself
so
honorable

Count




or




Were
he
as
clever
as
you




and
so
on

till
he
began
sincerely
to
believe
in
his
own
exceptional
kindness
and
extraordinary
intelligence

the
more
so
as
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
it
had
always
seemed
to
him
that
he
really
was
very
kind
and
intelligent

Even
people
who
had
formerly
been
spiteful
toward
him
and
evidently
unfriendly
now
became
gentle
and
affectionate

The
angry
eldest
princess

with
the
long
waist
and
hair
plastered
down
like
a
doll


s

had
come
into
Pierre


s
room
after
the
funeral

With
drooping
eyes
and
frequent
blushes
she
told
him
she
was
very
sorry
about
their
past
misunderstandings
and
did
not
now
feel
she
had
a
right
to
ask
him
for
anything

except
only
for
permission

after
the
blow
she
had
received

to
remain
for
a
few
weeks
longer
in
the
house
she
so
loved
and
where
she
had
sacrificed
so
much

She
could
not
refrain
from
weeping
at
these
words

Touched
that
this
statuesque
princess
could
so
change

Pierre
took
her
hand
and
begged
her
forgiveness

without
knowing
what
for

From
that
day
the
eldest
princess
quite
changed
toward
Pierre
and
began
knitting
a
striped
scarf
for
him





Do
this
for
my
sake

mon
cher

after
all

she
had
to
put
up
with
a
great
deal
from
the
deceased




said
Prince
Vas

li
to
him

handing
him
a
deed
to
sign
for
the
princess



benefit


Prince
Vas

li
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
necessary
to
throw
this
bone


a
bill
for
thirty
thousand
rubles


to
the
poor
princess
that
it
might
not
occur
to
her
to
speak
of
his
share
in
the
affair
of
the
inlaid
portfolio

Pierre
signed
the
deed
and
after
that
the
princess
grew
still
kinder

The
younger
sisters
also
became
affectionate
to
him

especially
the
youngest

the
pretty
one
with
the
mole

who
often
made
him
feel
confused
by
her
smiles
and
her
own
confusion
when
meeting
him


It
seemed
so
natural
to
Pierre
that
everyone
should
like
him

and
it
would
have
seemed
so
unnatural
had
anyone
disliked
him

that
he
could
not
but
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
those
around
him

Besides

he
had
no
time
to
ask
himself
whether
these
people
were
sincere
or
not

He
was
always
busy
and
always
felt
in
a
state
of
mild
and
cheerful
intoxication

He
felt
as
though
he
were
the
center
of
some
important
and
general
movement

that
something
was
constantly
expected
of
him

that
if
he
did
not
do
it
he
would
grieve
and
disappoint
many
people

but
if
he
did
this
and
that

all
would
be
well

and
he
did
what
was
demanded
of
him

but
still
that
happy
result
always
remained
in
the
future


More
than
anyone
else

Prince
Vas

li
took
possession
of
Pierre


s
affairs
and
of
Pierre
himself
in
those
early
days

From
the
death
of
Count
Bez

khov
he
did
not
let
go
his
hold
of
the
lad

He
had
the
air
of
a
man
oppressed
by
business

weary
and
suffering

who
yet
would
not

for
pity


s
sake

leave
this
helpless
youth
who

after
all

was
the
son
of
his
old
friend
and
the
possessor
of
such
enormous
wealth

to
the
caprice
of
fate
and
the
designs
of
rogues

During
the
few
days
he
spent
in
Moscow
after
the
death
of
Count
Bez

khov

he
would
call
Pierre

or
go
to
him
himself

and
tell
him
what
ought
to
be
done
in
a
tone
of
weariness
and
assurance

as
if
he
were
adding
every
time




You
know
I
am
overwhelmed
with
business
and
it
is
purely
out
of
charity
that
I
trouble
myself
about
you

and
you
also
know
quite
well
that
what
I
propose
is
the
only
thing
possible








Well

my
dear
fellow

tomorrow
we
are
off
at
last




said
Prince
Vas

li
one
day

closing
his
eyes
and
fingering
Pierre


s
elbow

speaking
as
if
he
were
saying
something
which
had
long
since
been
agreed
upon
and
could
not
now
be
altered




We
start
tomorrow
and
I


m
giving
you
a
place
in
my
carriage

I
am
very
glad

All
our
important
business
here
is
now
settled

and
I
ought
to
have
been
off
long
ago

Here
is
something
I
have
received
from
the
chancellor

I
asked
him
for
you

and
you
have
been
entered
in
the
diplomatic
corps
and
made
a
Gentleman
of
the
Bedchamber

The
diplomatic
career
now
lies
open
before
you





Notwithstanding
the
tone
of
wearied
assurance
with
which
these
words
were
pronounced

Pierre

who
had
so
long
been
considering
his
career

wished
to
make
some
suggestion

But
Prince
Vas

li
interrupted
him
in
the
special
deep
cooing
tone

precluding
the
possibility
of
interrupting
his
speech

which
he
used
in
extreme
cases
when
special
persuasion
was
needed





Mais

mon
cher

I
did
this
for
my
own
sake

to
satisfy
my
conscience

and
there
is
nothing
to
thank
me
for

No
one
has
ever
complained
yet
of
being
too
much
loved

and
besides

you
are
free

you
could
throw
it
up
tomorrow

But
you
will
see
everything
for
yourself
when
you
get
to
Petersburg

It
is
high
time
for
you
to
get
away
from
these
terrible
recollections




Prince
Vas

li
sighed




Yes

yes

my
boy

And
my
valet
can
go
in
your
carriage

Ah

I
was
nearly
forgetting




he
added




You
know

mon
cher

your
father
and
I
had
some
accounts
to
settle

so
I
have
received
what
was
due
from
the
Ryaz

n
estate
and
will
keep
it

you
won


t
require
it

We


ll
go
into
the
accounts
later





By



what
was
due
from
the
Ryaz

n
estate



Prince
Vas

li
meant
several
thousand
rubles
quitrent
received
from
Pierre


s
peasants

which
the
prince
had
retained
for
himself


In
Petersburg

as
in
Moscow

Pierre
found
the
same
atmosphere
of
gentleness
and
affection

He
could
not
refuse
the
post

or
rather
the
rank

for
he
did
nothing


that
Prince
Vas

li
had
procured
for
him

and
acquaintances

invitations

and
social
occupations
were
so
numerous
that

even
more
than
in
Moscow

he
felt
a
sense
of
bewilderment

bustle

and
continual
expectation
of
some
good

always
in
front
of
him
but
never
attained


Of
his
former
bachelor
acquaintances
many
were
no
longer
in
Petersburg

The
Guards
had
gone
to
the
front

D

lokhov
had
been
reduced
to
the
ranks

Anatole
was
in
the
army
somewhere
in
the
provinces

Prince
Andrew
was
abroad

so
Pierre
had
not
the
opportunity
to
spend
his
nights
as
he
used
to
like
to
spend
them

or
to
open
his
mind
by
intimate
talks
with
a
friend
older
than
himself
and
whom
he
respected

His
whole
time
was
taken
up
with
dinners
and
balls
and
was
spent
chiefly
at
Prince
Vas

li


s
house
in
the
company
of
the
stout
princess

his
wife

and
his
beautiful
daughter
H

l

ne


Like
the
others

Anna
P

vlovna
Sch

rer
showed
Pierre
the
change
of
attitude
toward
him
that
had
taken
place
in
society


Formerly
in
Anna
P

vlovna


s
presence

Pierre
had
always
felt
that
what
he
was
saying
was
out
of
place

tactless
and
unsuitable

that
remarks
which
seemed
to
him
clever
while
they
formed
in
his
mind
became
foolish
as
soon
as
he
uttered
them

while
on
the
contrary
Hippolyte


s
stupidest
remarks
came
out
clever
and
apt

Now
everything
Pierre
said
was
charmant

Even
if
Anna
P

vlovna
did
not
say
so

he
could
see
that
she
wished
to
and
only
refrained
out
of
regard
for
his
modesty


In
the
beginning
of
the
winter
of







Pierre
received
one
of
Anna
P

vlovna


s
usual
pink
notes
with
an
invitation
to
which
was
added




You
will
find
the
beautiful
H

l

ne
here

whom
it
is
always
delightful
to
see





When
he
read
that
sentence

Pierre
felt
for
the
first
time
that
some
link
which
other
people
recognized
had
grown
up
between
himself
and
H

l

ne

and
that
thought
both
alarmed
him

as
if
some
obligation
were
being
imposed
on
him
which
he
could
not
fulfill

and
pleased
him
as
an
entertaining
supposition


Anna
P

vlovna


s



At
Home



was
like
the
former
one

only
the
novelty
she
offered
her
guests
this
time
was
not
Mortemart

but
a
diplomatist
fresh
from
Berlin
with
the
very
latest
details
of
the
Emperor
Alexander


s
visit
to
Potsdam

and
of
how
the
two
august
friends
had
pledged
themselves
in
an
indissoluble
alliance
to
uphold
the
cause
of
justice
against
the
enemy
of
the
human
race

Anna
P

vlovna
received
Pierre
with
a
shade
of
melancholy

evidently
relating
to
the
young
man


s
recent
loss
by
the
death
of
Count
Bez

khov

everyone
constantly
considered
it
a
duty
to
assure
Pierre
that
he
was
greatly
afflicted
by
the
death
of
the
father
he
had
hardly
known


and
her
melancholy
was
just
like
the
august
melancholy
she
showed
at
the
mention
of
her
most
august
Majesty
the
Empress
M

rya
F

dorovna

Pierre
felt
flattered
by
this

Anna
P

vlovna
arranged
the
different
groups
in
her
drawing
room
with
her
habitual
skill

The
large
group

in
which
were
Prince
Vas

li
and
the
generals

had
the
benefit
of
the
diplomat

Another
group
was
at
the
tea
table

Pierre
wished
to
join
the
former

but
Anna
P

vlovna


who
was
in
the
excited
condition
of
a
commander
on
a
battlefield
to
whom
thousands
of
new
and
brilliant
ideas
occur
which
there
is
hardly
time
to
put
in
action


seeing
Pierre

touched
his
sleeve
with
her
finger

saying





Wait
a
bit

I
have
something
in
view
for
you
this
evening





She
glanced
at
H

l

ne
and
smiled
at
her





My
dear
H

l

ne

be
charitable
to
my
poor
aunt
who
adores
you

Go
and
keep
her
company
for
ten
minutes

And
that
it
will
not
be
too
dull

here
is
the
dear
count
who
will
not
refuse
to
accompany
you





The
beauty
went
to
the
aunt

but
Anna
P

vlovna
detained
Pierre

looking
as
if
she
had
to
give
some
final
necessary
instructions





Isn


t
she
exquisite




she
said
to
Pierre

pointing
to
the
stately
beauty
as
she
glided
away




And
how
she
carries
herself

For
so
young
a
girl

such
tact

such
masterly
perfection
of
manner

It
comes
from
her
heart

Happy
the
man
who
wins
her

With
her
the
least
worldly
of
men
would
occupy
a
most
brilliant
position
in
society

Don


t
you
think
so

I
only
wanted
to
know
your
opinion




and
Anna
P

vlovna
let
Pierre
go


Pierre

in
reply

sincerely
agreed
with
her
as
to
H

l

ne


s
perfection
of
manner

If
he
ever
thought
of
H

l

ne

it
was
just
of
her
beauty
and
her
remarkable
skill
in
appearing
silently
dignified
in
society


The
old
aunt
received
the
two
young
people
in
her
corner

but
seemed
desirous
of
hiding
her
adoration
for
H

l

ne
and
inclined
rather
to
show
her
fear
of
Anna
P

vlovna

She
looked
at
her
niece

as
if
inquiring
what
she
was
to
do
with
these
people

On
leaving
them

Anna
P

vlovna
again
touched
Pierre


s
sleeve

saying




I
hope
you
won


t
say
that
it
is
dull
in
my
house
again




and
she
glanced
at
H

l

ne


H

l

ne
smiled

with
a
look
implying
that
she
did
not
admit
the
possibility
of
anyone
seeing
her
without
being
enchanted

The
aunt
coughed

swallowed

and
said
in
French
that
she
was
very
pleased
to
see
H

l

ne

then
she
turned
to
Pierre
with
the
same
words
of
welcome
and
the
same
look

In
the
middle
of
a
dull
and
halting
conversation

H

l

ne
turned
to
Pierre
with
the
beautiful
bright
smile
that
she
gave
to
everyone

Pierre
was
so
used
to
that
smile

and
it
had
so
little
meaning
for
him

that
he
paid
no
attention
to
it

The
aunt
was
just
speaking
of
a
collection
of
snuffboxes
that
had
belonged
to
Pierre


s
father

Count
Bez

khov

and
showed
them
her
own
box

Princess
H

l

ne
asked
to
see
the
portrait
of
the
aunt


s
husband
on
the
box
lid





That
is
probably
the
work
of
Vinesse




said
Pierre

mentioning
a
celebrated
miniaturist

and
he
leaned
over
the
table
to
take
the
snuffbox
while
trying
to
hear
what
was
being
said
at
the
other
table


He
half
rose

meaning
to
go
round

but
the
aunt
handed
him
the
snuffbox

passing
it
across
H

l

ne


s
back

H

l

ne
stooped
forward
to
make
room

and
looked
round
with
a
smile

She
was

as
always
at
evening
parties

wearing
a
dress
such
as
was
then
fashionable

cut
very
low
at
front
and
back

Her
bust

which
had
always
seemed
like
marble
to
Pierre

was
so
close
to
him
that
his
shortsighted
eyes
could
not
but
perceive
the
living
charm
of
her
neck
and
shoulders

so
near
to
his
lips
that
he
need
only
have
bent
his
head
a
little
to
have
touched
them

He
was
conscious
of
the
warmth
of
her
body

the
scent
of
perfume

and
the
creaking
of
her
corset
as
she
moved

He
did
not
see
her
marble
beauty
forming
a
complete
whole
with
her
dress

but
all
the
charm
of
her
body
only
covered
by
her
garments

And
having
once
seen
this
he
could
not
help
being
aware
of
it

just
as
we
cannot
renew
an
illusion
we
have
once
seen
through





So
you
have
never
noticed
before
how
beautiful
I
am




H

l

ne
seemed
to
say




You
had
not
noticed
that
I
am
a
woman

Yes

I
am
a
woman
who
may
belong
to
anyone


to
you
too




said
her
glance

And
at
that
moment
Pierre
felt
that
H

l

ne
not
only
could

but
must

be
his
wife

and
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise


He
knew
this
at
that
moment
as
surely
as
if
he
had
been
standing
at
the
altar
with
her

How
and
when
this
would
be
he
did
not
know

he
did
not
even
know
if
it
would
be
a
good
thing

he
even
felt

he
knew
not
why

that
it
would
be
a
bad
thing


but
he
knew
it
would
happen


Pierre
dropped
his
eyes

lifted
them
again

and
wished
once
more
to
see
her
as
a
distant
beauty
far
removed
from
him

as
he
had
seen
her
every
day
until
then

but
he
could
no
longer
do
it

He
could
not

any
more
than
a
man
who
has
been
looking
at
a
tuft
of
steppe
grass
through
the
mist
and
taking
it
for
a
tree
can
again
take
it
for
a
tree
after
he
has
once
recognized
it
to
be
a
tuft
of
grass

She
was
terribly
close
to
him

She
already
had
power
over
him

and
between
them
there
was
no
longer
any
barrier
except
the
barrier
of
his
own
will





Well

I
will
leave
you
in
your
little
corner




came
Anna
P

vlovna


s
voice




I
see
you
are
all
right
there





And
Pierre

anxiously
trying
to
remember
whether
he
had
done
anything
reprehensible

looked
round
with
a
blush

It
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
as
he
knew
it
himself


A
little
later
when
he
went
up
to
the
large
circle

Anna
P

vlovna
said
to
him




I
hear
you
are
refitting
your
Petersburg
house





This
was
true

The
architect
had
told
him
that
it
was
necessary

and
Pierre

without
knowing
why

was
having
his
enormous
Petersburg
house
done
up





That


s
a
good
thing

but
don


t
move
from
Prince
Vas

li


s

It
is
good
to
have
a
friend
like
the
prince




she
said

smiling
at
Prince
Vas

li




I
know
something
about
that

Don


t
I

And
you
are
still
so
young

You
need
advice

Don


t
be
angry
with
me
for
exercising
an
old
woman


s
privilege





She
paused

as
women
always
do

expecting
something
after
they
have
mentioned
their
age




If
you
marry
it
will
be
a
different
thing




she
continued

uniting
them
both
in
one
glance

Pierre
did
not
look
at
H

l

ne
nor
she
at
him

But
she
was
just
as
terribly
close
to
him

He
muttered
something
and
colored


When
he
got
home
he
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
for
thinking
of
what
had
happened

What
had
happened

Nothing

He
had
merely
understood
that
the
woman
he
had
known
as
a
child

of
whom
when
her
beauty
was
mentioned
he
had
said
absent
mindedly




Yes

she


s
good
looking




he
had
understood
that
this
woman
might
belong
to
him





But
she


s
stupid

I
have
myself
said
she
is
stupid




he
thought




There
is
something
nasty

something
wrong

in
the
feeling
she
excites
in
me

I
have
been
told
that
her
brother
Anatole
was
in
love
with
her
and
she
with
him

that
there
was
quite
a
scandal
and
that
that


s
why
he
was
sent
away

Hippolyte
is
her
brother



Prince
Vas

li
is
her
father



It


s
bad







he
reflected

but
while
he
was
thinking
this

the
reflection
was
still
incomplete


he
caught
himself
smiling
and
was
conscious
that
another
line
of
thought
had
sprung
up

and
while
thinking
of
her
worthlessness
he
was
also
dreaming
of
how
she
would
be
his
wife

how
she
would
love
him
become
quite
different

and
how
all
he
had
thought
and
heard
of
her
might
be
false

And
he
again
saw
her
not
as
the
daughter
of
Prince
Vas

li

but
visualized
her
whole
body
only
veiled
by
its
gray
dress




But
no

Why
did
this
thought
never
occur
to
me
before




and
again
he
told
himself
that
it
was
impossible

that
there
would
be
something
unnatural

and
as
it
seemed
to
him
dishonorable

in
this
marriage

He
recalled
her
former
words
and
looks
and
the
words
and
looks
of
those
who
had
seen
them
together

He
recalled
Anna
P

vlovna


s
words
and
looks
when
she
spoke
to
him
about
his
house

recalled
thousands
of
such
hints
from
Prince
Vas

li
and
others

and
was
seized
by
terror
lest
he
had
already

in
some
way

bound
himself
to
do
something
that
was
evidently
wrong
and
that
he
ought
not
to
do

But
at
the
very
time
he
was
expressing
this
conviction
to
himself

in
another
part
of
his
mind
her
image
rose
in
all
its
womanly
beauty






CHAPTER
II

In
November







Prince
Vas

li
had
to
go
on
a
tour
of
inspection
in
four
different
provinces

He
had
arranged
this
for
himself
so
as
to
visit
his
neglected
estates
at
the
same
time
and
pick
up
his
son
Anatole
where
his
regiment
was
stationed

and
take
him
to
visit
Prince
Nicholas
Bolk

nski
in
order
to
arrange
a
match
for
him
with
the
daughter
of
that
rich
old
man

But
before
leaving
home
and
undertaking
these
new
affairs

Prince
Vas

li
had
to
settle
matters
with
Pierre

who

it
is
true

had
latterly
spent
whole
days
at
home

that
is

in
Prince
Vas

li


s
house
where
he
was
staying

and
had
been
absurd

excited

and
foolish
in
H

l

ne


s
presence

as
a
lover
should
be


but
had
not
yet
proposed
to
her





This
is
all
very
fine

but
things
must
be
settled




said
Prince
Vas

li
to
himself

with
a
sorrowful
sigh

one
morning

feeling
that
Pierre
who
was
under
such
obligations
to
him




But
never
mind
that




was
not
behaving
very
well
in
this
matter




Youth

frivolity



well

God
be
with
him




thought
he

relishing
his
own
goodness
of
heart




but
it
must
be
brought
to
a
head

The
day
after
tomorrow
will
be
L

lya


s
name
day

I
will
invite
two
or
three
people

and
if
he
does
not
understand
what
he
ought
to
do
then
it
will
be
my
affair


yes

my
affair

I
am
her
father





Six
weeks
after
Anna
P

vlovna


s



At
Home



and
after
the
sleepless
night
when
he
had
decided
that
to
marry
H

l

ne
would
be
a
calamity
and
that
he
ought
to
avoid
her
and
go
away

Pierre

despite
that
decision

had
not
left
Prince
Vas

li


s
and
felt
with
terror
that
in
people


s
eyes
he
was
every
day
more
and
more
connected
with
her

that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
return
to
his
former
conception
of
her

that
he
could
not
break
away
from
her

and
that
though
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
he
would
have
to
unite
his
fate
with
hers

He
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
free
himself
but
that
Prince
Vas

li

who
had
rarely
before
given
receptions

now
hardly
let
a
day
go
by
without
having
an
evening
party
at
which
Pierre
had
to
be
present
unless
he
wished
to
spoil
the
general
pleasure
and
disappoint
everyone


s
expectation

Prince
Vas

li

in
the
rare
moments
when
he
was
at
home

would
take
Pierre


s
hand
in
passing
and
draw
it
downwards

or
absent
mindedly
hold
out
his
wrinkled

clean
shaven
cheek
for
Pierre
to
kiss
and
would
say




Till
tomorrow




or




Be
in
to
dinner
or
I
shall
not
see
you




or




I
am
staying
in
for
your
sake




and
so
on

And
though
Prince
Vas

li

when
he
stayed
in

as
he
said

for
Pierre


s
sake

hardly
exchanged
a
couple
of
words
with
him

Pierre
felt
unable
to
disappoint
him

Every
day
he
said
to
himself
one
and
the
same
thing




It
is
time
I
understood
her
and
made
up
my
mind
what
she
really
is

Was
I
mistaken
before

or
am
I
mistaken
now

No

she
is
not
stupid

she
is
an
excellent
girl




he
sometimes
said
to
himself



she
never
makes
a
mistake

never
says
anything
stupid

She
says
little

but
what
she
does
say
is
always
clear
and
simple

so
she
is
not
stupid

She
never
was
abashed
and
is
not
abashed
now

so
she
cannot
be
a
bad
woman




He
had
often
begun
to
make
reflections
or
think
aloud
in
her
company

and
she
had
always
answered
him
either
by
a
brief
but
appropriate
remark


showing
that
it
did
not
interest
her


or
by
a
silent
look
and
smile
which
more
palpably
than
anything
else
showed
Pierre
her
superiority

She
was
right
in
regarding
all
arguments
as
nonsense
in
comparison
with
that
smile


She
always
addressed
him
with
a
radiantly
confiding
smile
meant
for
him
alone

in
which
there
was
something
more
significant
than
in
the
general
smile
that
usually
brightened
her
face

Pierre
knew
that
everyone
was
waiting
for
him
to
say
a
word
and
cross
a
certain
line

and
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
step
across
it

but
an
incomprehensible
terror
seized
him
at
the
thought
of
that
dreadful
step

A
thousand
times
during
that
month
and
a
half
while
he
felt
himself
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
to
that
dreadful
abyss

Pierre
said
to
himself




What
am
I
doing

I
need
resolution

Can
it
be
that
I
have
none





He
wished
to
take
a
decision

but
felt
with
dismay
that
in
this
matter
he
lacked
that
strength
of
will
which
he
had
known
in
himself
and
really
possessed

Pierre
was
one
of
those
who
are
only
strong
when
they
feel
themselves
quite
innocent

and
since
that
day
when
he
was
overpowered
by
a
feeling
of
desire
while
stooping
over
the
snuffbox
at
Anna
P

vlovna


s

an
unacknowledged
sense
of
the
guilt
of
that
desire
paralyzed
his
will


On
H

l

ne


s
name
day

a
small
party
of
just
their
own
people


as
his
wife
said


met
for
supper
at
Prince
Vas

li


s

All
these
friends
and
relations
had
been
given
to
understand
that
the
fate
of
the
young
girl
would
be
decided
that
evening

The
visitors
were
seated
at
supper

Princess
Kur

gina

a
portly
imposing
woman
who
had
once
been
handsome

was
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
table

On
either
side
of
her
sat
the
more
important
guests


an
old
general
and
his
wife

and
Anna
P

vlovna
Sch

rer

At
the
other
end
sat
the
younger
and
less
important
guests

and
there
too
sat
the
members
of
the
family

and
Pierre
and
H

l

ne

side
by
side

Prince
Vas

li
was
not
having
any
supper

he
went
round
the
table
in
a
merry
mood

sitting
down
now
by
one

now
by
another

of
the
guests

To
each
of
them
he
made
some
careless
and
agreeable
remark
except
to
Pierre
and
H

l

ne

whose
presence
he
seemed
not
to
notice

He
enlivened
the
whole
party

The
wax
candles
burned
brightly

the
silver
and
crystal
gleamed

so
did
the
ladies



toilets
and
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
men


s
epaulets

servants
in
scarlet
liveries
moved
round
the
table

the
clatter
of
plates

knives

and
glasses
mingled
with
the
animated
hum
of
several
conversations

At
one
end
of
the
table

the
old
chamberlain
was
heard
assuring
an
old
baroness
that
he
loved
her
passionately

at
which
she
laughed

at
the
other
could
be
heard
the
story
of
the
misfortunes
of
some
Mary
V

ktorovna
or
other

At
the
center
of
the
table

Prince
Vas

li
attracted
everybody


s
attention

With
a
facetious
smile
on
his
face

he
was
telling
the
ladies
about
last
Wednesday


s
meeting
of
the
Imperial
Council

at
which
Serg

y
Kuzm

ch
Vyazm

tinov

the
new
military
governor
general
of
Petersburg

had
received
and
read
the
then
famous
rescript
of
the
Emperor
Alexander
from
the
army
to
Serg

y
Kuzm

ch

in
which
the
Emperor
said
that
he
was
receiving
from
all
sides
declarations
of
the
people


s
loyalty

that
the
declaration
from
Petersburg
gave
him
particular
pleasure

and
that
he
was
proud
to
be
at
the
head
of
such
a
nation
and
would
endeavor
to
be
worthy
of
it

This
rescript
began
with
the
words




Serg

y
Kuzm

ch

From
all
sides
reports
reach
me




etc





Well

and
so
he
never
got
farther
than




Serg

y
Kuzm

ch







asked
one
of
the
ladies





Exactly

not
a
hair


s
breadth
farther




answered
Prince
Vas

li

laughing







Serg

y
Kuzm

ch



From
all
sides



From
all
sides



Serg

y
Kuzm

ch






Poor
Vyazm

tinov
could
not
get
any
farther

He
began
the
rescript
again
and
again

but
as
soon
as
he
uttered



Serg

y



he
sobbed




Kuz
m


ch




tears

and



From
all
sides



was
smothered
in
sobs
and
he
could
get
no
farther

And
again
his
handkerchief

and
again




Serg

y
Kuzm

ch

From
all
sides







and
tears

till
at
last
somebody
else
was
asked
to
read
it








Kuzm

ch



From
all
sides



and
then
tears




someone
repeated
laughing

t
be
unkind




cried
Anna
P

vlovna
from
her
end
of
the
table
holding
up
a
threatening
finger




He
is
such
a
worthy
and
excellent
man

our
dear
Vyazm

tinov








Everybody
laughed
a
great
deal

At
the
head
of
the
table

where
the
honored
guests
sat

everyone
seemed
to
be
in
high
spirits
and
under
the
influence
of
a
variety
of
exciting
sensations

Only
Pierre
and
H

l

ne
sat
silently
side
by
side
almost
at
the
bottom
of
the
table

a
suppressed
smile
brightening
both
their
faces

a
smile
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
Serg

y
Kuzm

ch


a
smile
of
bashfulness
at
their
own
feelings

But
much
as
all
the
rest
laughed

talked

and
joked

much
as
they
enjoyed
their
Rhine
wine

saut



and
ices

and
however
they
avoided
looking
at
the
young
couple

and
heedless
and
unobservant
as
they
seemed
of
them

one
could
feel
by
the
occasional
glances
they
gave
that
the
story
about
Serg

y
Kuzm

ch

the
laughter

and
the
food
were
all
a
pretense

and
that
the
whole
attention
of
that
company
was
directed
to


Pierre
and
H

l

ne

Prince
Vas

li
mimicked
the
sobbing
of
Serg

y
Kuzm

ch
and
at
the
same
time
his
eyes
glanced
toward
his
daughter

and
while
he
laughed
the
expression
on
his
face
clearly
said




Yes



it


s
getting
on

it
will
all
be
settled
today




Anna
P

vlovna
threatened
him
on
behalf
of



our
dear
Vyazm

tinov




and
in
her
eyes

which

for
an
instant

glanced
at
Pierre

Prince
Vas

li
read
a
congratulation
on
his
future
son
in
law
and
on
his
daughter


s
happiness

The
old
princess
sighed
sadly
as
she
offered
some
wine
to
the
old
lady
next
to
her
and
glanced
angrily
at
her
daughter

and
her
sigh
seemed
to
say




Yes

there


s
nothing
left
for
you
and
me
but
to
sip
sweet
wine

my
dear

now
that
the
time
has
come
for
these
young
ones
to
be
thus
boldly

provocatively
happy







And
what
nonsense
all
this
is
that
I
am
saying




thought
a
diplomatist

glancing
at
the
happy
faces
of
the
lovers




That


s
happiness





Into
the
insignificant

trifling

and
artificial
interests
uniting
that
society
had
entered
the
simple
feeling
of
the
attraction
of
a
healthy
and
handsome
young
man
and
woman
for
one
another

And
this
human
feeling
dominated
everything
else
and
soared
above
all
their
affected
chatter

Jests
fell
flat

news
was
not
interesting

and
the
animation
was
evidently
forced

Not
only
the
guests
but
even
the
footmen
waiting
at
table
seemed
to
feel
this

and
they
forgot
their
duties
as
they
looked
at
the
beautiful
H

l

ne
with
her
radiant
face
and
at
the
red

broad

and
happy
though
uneasy
face
of
Pierre

It
seemed
as
if
the
very
light
of
the
candles
was
focused
on
those
two
happy
faces
alone


Pierre
felt
that
he
was
the
center
of
it
all

and
this
both
pleased
and
embarrassed
him

He
was
like
a
man
entirely
absorbed
in
some
occupation

He
did
not
see

hear

or
understand
anything
clearly

Only
now
and
then
detached
ideas
and
impressions
from
the
world
of
reality
shot
unexpectedly
through
his
mind





So
it
is
all
finished




he
thought




And
how
has
it
all
happened

How
quickly

Now
I
know
that
not
because
of
her
alone

nor
of
myself
alone

but
because
of
everyone

it
must
inevitably
come
about

They
are
all
expecting
it

they
are
so
sure
that
it
will
happen
that
I
cannot

I
cannot

disappoint
them

But
how
will
it
be

I
do
not
know

but
it
will
certainly
happen




thought
Pierre

glancing
at
those
dazzling
shoulders
close
to
his
eyes


Or
he
would
suddenly
feel
ashamed
of
he
knew
not
what

He
felt
it
awkward
to
attract
everyone


s
attention
and
to
be
considered
a
lucky
man
and

with
his
plain
face

to
be
looked
on
as
a
sort
of
Paris
possessed
of
a
Helen




But
no
doubt
it
always
is
and
must
be
so




he
consoled
himself




And
besides

what
have
I
done
to
bring
it
about

How
did
it
begin

I
traveled
from
Moscow
with
Prince
Vas

li

Then
there
was
nothing

So
why
should
I
not
stay
at
his
house

Then
I
played
cards
with
her
and
picked
up
her
reticule
and
drove
out
with
her

How
did
it
begin

when
did
it
all
come
about




And
here
he
was
sitting
by
her
side
as
her
betrothed

seeing

hearing

feeling
her
nearness

her
breathing

her
movements

her
beauty

Then
it
would
suddenly
seem
to
him
that
it
was
not
she
but
he
was
so
unusually
beautiful

and
that
that
was
why
they
all
looked
so
at
him

and
flattered
by
this
general
admiration
he
would
expand
his
chest

raise
his
head

and
rejoice
at
his
good
fortune

Suddenly
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
repeating
something
to
him
a
second
time

But
Pierre
was
so
absorbed
that
he
did
not
understand
what
was
said





I
am
asking
you
when
you
last
heard
from
Bolk

nski




repeated
Prince
Vas

li
a
third
time




How
absent
minded
you
are

my
dear
fellow





Prince
Vas

li
smiled

and
Pierre
noticed
that
everyone
was
smiling
at
him
and
H

l

ne




Well

what
of
it

if
you
all
know
it




thought
Pierre




What
of
it

It


s
the
truth




and
he
himself
smiled
his
gentle
childlike
smile

and
H

l

ne
smiled
too





When
did
you
get
the
letter

Was
it
from
Olm

tz




repeated
Prince
Vas

li

who
pretended
to
want
to
know
this
in
order
to
settle
a
dispute





How
can
one
talk
or
think
of
such
trifles




thought
Pierre





Yes

from
Olm

tz




he
answered

with
a
sigh


After
supper
Pierre
with
his
partner
followed
the
others
into
the
drawing
room

The
guests
began
to
disperse

some
without
taking
leave
of
H

l

ne

Some

as
if
unwilling
to
distract
her
from
an
important
occupation

came
up
to
her
for
a
moment
and
made
haste
to
go
away

refusing
to
let
her
see
them
off

The
diplomatist
preserved
a
mournful
silence
as
he
left
the
drawing
room

He
pictured
the
vanity
of
his
diplomatic
career
in
comparison
with
Pierre


s
happiness

The
old
general
grumbled
at
his
wife
when
she
asked
how
his
leg
was




Oh

the
old
fool




he
thought




That
Princess
H

l

ne
will
be
beautiful
still
when
she


s
fifty








I
think
I
may
congratulate
you




whispered
Anna
P

vlovna
to
the
old
princess

kissing
her
soundly




If
I
hadn


t
this
headache
I


d
have
stayed
longer





The
old
princess
did
not
reply

she
was
tormented
by
jealousy
of
her
daughter


s
happiness


While
the
guests
were
taking
their
leave
Pierre
remained
for
a
long
time
alone
with
H

l

ne
in
the
little
drawing
room
where
they
were
sitting

He
had
often
before

during
the
last
six
weeks

remained
alone
with
her

but
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
love

Now
he
felt
that
it
was
inevitable

but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
take
the
final
step

He
felt
ashamed

he
felt
that
he
was
occupying
someone
else


s
place
here
beside
H

l

ne




This
happiness
is
not
for
you




some
inner
voice
whispered
to
him




This
happiness
is
for
those
who
have
not
in
them
what
there
is
in
you





But

as
he
had
to
say
something

he
began
by
asking
her
whether
she
was
satisfied
with
the
party

She
replied
in
her
usual
simple
manner
that
this
name
day
of
hers
had
been
one
of
the
pleasantest
she
had
ever
had


Some
of
the
nearest
relatives
had
not
yet
left

They
were
sitting
in
the
large
drawing
room

Prince
Vas

li
came
up
to
Pierre
with
languid
footsteps

Pierre
rose
and
said
it
was
getting
late

Prince
Vas

li
gave
him
a
look
of
stern
inquiry

as
though
what
Pierre
had
just
said
was
so
strange
that
one
could
not
take
it
in

But
then
the
expression
of
severity
changed

and
he
drew
Pierre


s
hand
downwards

made
him
sit
down

and
smiled
affectionately





Well

L

lya




he
asked

turning
instantly
to
his
daughter
and
addressing
her
with
the
careless
tone
of
habitual
tenderness
natural
to
parents
who
have
petted
their
children
from
babyhood

but
which
Prince
Vas

li
had
only
acquired
by
imitating
other
parents


And
he
again
turned
to
Pierre





Serg

y
Kuzm

ch


From
all
sides






he
said

unbuttoning
the
top
button
of
his
waistcoat


Pierre
smiled

but
his
smile
showed
that
he
knew
it
was
not
the
story
about
Serg

y
Kuzm

ch
that
interested
Prince
Vas

li
just
then

and
Prince
Vas

li
saw
that
Pierre
knew
this

He
suddenly
muttered
something
and
went
away

It
seemed
to
Pierre
that
even
the
prince
was
disconcerted

The
sight
of
the
discomposure
of
that
old
man
of
the
world
touched
Pierre

he
looked
at
H

l

ne
and
she
too
seemed
disconcerted

and
her
look
seemed
to
say




Well

it
is
your
own
fault








The
step
must
be
taken
but
I
cannot

I
cannot




thought
Pierre

and
he
again
began
speaking
about
indifferent
matters

about
Serg

y
Kuzm

ch

asking
what
the
point
of
the
story
was
as
he
had
not
heard
it
properly

H

l

ne
answered
with
a
smile
that
she
too
had
missed
it


When
Prince
Vas

li
returned
to
the
drawing
room

the
princess

his
wife

was
talking
in
low
tones
to
the
elderly
lady
about
Pierre





Of
course

it
is
a
very
brilliant
match

but
happiness

my
dear










Marriages
are
made
in
heaven




replied
the
elderly
lady


Prince
Vas

li
passed
by

seeming
not
to
hear
the
ladies

and
sat
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room

He
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
dozing

His
head
sank
forward
and
then
he
roused
himself





Aline




he
said
to
his
wife




go
and
see
what
they
are
about





The
princess
went
up
to
the
door

passed
by
it
with
a
dignified
and
indifferent
air

and
glanced
into
the
little
drawing
room

Pierre
and
H

l

ne
still
sat
talking
just
as
before





Still
the
same




she
said
to
her
husband


Prince
Vas

li
frowned

twisting
his
mouth

his
cheeks
quivered
and
his
face
assumed
the
coarse

unpleasant
expression
peculiar
to
him

Shaking
himself

he
rose

threw
back
his
head

and
with
resolute
steps
went
past
the
ladies
into
the
little
drawing
room

With
quick
steps
he
went
joyfully
up
to
Pierre

His
face
was
so
unusually
triumphant
that
Pierre
rose
in
alarm
on
seeing
it





Thank
God




said
Prince
Vas

li




My
wife
has
told
me
everything





He
put
one
arm
around
Pierre
and
the
other
around
his
daughter







My
dear
boy



L

lya



I
am
very
pleased





His
voice
trembled





I
loved
your
father



and
she
will
make
you
a
good
wife



God
bless
you








He
embraced
his
daughter

and
then
again
Pierre

and
kissed
him
with
his
malodorous
mouth

Tears
actually
moistened
his
cheeks





Princess

come
here




he
shouted


The
old
princess
came
in
and
also
wept

The
elderly
lady
was
using
her
handkerchief
too

Pierre
was
kissed

and
he
kissed
the
beautiful
H

l

ne


s
hand
several
times

After
a
while
they
were
left
alone
again





All
this
had
to
be
and
could
not
be
otherwise




thought
Pierre




so
it
is
useless
to
ask
whether
it
is
good
or
bad

It
is
good
because
it


s
definite
and
one
is
rid
of
the
old
tormenting
doubt




Pierre
held
the
hand
of
his
betrothed
in
silence

looking
at
her
beautiful
bosom
as
it
rose
and
fell





H

l

ne




he
said
aloud
and
paused





Something
special
is
always
said
in
such
cases




he
thought

but
could
not
remember
what
it
was
that
people
say

He
looked
at
her
face

She
drew
nearer
to
him

Her
face
flushed





Oh

take
those
off



those






she
said

pointing
to
his
spectacles


Pierre
took
them
off

and
his
eyes

besides
the
strange
look
eyes
have
from
which
spectacles
have
just
been
removed

had
also
a
frightened
and
inquiring
look

He
was
about
to
stoop
over
her
hand
and
kiss
it

but
with
a
rapid

almost
brutal
movement
of
her
head

she
intercepted
his
lips
and
met
them
with
her
own

Her
face
struck
Pierre

by
its
altered

unpleasantly
excited
expression





It
is
too
late
now

it


s
done

besides
I
love
her




thought
Pierre





Je
vous
aime






he
said

remembering
what
has
to
be
said
at
such
moments

but
his
words
sounded
so
weak
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself











I
love
you






Six
weeks
later
he
was
married

and
settled
in
Count
Bez

khov


s
large

newly
furnished
Petersburg
house

the
happy
possessor

as
people
said

of
a
wife
who
was
a
celebrated
beauty
and
of
millions
of
money






CHAPTER
III

Old
Prince
Nicholas
Bolk

nski
received
a
letter
from
Prince
Vas

li
in
November







announcing
that
he
and
his
son
would
be
paying
him
a
visit




I
am
starting
on
a
journey
of
inspection

and
of
course
I
shall
think
nothing
of
an
extra
seventy
miles
to
come
and
see
you
at
the
same
time

my
honored
benefactor




wrote
Prince
Vas

li




My
son
Anatole
is
accompanying
me
on
his
way
to
the
army

so
I
hope
you
will
allow
him
personally
to
express
the
deep
respect
that

emulating
his
father

he
feels
for
you








It
seems
that
there
will
be
no
need
to
bring
Mary
out

suitors
are
coming
to
us
of
their
own
accord




incautiously
remarked
the
little
princess
on
hearing
the
news


Prince
Nicholas
frowned

but
said
nothing


A
fortnight
after
the
letter
Prince
Vas

li


s
servants
came
one
evening
in
advance
of
him

and
he
and
his
son
arrived
next
day


Old
Bolk

nski
had
always
had
a
poor
opinion
of
Prince
Vas

li


s
character

but
more
so
recently

since
in
the
new
reigns
of
Paul
and
Alexander
Prince
Vas

li
had
risen
to
high
position
and
honors

And
now

from
the
hints
contained
in
his
letter
and
given
by
the
little
princess

he
saw
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing

and
his
low
opinion
changed
into
a
feeling
of
contemptuous
ill
will

He
snorted
whenever
he
mentioned
him

On
the
day
of
Prince
Vas

li


s
arrival

Prince
Bolk

nski
was
particularly
discontented
and
out
of
temper

Whether
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
because
Prince
Vas

li
was
coming

or
whether
his
being
in
a
bad
temper
made
him
specially
annoyed
at
Prince
Vas

li


s
visit

he
was
in
a
bad
temper

and
in
the
morning
T

khon
had
already
advised
the
architect
not
to
go
to
the
prince
with
his
report





Do
you
hear
how
he


s
walking




said
T

khon

drawing
the
architect


s
attention
to
the
sound
of
the
prince


s
footsteps




Stepping
flat
on
his
heels


we
know
what
that
means








However

at
nine
o


clock
the
prince

in
his
velvet
coat
with
a
sable
collar
and
cap

went
out
for
his
usual
walk

It
had
snowed
the
day
before
and
the
path
to
the
hothouse

along
which
the
prince
was
in
the
habit
of
walking

had
been
swept

the
marks
of
the
broom
were
still
visible
in
the
snow
and
a
shovel
had
been
left
sticking
in
one
of
the
soft
snowbanks
that
bordered
both
sides
of
the
path

The
prince
went
through
the
conservatories

the
serfs



quarters

and
the
outbuildings

frowning
and
silent





Can
a
sleigh
pass




he
asked
his
overseer

a
venerable
man

resembling
his
master
in
manners
and
looks

who
was
accompanying
him
back
to
the
house





The
snow
is
deep

I
am
having
the
avenue
swept

your
honor





The
prince
bowed
his
head
and
went
up
to
the
porch




God
be
thanked




thought
the
overseer




the
storm
has
blown
over








It
would
have
been
hard
to
drive
up

your
honor




he
added




I
heard

your
honor

that
a
minister
is
coming
to
visit
your
honor





The
prince
turned
round
to
the
overseer
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
him

frowning





What

A
minister

What
minister

Who
gave
orders




he
said
in
his
shrill

harsh
voice




The
road
is
not
swept
for
the
princess
my
daughter

but
for
a
minister

For
me

there
are
no
ministers








Your
honor

I
thought










You
thought




shouted
the
prince

his
words
coming
more
and
more
rapidly
and
indistinctly




You
thought




Rascals

Blackguards




I


ll
teach
you
to
think




and
lifting
his
stick
he
swung
it
and
would
have
hit
Alp

tych

the
overseer

had
not
the
latter
instinctively
avoided
the
blow




Thought



Blackguards






shouted
the
prince
rapidly


But
although
Alp

tych

frightened
at
his
own
temerity
in
avoiding
the
stroke

came
up
to
the
prince

bowing
his
bald
head
resignedly
before
him

or
perhaps
for
that
very
reason

the
prince

though
he
continued
to
shout




Blackguards




Throw
the
snow
back
on
the
road




did
not
lift
his
stick
again
but
hurried
into
the
house


Before
dinner

Princess
Mary
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

who
knew
that
the
prince
was
in
a
bad
humor

stood
awaiting
him

Mademoiselle
Bourienne
with
a
radiant
face
that
said




I
know
nothing

I
am
the
same
as
usual




and
Princess
Mary
pale

frightened

and
with
downcast
eyes

What
she
found
hardest
to
bear
was
to
know
that
on
such
occasions
she
ought
to
behave
like
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

but
could
not

She
thought




If
I
seem
not
to
notice
he
will
think
that
I
do
not
sympathize
with
him

if
I
seem
sad
and
out
of
spirits
myself

he
will
say

as
he
has
done
before

that
I


m
in
the
dumps





The
prince
looked
at
his
daughter


s
frightened
face
and
snorted





Fool



or
dummy




he
muttered





And
the
other
one
is
not
here

They


ve
been
telling
tales




he
thought


referring
to
the
little
princess
who
was
not
in
the
dining
room





Where
is
the
princess




he
asked




Hiding








She
is
not
very
well




answered
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
with
a
bright
smile




so
she
won


t
come
down

It
is
natural
in
her
state








Hm

Hm




muttered
the
prince

sitting
down


His
plate
seemed
to
him
not
quite
clean

and
pointing
to
a
spot
he
flung
it
away

T

khon
caught
it
and
handed
it
to
a
footman

The
little
princess
was
not
unwell

but
had
such
an
overpowering
fear
of
the
prince
that

hearing
he
was
in
a
bad
humor

she
had
decided
not
to
appear





I
am
afraid
for
the
baby




she
said
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne




Heaven
knows
what
a
fright
might
do





In
general
at
Bald
Hills
the
little
princess
lived
in
constant
fear

and
with
a
sense
of
antipathy
to
the
old
prince
which
she
did
not
realize
because
the
fear
was
so
much
the
stronger
feeling

The
prince
reciprocated
this
antipathy

but
it
was
overpowered
by
his
contempt
for
her

When
the
little
princess
had
grown
accustomed
to
life
at
Bald
Hills

she
took
a
special
fancy
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

spent
whole
days
with
her

asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
room

and
often
talked
with
her
about
the
old
prince
and
criticized
him





So
we
are
to
have
visitors

mon
prince




remarked
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

unfolding
her
white
napkin
with
her
rosy
fingers




His
Excellency
Prince
Vas

li
Kur

gin
and
his
son

I
understand




she
said
inquiringly





Hm



his
excellency
is
a
puppy




I
got
him
his
appointment
in
the
service




said
the
prince
disdainfully




Why
his
son
is
coming
I
don


t
understand

Perhaps
Princess
Elizabeth
and
Princess
Mary
know

I
don


t
want
him





He
looked
at
his
blushing
daughter





Are
you
unwell
today

Eh

Afraid
of
the



minister



as
that
idiot
Alp

tych
called
him
this
morning








No

mon
p

re





Though
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
had
been
so
unsuccessful
in
her
choice
of
a
subject

she
did
not
stop
talking

but
chattered
about
the
conservatories
and
the
beauty
of
a
flower
that
had
just
opened

and
after
the
soup
the
prince
became
more
genial


After
dinner

he
went
to
see
his
daughter
in
law

The
little
princess
was
sitting
at
a
small
table

chattering
with
M

sha

her
maid

She
grew
pale
on
seeing
her
father
in
law


She
was
much
altered

She
was
now
plain
rather
than
pretty

Her
cheeks
had
sunk

her
lip
was
drawn
up

and
her
eyes
drawn
down





Yes

I
feel
a
kind
of
oppression




she
said
in
reply
to
the
prince


s
question
as
to
how
she
felt





Do
you
want
anything








No

merci

mon
p

re








Well

all
right

all
right





He
left
the
room
and
went
to
the
waiting
room
where
Alp

tych
stood
with
bowed
head





Has
the
snow
been
shoveled
back








Yes

your
excellency

Forgive
me
for
heaven


s
sake



It
was
only
my
stupidity








All
right

all
right




interrupted
the
prince

and
laughing
his
unnatural
way

he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
Alp

tych
to
kiss

and
then
proceeded
to
his
study


Prince
Vas

li
arrived
that
evening

He
was
met
in
the
avenue
by
coachmen
and
footmen

who

with
loud
shouts

dragged
his
sleighs
up
to
one
of
the
lodges
over
the
road
purposely
laden
with
snow


Prince
Vas

li
and
Anatole
had
separate
rooms
assigned
to
them


Anatole

having
taken
off
his
overcoat

sat
with
arms
akimbo
before
a
table
on
a
corner
of
which
he
smilingly
and
absent
mindedly
fixed
his
large
and
handsome
eyes

He
regarded
his
whole
life
as
a
continual
round
of
amusement
which
someone
for
some
reason
had
to
provide
for
him

And
he
looked
on
this
visit
to
a
churlish
old
man
and
a
rich
and
ugly
heiress
in
the
same
way

All
this
might

he
thought

turn
out
very
well
and
amusingly




And
why
not
marry
her
if
she
really
has
so
much
money

That
never
does
any
harm




thought
Anatole


He
shaved
and
scented
himself
with
the
care
and
elegance
which
had
become
habitual
to
him
and

his
handsome
head
held
high

entered
his
father


s
room
with
the
good
humored
and
victorious
air
natural
to
him

Prince
Vas

li


s
two
valets
were
busy
dressing
him

and
he
looked
round
with
much
animation
and
cheerfully
nodded
to
his
son
as
the
latter
entered

as
if
to
say




Yes

that


s
how
I
want
you
to
look








I
say

Father

joking
apart

is
she
very
hideous




Anatole
asked

as
if
continuing
a
conversation
the
subject
of
which
had
often
been
mentioned
during
the
journey





Enough

What
nonsense

Above
all

try
to
be
respectful
and
cautious
with
the
old
prince








If
he
starts
a
row
I


ll
go
away




said
Prince
Anatole




I
can


t
bear
those
old
men

Eh








Remember

for
you
everything
depends
on
this





In
the
meantime

not
only
was
it
known
in
the
maidservants



rooms
that
the
minister
and
his
son
had
arrived

but
the
appearance
of
both
had
been
minutely
described

Princess
Mary
was
sitting
alone
in
her
room

vainly
trying
to
master
her
agitation





Why
did
they
write

why
did
Lise
tell
me
about
it

It
can
never
happen




she
said

looking
at
herself
in
the
glass




How
shall
I
enter
the
drawing
room

Even
if
I
like
him
I
can


t
now
be
myself
with
him




The
mere
thought
of
her
father


s
look
filled
her
with
terror

The
little
princess
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
had
already
received
from
M

sha

the
lady


s
maid

the
necessary
report
of
how
handsome
the
minister


s
son
was

with
his
rosy
cheeks
and
dark
eyebrows

and
with
what
difficulty
the
father
had
dragged
his
legs
upstairs
while
the
son
had
followed
him
like
an
eagle

three
steps
at
a
time

Having
received
this
information

the
little
princess
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

whose
chattering
voices
had
reached
her
from
the
corridor

went
into
Princess
Mary


s
room





You
know
they


ve
come

Marie




said
the
little
princess

waddling
in

and
sinking
heavily
into
an
armchair


She
was
no
longer
in
the
loose
gown
she
generally
wore
in
the
morning

but
had
on
one
of
her
best
dresses

Her
hair
was
carefully
done
and
her
face
was
animated

which

however

did
not
conceal
its
sunken
and
faded
outlines

Dressed
as
she
used
to
be
in
Petersburg
society

it
was
still
more
noticeable
how
much
plainer
she
had
become

Some
unobtrusive
touch
had
been
added
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne


s
toilet
which
rendered
her
fresh
and
pretty
face
yet
more
attractive





What

Are
you
going
to
remain
as
you
are

dear
princess




she
began




They


ll
be
announcing
that
the
gentlemen
are
in
the
drawing
room
and
we
shall
have
to
go
down

and
you
have
not
smartened
yourself
up
at
all





The
little
princess
got
up

rang
for
the
maid

and
hurriedly
and
merrily
began
to
devise
and
carry
out
a
plan
of
how
Princess
Mary
should
be
dressed

Princess
Mary


s
self
esteem
was
wounded
by
the
fact
that
the
arrival
of
a
suitor
agitated
her

and
still
more
so
by
both
her
companions



not
having
the
least
conception
that
it
could
be
otherwise

To
tell
them
that
she
felt
ashamed
for
herself
and
for
them
would
be
to
betray
her
agitation

while
to
decline
their
offers
to
dress
her
would
prolong
their
banter
and
insistence

She
flushed

her
beautiful
eyes
grew
dim

red
blotches
came
on
her
face

and
it
took
on
the
unattractive
martyrlike
expression
it
so
often
wore

as
she
submitted
herself
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
Lise

Both
these
women
quite
sincerely
tried
to
make
her
look
pretty

She
was
so
plain
that
neither
of
them
could
think
of
her
as
a
rival

so
they
began
dressing
her
with
perfect
sincerity

and
with
the
na

ve
and
firm
conviction
women
have
that
dress
can
make
a
face
pretty





No
really

my
dear

this
dress
is
not
pretty




said
Lise

looking
sideways
at
Princess
Mary
from
a
little
distance




You
have
a
maroon
dress

have
it
fetched

Really

You
know
the
fate
of
your
whole
life
may
be
at
stake

But
this
one
is
too
light

it


s
not
becoming





It
was
not
the
dress

but
the
face
and
whole
figure
of
Princess
Mary
that
was
not
pretty

but
neither
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
nor
the
little
princess
felt
this

they
still
thought
that
if
a
blue
ribbon
were
placed
in
the
hair

the
hair
combed
up

and
the
blue
scarf
arranged
lower
on
the
best
maroon
dress

and
so
on

all
would
be
well

They
forgot
that
the
frightened
face
and
the
figure
could
not
be
altered

and
that
however
they
might
change
the
setting
and
adornment
of
that
face

it
would
still
remain
piteous
and
plain

After
two
or
three
changes
to
which
Princess
Mary
meekly
submitted

just
as
her
hair
had
been
arranged
on
the
top
of
her
head

a
style
that
quite
altered
and
spoiled
her
looks

and
she
had
put
on
a
maroon
dress
with
a
pale
blue
scarf

the
little
princess
walked
twice
round
her

now
adjusting
a
fold
of
the
dress
with
her
little
hand

now
arranging
the
scarf
and
looking
at
her
with
her
head
bent
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other





No

it
will
not
do




she
said
decidedly

clasping
her
hands




No

Mary

really
this
dress
does
not
suit
you

I
prefer
you
in
your
little
gray
everyday
dress

Now
please

do
it
for
my
sake

Katie




she
said
to
the
maid




bring
the
princess
her
gray
dress

and
you


ll
see

Mademoiselle
Bourienne

how
I
shall
arrange
it




she
added

smiling
with
a
foretaste
of
artistic
pleasure


But
when
Katie
brought
the
required
dress

Princess
Mary
remained
sitting
motionless
before
the
glass

looking
at
her
face

and
saw
in
the
mirror
her
eyes
full
of
tears
and
her
mouth
quivering

ready
to
burst
into
sobs





Come

dear
princess




said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne




just
one
more
little
effort





The
little
princess

taking
the
dress
from
the
maid

came
up
to
Princess
Mary





Well

now
we


ll
arrange
something
quite
simple
and
becoming




she
said


The
three
voices

hers

Mademoiselle
Bourienne


s

and
Katie


s

who
was
laughing
at
something

mingled
in
a
merry
sound

like
the
chirping
of
birds





No

leave
me
alone




said
Princess
Mary


Her
voice
sounded
so
serious
and
so
sad
that
the
chirping
of
the
birds
was
silenced
at
once

They
looked
at
the
beautiful

large

thoughtful
eyes
full
of
tears
and
of
thoughts

gazing
shiningly
and
imploringly
at
them

and
understood
that
it
was
useless
and
even
cruel
to
insist





At
least

change
your
coiffure




said
the
little
princess




Didn


t
I
tell
you




she
went
on

turning
reproachfully
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne




Mary


s
is
a
face
which
such
a
coiffure
does
not
suit
in
the
least

Not
in
the
least

Please
change
it








Leave
me
alone

please
leave
me
alone

It
is
all
quite
the
same
to
me




answered
a
voice
struggling
with
tears


Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
the
little
princess
had
to
own
to
themselves
that
Princess
Mary
in
this
guise
looked
very
plain

worse
than
usual

but
it
was
too
late

She
was
looking
at
them
with
an
expression
they
both
knew

an
expression
thoughtful
and
sad

This
expression
in
Princess
Mary
did
not
frighten
them

she
never
inspired
fear
in
anyone


but
they
knew
that
when
it
appeared
on
her
face

she
became
mute
and
was
not
to
be
shaken
in
her
determination





You
will
change
it

won


t
you




said
Lise

And
as
Princess
Mary
gave
no
answer

she
left
the
room


Princess
Mary
was
left
alone

She
did
not
comply
with
Lise


s
request

she
not
only
left
her
hair
as
it
was

but
did
not
even
look
in
her
glass

Letting
her
arms
fall
helplessly

she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
and
pondered

A
husband

a
man

a
strong
dominant
and
strangely
attractive
being
rose
in
her
imagination

and
carried
her
into
a
totally
different
happy
world
of
his
own

She
fancied
a
child

her
own


such
as
she
had
seen
the
day
before
in
the
arms
of
her
nurse


s
daughter


at
her
own
breast

the
husband
standing
by
and
gazing
tenderly
at
her
and
the
child




But
no

it
is
impossible

I
am
too
ugly




she
thought





Please
come
to
tea

The
prince
will
be
out
in
a
moment




came
the
maid


s
voice
at
the
door


She
roused
herself

and
felt
appalled
at
what
she
had
been
thinking

and
before
going
down
she
went
into
the
room
where
the
icons
hung
and

her
eyes
fixed
on
the
dark
face
of
a
large
icon
of
the
Saviour
lit
by
a
lamp

she
stood
before
it
with
folded
hands
for
a
few
moments

A
painful
doubt
filled
her
soul

Could
the
joy
of
love

of
earthly
love
for
a
man

be
for
her

In
her
thoughts
of
marriage
Princess
Mary
dreamed
of
happiness
and
of
children

but
her
strongest

most
deeply
hidden
longing
was
for
earthly
love

The
more
she
tried
to
hide
this
feeling
from
others
and
even
from
herself

the
stronger
it
grew




O
God




she
said




how
am
I
to
stifle
in
my
heart
these
temptations
of
the
devil

How
am
I
to
renounce
forever
these
vile
fancies

so
as
peacefully
to
fulfill
Thy
will




And
scarcely
had
she
put
that
question
than
God
gave
her
the
answer
in
her
own
heart




Desire
nothing
for
thyself

seek
nothing

be
not
anxious
or
envious

Man


s
future
and
thy
own
fate
must
remain
hidden
from
thee

but
live
so
that
thou
mayest
be
ready
for
anything

If
it
be
God


s
will
to
prove
thee
in
the
duties
of
marriage

be
ready
to
fulfill
His
will




With
this
consoling
thought

but
yet
with
a
hope
for
the
fulfillment
of
her
forbidden
earthly
longing

Princess
Mary
sighed

and
having
crossed
herself
went
down

thinking
neither
of
her
gown
and
coiffure
nor
of
how
she
would
go
in
nor
of
what
she
would
say

What
could
all
that
matter
in
comparison
with
the
will
of
God

without
Whose
care
not
a
hair
of
man


s
head
can
fall






CHAPTER
IV

When
Princess
Mary
came
down

Prince
Vas

li
and
his
son
were
already
in
the
drawing
room

talking
to
the
little
princess
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

When
she
entered
with
her
heavy
step

treading
on
her
heels

the
gentlemen
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
rose
and
the
little
princess

indicating
her
to
the
gentlemen

said




Voil


Marie




Princess
Mary
saw
them
all
and
saw
them
in
detail

She
saw
Prince
Vas

li


s
face

serious
for
an
instant
at
the
sight
of
her

but
immediately
smiling
again

and
the
little
princess
curiously
noting
the
impression



Marie



produced
on
the
visitors

And
she
saw
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

with
her
ribbon
and
pretty
face

and
her
unusually
animated
look
which
was
fixed
on
him

but
him
she
could
not
see

she
only
saw
something
large

brilliant

and
handsome
moving
toward
her
as
she
entered
the
room

Prince
Vas

li
approached
first

and
she
kissed
the
bold
forehead
that
bent
over
her
hand
and
answered
his
question
by
saying
that

on
the
contrary

she
remembered
him
quite
well

Then
Anatole
came
up
to
her

She
still
could
not
see
him

She
only
felt
a
soft
hand
taking
hers
firmly

and
she
touched
with
her
lips
a
white
forehead

over
which
was
beautiful
light
brown
hair
smelling
of
pomade

When
she
looked
up
at
him
she
was
struck
by
his
beauty

Anatole
stood
with
his
right
thumb
under
a
button
of
his
uniform

his
chest
expanded
and
his
back
drawn
in

slightly
swinging
one
foot

and

with
his
head
a
little
bent

looked
with
beaming
face
at
the
princess
without
speaking
and
evidently
not
thinking
about
her
at
all

Anatole
was
not
quick
witted

nor
ready
or
eloquent
in
conversation

but
he
had
the
faculty

so
invaluable
in
society

of
composure
and
imperturbable
self
possession

If
a
man
lacking
in
self
confidence
remains
dumb
on
a
first
introduction
and
betrays
a
consciousness
of
the
impropriety
of
such
silence
and
an
anxiety
to
find
something
to
say

the
effect
is
bad

But
Anatole
was
dumb

swung
his
foot

and
smilingly
examined
the
princess



hair

It
was
evident
that
he
could
be
silent
in
this
way
for
a
very
long
time




If
anyone
finds
this
silence
inconvenient

let
him
talk

but
I
don


t
want
to




he
seemed
to
say

Besides
this

in
his
behavior
to
women
Anatole
had
a
manner
which
particularly
inspires
in
them
curiosity

awe

and
even
love


a
supercilious
consciousness
of
his
own
superiority

It
was
as
if
he
said
to
them




I
know
you

I
know
you

but
why
should
I
bother
about
you

You


d
be
only
too
glad

of
course




Perhaps
he
did
not
really
think
this
when
he
met
women


even
probably
he
did
not

for
in
general
he
thought
very
little


but
his
looks
and
manner
gave
that
impression

The
princess
felt
this

and
as
if
wishing
to
show
him
that
she
did
not
even
dare
expect
to
interest
him

she
turned
to
his
father

The
conversation
was
general
and
animated

thanks
to
Princess
Lise


s
voice
and
little
downy
lip
that
lifted
over
her
white
teeth

She
met
Prince
Vas

li
with
that
playful
manner
often
employed
by
lively
chatty
people

and
consisting
in
the
assumption
that
between
the
person
they
so
address
and
themselves
there
are
some
semi
private

long
established
jokes
and
amusing
reminiscences

though
no
such
reminiscences
really
exist


just
as
none
existed
in
this
case

Prince
Vas

li
readily
adopted
her
tone
and
the
little
princess
also
drew
Anatole

whom
she
hardly
knew

into
these
amusing
recollections
of
things
that
had
never
occurred

Mademoiselle
Bourienne
also
shared
them
and
even
Princess
Mary
felt
herself
pleasantly
made
to
share
in
these
merry
reminiscences





Here
at
least
we
shall
have
the
benefit
of
your
company
all
to
ourselves

dear
prince




said
the
little
princess

of
course

in
French

to
Prince
Vas

li




It


s
not
as
at
Annette


s


receptions
where
you
always
ran
away

you
remember
cette
ch

re
Annette











Anna
P

vlovna





Ah

but
you
won


t
talk
politics
to
me
like
Annette








And
our
little
tea
table








Oh

yes








Why
is
it
you
were
never
at
Annette


s




the
little
princess
asked
Anatole




Ah

I
know

I
know




she
said
with
a
sly
glance




your
brother
Hippolyte
told
me
about
your
goings
on

Oh




and
she
shook
her
finger
at
him




I
have
even
heard
of
your
doings
in
Paris








And
didn


t
Hippolyte
tell
you




asked
Prince
Vas

li

turning
to
his
son
and
seizing
the
little
princess



arm
as
if
she
would
have
run
away
and
he
had
just
managed
to
catch
her




didn


t
he
tell
you
how
he
himself
was
pining
for
the
dear
princess

and
how
she
showed
him
the
door

Oh

she
is
a
pearl
among
women

Princess




he
added

turning
to
Princess
Mary


When
Paris
was
mentioned

Mademoiselle
Bourienne
for
her
part
seized
the
opportunity
of
joining
in
the
general
current
of
recollections


She
took
the
liberty
of
inquiring
whether
it
was
long
since
Anatole
had
left
Paris
and
how
he
had
liked
that
city

Anatole
answered
the
Frenchwoman
very
readily
and

looking
at
her
with
a
smile

talked
to
her
about
her
native
land

When
he
saw
the
pretty
little
Bourienne

Anatole
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
not
find
Bald
Hills
dull
either




Not
at
all
bad




he
thought

examining
her




not
at
all
bad

that
little
companion

I
hope
she
will
bring
her
along
with
her
when
we


re
married

la
petite
est
gentille













The
little
one
is
charming


The
old
prince
dressed
leisurely
in
his
study

frowning
and
considering
what
he
was
to
do

The
coming
of
these
visitors
annoyed
him




What
are
Prince
Vas

li
and
that
son
of
his
to
me

Prince
Vas

li
is
a
shallow
braggart
and
his
son

no
doubt

is
a
fine
specimen




he
grumbled
to
himself

What
angered
him
was
that
the
coming
of
these
visitors
revived
in
his
mind
an
unsettled
question
he
always
tried
to
stifle

one
about
which
he
always
deceived
himself

The
question
was
whether
he
could
ever
bring
himself
to
part
from
his
daughter
and
give
her
to
a
husband

The
prince
never
directly
asked
himself
that
question

knowing
beforehand
that
he
would
have
to
answer
it
justly

and
justice
clashed
not
only
with
his
feelings
but
with
the
very
possibility
of
life

Life
without
Princess
Mary

little
as
he
seemed
to
value
her

was
unthinkable
to
him




And
why
should
she
marry




he
thought




To
be
unhappy
for
certain

There


s
Lise

married
to
Andrew


a
better
husband
one
would
think
could
hardly
be
found
nowadays


but
is
she
contented
with
her
lot

And
who
would
marry
Marie
for
love

Plain
and
awkward

They


ll
take
her
for
her
connections
and
wealth

Are
there
no
women
living
unmarried

and
even
the
happier
for
it




So
thought
Prince
Bolk

nski
while
dressing

and
yet
the
question
he
was
always
putting
off
demanded
an
immediate
answer

Prince
Vas

li
had
brought
his
son
with
the
evident
intention
of
proposing

and
today
or
tomorrow
he
would
probably
ask
for
an
answer

His
birth
and
position
in
society
were
not
bad




Well

I


ve
nothing
against
it




the
prince
said
to
himself




but
he
must
be
worthy
of
her

And
that
is
what
we
shall
see








That
is
what
we
shall
see

That
is
what
we
shall
see




he
added
aloud


He
entered
the
drawing
room
with
his
usual
alert
step

glancing
rapidly
round
the
company

He
noticed
the
change
in
the
little
princess



dress

Mademoiselle
Bourienne


s
ribbon

Princess
Mary


s
unbecoming
coiffure

Mademoiselle
Bourienne


s
and
Anatole


s
smiles

and
the
loneliness
of
his
daughter
amid
the
general
conversation




Got
herself
up
like
a
fool




he
thought

looking
irritably
at
her




She
is
shameless

and
he
ignores
her





He
went
straight
up
to
Prince
Vas

li





Well

How
d


ye
do

How
d


ye
do

Glad
to
see
you








Friendship
laughs
at
distance




began
Prince
Vas

li
in
his
usual
rapid

self
confident

familiar
tone




Here
is
my
second
son

please
love
and
befriend
him





Prince
Bolk

nski
surveyed
Anatole





Fine
young
fellow

Fine
young
fellow




he
said




Well

come
and
kiss
me




and
he
offered
his
cheek


Anatole
kissed
the
old
man

and
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
and
perfect
composure

waiting
for
a
display
of
the
eccentricities
his
father
had
told
him
to
expect


Prince
Bolk

nski
sat
down
in
his
usual
place
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and

drawing
up
an
armchair
for
Prince
Vas

li

pointed
to
it
and
began
questioning
him
about
political
affairs
and
news

He
seemed
to
listen
attentively
to
what
Prince
Vas

li
said

but
kept
glancing
at
Princess
Mary





And
so
they
are
writing
from
Potsdam
already




he
said

repeating
Prince
Vas

li


s
last
words

Then
rising

he
suddenly
went
up
to
his
daughter





Is
it
for
visitors
you


ve
got
yourself
up
like
that

eh




said
he




Fine

very
fine

You
have
done
up
your
hair
in
this
new
way
for
the
visitors

and
before
the
visitors
I
tell
you
that
in
future
you
are
never
to
dare
to
change
your
way
of
dress
without
my
consent








It
was
my
fault

mon
p

re




interceded
the
little
princess

with
a
blush





You
must
do
as
you
please




said
Prince
Bolk

nski

bowing
to
his
daughter
in
law




but
she
need
not
make
a
fool
of
herself

she


s
plain
enough
as
it
is





And
he
sat
down
again

paying
no
more
attention
to
his
daughter

who
was
reduced
to
tears





On
the
contrary

that
coiffure
suits
the
princess
very
well




said
Prince
Vas

li





Now
you

young
prince

what


s
your
name




said
Prince
Bolk

nski

turning
to
Anatole




come
here

let
us
talk
and
get
acquainted








Now
the
fun
begins




thought
Anatole

sitting
down
with
a
smile
beside
the
old
prince





Well

my
dear
boy

I
hear
you


ve
been
educated
abroad

not
taught
to
read
and
write
by
the
deacon

like
your
father
and
me

Now
tell
me

my
dear
boy

are
you
serving
in
the
Horse
Guards




asked
the
old
man

scrutinizing
Anatole
closely
and
intently





No

I
have
been
transferred
to
the
line




said
Anatole

hardly
able
to
restrain
his
laughter





Ah

That


s
a
good
thing

So

my
dear
boy

you
wish
to
serve
the
Tsar
and
the
country

It
is
wartime

Such
a
fine
fellow
must
serve

Well

are
you
off
to
the
front








No

Prince

our
regiment
has
gone
to
the
front

but
I
am
attached



what
is
it
I
am
attached
to

Papa




said
Anatole

turning
to
his
father
with
a
laugh





A
splendid
soldier

splendid




What
am
I
attached
to




Ha

ha

ha




laughed
Prince
Bolk

nski

and
Anatole
laughed
still
louder

Suddenly
Prince
Bolk

nski
frowned





You
may
go




he
said
to
Anatole


Anatole
returned
smiling
to
the
ladies





And
so
you


ve
had
him
educated
abroad

Prince
Vas

li

haven


t
you




said
the
old
prince
to
Prince
Vas

li





I
have
done
my
best
for
him

and
I
can
assure
you
the
education
there
is
much
better
than
ours








Yes

everything
is
different
nowadays

everything
is
changed

The
lad


s
a
fine
fellow

a
fine
fellow

Well

come
with
me
now




He
took
Prince
Vas

li


s
arm
and
led
him
to
his
study

As
soon
as
they
were
alone
together

Prince
Vas

li
announced
his
hopes
and
wishes
to
the
old
prince





Well

do
you
think
I
shall
prevent
her

that
I
can


t
part
from
her




said
the
old
prince
angrily




What
an
idea

I


m
ready
for
it
tomorrow

Only
let
me
tell
you

I
want
to
know
my
son
in
law
better

You
know
my
principles


everything
aboveboard

I
will
ask
her
tomorrow
in
your
presence

if
she
is
willing

then
he
can
stay
on

He
can
stay
and
I


ll
see




The
old
prince
snorted




Let
her
marry

it


s
all
the
same
to
me




he
screamed
in
the
same
piercing
tone
as
when
parting
from
his
son





I
will
tell
you
frankly




said
Prince
Vas

li
in
the
tone
of
a
crafty
man
convinced
of
the
futility
of
being
cunning
with
so
keen
sighted
a
companion




You
know

you
see
right
through
people

Anatole
is
no
genius

but
he
is
an
honest

goodhearted
lad

an
excellent
son
or
kinsman








All
right

all
right

we


ll
see





As
always
happens
when
women
lead
lonely
lives
for
any
length
of
time
without
male
society

on
Anatole


s
appearance
all
the
three
women
of
Prince
Bolk

nski


s
household
felt
that
their
life
had
not
been
real
till
then

Their
powers
of
reasoning

feeling

and
observing
immediately
increased
tenfold

and
their
life

which
seemed
to
have
been
passed
in
darkness

was
suddenly
lit
up
by
a
new
brightness

full
of
significance


Princess
Mary
grew
quite
unconscious
of
her
face
and
coiffure

The
handsome
open
face
of
the
man
who
might
perhaps
be
her
husband
absorbed
all
her
attention

He
seemed
to
her
kind

brave

determined

manly

and
magnanimous

She
felt
convinced
of
that

Thousands
of
dreams
of
a
future
family
life
continually
rose
in
her
imagination

She
drove
them
away
and
tried
to
conceal
them





But
am
I
not
too
cold
with
him




thought
the
princess




I
try
to
be
reserved
because
in
the
depth
of
my
soul
I
feel
too
near
to
him
already

but
then
he
cannot
know
what
I
think
of
him
and
may
imagine
that
I
do
not
like
him





And
Princess
Mary
tried

but
could
not
manage

to
be
cordial
to
her
new
guest




Poor
girl

she


s
devilish
ugly




thought
Anatole


Mademoiselle
Bourienne

also
roused
to
great
excitement
by
Anatole


s
arrival

thought
in
another
way

Of
course

she

a
handsome
young
woman
without
any
definite
position

without
relations
or
even
a
country

did
not
intend
to
devote
her
life
to
serving
Prince
Bolk

nski

to
reading
aloud
to
him
and
being
friends
with
Princess
Mary

Mademoiselle
Bourienne
had
long
been
waiting
for
a
Russian
prince
who

able
to
appreciate
at
a
glance
her
superiority
to
the
plain

badly
dressed

ungainly
Russian
princesses

would
fall
in
love
with
her
and
carry
her
off

and
here
at
last
was
a
Russian
prince

Mademoiselle
Bourienne
knew
a
story

heard
from
her
aunt
but
finished
in
her
own
way

which
she
liked
to
repeat
to
herself

It
was
the
story
of
a
girl
who
had
been
seduced

and
to
whom
her
poor
mother

sa
pauvre
m

re

appeared

and
reproached
her
for
yielding
to
a
man
without
being
married

Mademoiselle
Bourienne
was
often
touched
to
tears
as
in
imagination
she
told
this
story
to
him

her
seducer

And
now
he

a
real
Russian
prince

had
appeared

He
would
carry
her
away
and
then
sa
pauvre
m

re
would
appear
and
he
would
marry
her

So
her
future
shaped
itself
in
Mademoiselle
Bourienne


s
head
at
the
very
time
she
was
talking
to
Anatole
about
Paris

It
was
not
calculation
that
guided
her

she
did
not
even
for
a
moment
consider
what
she
should
do


but
all
this
had
long
been
familiar
to
her

and
now
that
Anatole
had
appeared
it
just
grouped
itself
around
him
and
she
wished
and
tried
to
please
him
as
much
as
possible


The
little
princess

like
an
old
war
horse
that
hears
the
trumpet

unconsciously
and
quite
forgetting
her
condition

prepared
for
the
familiar
gallop
of
coquetry

without
any
ulterior
motive
or
any
struggle

but
with
na

ve
and
lighthearted
gaiety


Although
in
female
society
Anatole
usually
assumed
the
role
of
a
man
tired
of
being
run
after
by
women

his
vanity
was
flattered
by
the
spectacle
of
his
power
over
these
three
women

Besides
that

he
was
beginning
to
feel
for
the
pretty
and
provocative
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
that
passionate
animal
feeling
which
was
apt
to
master
him
with
great
suddenness
and
prompt
him
to
the
coarsest
and
most
reckless
actions


After
tea

the
company
went
into
the
sitting
room
and
Princess
Mary
was
asked
to
play
on
the
clavichord

Anatole

laughing
and
in
high
spirits

came
and
leaned
on
his
elbows

facing
her
and
beside
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

Princess
Mary
felt
his
look
with
a
painfully
joyous
emotion

Her
favorite
sonata
bore
her
into
a
most
intimately
poetic
world
and
the
look
she
felt
upon
her
made
that
world
still
more
poetic

But
Anatole


s
expression

though
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her

referred
not
to
her
but
to
the
movements
of
Mademoiselle
Bourienne


s
little
foot

which
he
was
then
touching
with
his
own
under
the
clavichord

Mademoiselle
Bourienne
was
also
looking
at
Princess
Mary

and
in
her
lovely
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
fearful
joy
and
hope
that
was
also
new
to
the
princess





How
she
loves
me




thought
Princess
Mary




How
happy
I
am
now

and
how
happy
I
may
be
with
such
a
friend
and
such
a
husband

Husband

Can
it
be
possible




she
thought

not
daring
to
look
at
his
face

but
still
feeling
his
eyes
gazing
at
her


In
the
evening

after
supper

when
all
were
about
to
retire

Anatole
kissed
Princess
Mary


s
hand

She
did
not
know
how
she
found
the
courage

but
she
looked
straight
into
his
handsome
face
as
it
came
near
to
her
shortsighted
eyes

Turning
from
Princess
Mary
he
went
up
and
kissed
Mademoiselle
Bourienne


s
hand


This
was
not
etiquette

but
then
he
did
everything
so
simply
and
with
such
assurance


Mademoiselle
Bourienne
flushed

and
gave
the
princess
a
frightened
look





What
delicacy




thought
the
princess




Is
it
possible
that
Am

lie




Mademoiselle
Bourienne




thinks
I
could
be
jealous
of
her

and
not
value
her
pure
affection
and
devotion
to
me




She
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
warmly

Anatole
went
up
to
kiss
the
little
princess



hand





No

No

No

When
your
father
writes
to
tell
me
that
you
are
behaving
well
I
will
give
you
my
hand
to
kiss

Not
till
then




she
said

And
smilingly
raising
a
finger
at
him

she
left
the
room






CHAPTER
V

They
all
separated

but

except
Anatole
who
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
he
got
into
bed

all
kept
awake
a
long
time
that
night





Is
he
really
to
be
my
husband

this
stranger
who
is
so
kind


yes

kind

that
is
the
chief
thing




thought
Princess
Mary

and
fear

which
she
had
seldom
experienced

came
upon
her

She
feared
to
look
round

it
seemed
to
her
that
someone
was
there
standing
behind
the
screen
in
the
dark
corner

And
this
someone
was
he


the
devil


and
he
was
also
this
man
with
the
white
forehead

black
eyebrows

and
red
lips


She
rang
for
her
maid
and
asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
room


Mademoiselle
Bourienne
walked
up
and
down
the
conservatory
for
a
long
time
that
evening

vainly
expecting
someone

now
smiling
at
someone

now
working
herself
up
to
tears
with
the
imaginary
words
of
her
pauvre
m

re
rebuking
her
for
her
fall


The
little
princess
grumbled
to
her
maid
that
her
bed
was
badly
made

She
could
not
lie
either
on
her
face
or
on
her
side

Every
position
was
awkward
and
uncomfortable

and
her
burden
oppressed
her
now
more
than
ever
because
Anatole


s
presence
had
vividly
recalled
to
her
the
time
when
she
was
not
like
that
and
when
everything
was
light
and
gay

She
sat
in
an
armchair
in
her
dressing
jacket
and
nightcap
and
Katie

sleepy
and
disheveled

beat
and
turned
the
heavy
feather
bed
for
the
third
time

muttering
to
herself





I
told
you
it
was
all
lumps
and
holes




the
little
princess
repeated




I
should
be
glad
enough
to
fall
asleep

so
it


s
not
my
fault




and
her
voice
quivered
like
that
of
a
child
about
to
cry


The
old
prince
did
not
sleep
either

T

khon

half
asleep

heard
him
pacing
angrily
about
and
snorting

The
old
prince
felt
as
though
he
had
been
insulted
through
his
daughter

The
insult
was
the
more
pointed
because
it
concerned
not
himself
but
another

his
daughter

whom
he
loved
more
than
himself

He
kept
telling
himself
that
he
would
consider
the
whole
matter
and
decide
what
was
right
and
how
he
should
act

but
instead
of
that
he
only
excited
himself
more
and
more





The
first
man
that
turns
up


she
forgets
her
father
and
everything
else

runs
upstairs
and
does
up
her
hair
and
wags
her
tail
and
is
unlike
herself

Glad
to
throw
her
father
over

And
she
knew
I
should
notice
it

Fr



fr



fr

And
don


t
I
see
that
that
idiot
had
eyes
only
for
Bourienne


I
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
her

And
how
is
it
she
has
not
pride
enough
to
see
it

If
she
has
no
pride
for
herself
she
might
at
least
have
some
for
my
sake

She
must
be
shown
that
the
blockhead
thinks
nothing
of
her
and
looks
only
at
Bourienne

No

she
has
no
pride



but
I


ll
let
her
see








The
old
prince
knew
that
if
he
told
his
daughter
she
was
making
a
mistake
and
that
Anatole
meant
to
flirt
with
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

Princess
Mary


s
self
esteem
would
be
wounded
and
his
point

not
to
be
parted
from
her

would
be
gained

so
pacifying
himself
with
this
thought

he
called
T

khon
and
began
to
undress





What
devil
brought
them
here




thought
he

while
T

khon
was
putting
the
nightshirt
over
his
dried
up
old
body
and
gray
haired
chest




I
never
invited
them

They
came
to
disturb
my
life


and
there
is
not
much
of
it
left








Devil
take



em




he
muttered

while
his
head
was
still
covered
by
the
shirt


T

khon
knew
his
master


s
habit
of
sometimes
thinking
aloud

and
therefore
met
with
unaltered
looks
the
angrily
inquisitive
expression
of
the
face
that
emerged
from
the
shirt





Gone
to
bed




asked
the
prince


T

khon

like
all
good
valets

instinctively
knew
the
direction
of
his
master


s
thoughts

He
guessed
that
the
question
referred
to
Prince
Vas

li
and
his
son





They
have
gone
to
bed
and
put
out
their
lights

your
excellency








No
good



no
good






said
the
prince
rapidly

and
thrusting
his
feet
into
his
slippers
and
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
his
dressing
gown

he
went
to
the
couch
on
which
he
slept


Though
no
words
had
passed
between
Anatole
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne

they
quite
understood
one
another
as
to
the
first
part
of
their
romance

up
to
the
appearance
of
the
pauvre
m

re

they
understood
that
they
had
much
to
say
to
one
another
in
private
and
so
they
had
been
seeking
an
opportunity
since
morning
to
meet
one
another
alone

When
Princess
Mary
went
to
her
father


s
room
at
the
usual
hour

Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
Anatole
met
in
the
conservatory


Princess
Mary
went
to
the
door
of
the
study
with
special
trepidation

It
seemed
to
her
that
not
only
did
everybody
know
that
her
fate
would
be
decided
that
day

but
that
they
also
knew
what
she
thought
about
it

She
read
this
in
T

khon


s
face
and
in
that
of
Prince
Vas

li


s
valet

who
made
her
a
low
bow
when
she
met
him
in
the
corridor
carrying
hot
water


The
old
prince
was
very
affectionate
and
careful
in
his
treatment
of
his
daughter
that
morning

Princess
Mary
well
knew
this
painstaking
expression
of
her
father


s

His
face
wore
that
expression
when
his
dry
hands
clenched
with
vexation
at
her
not
understanding
a
sum
in
arithmetic

when
rising
from
his
chair
he
would
walk
away
from
her

repeating
in
a
low
voice
the
same
words
several
times
over


He
came
to
the
point
at
once

treating
her
ceremoniously





I
have
had
a
proposition
made
me
concerning
you




he
said
with
an
unnatural
smile




I
expect
you
have
guessed
that
Prince
Vas

li
has
not
come
and
brought
his
pupil
with
him




for
some
reason
Prince
Bolk

nski
referred
to
Anatole
as
a



pupil







for
the
sake
of
my
beautiful
eyes

Last
night
a
proposition
was
made
me
on
your
account
and

as
you
know
my
principles

I
refer
it
to
you








How
am
I
to
understand
you

mon
p

re




said
the
princess

growing
pale
and
then
blushing





How
understand
me




cried
her
father
angrily




Prince
Vas

li
finds
you
to
his
taste
as
a
daughter
in
law
and
makes
a
proposal
to
you
on
his
pupil


s
behalf

That


s
how
it


s
to
be
understood




How
understand
it







And
I
ask
you








I
do
not
know
what
you
think

Father




whispered
the
princess





I

I

What
of
me

Leave
me
out
of
the
question

I


m
not
going
to
get
married

What
about
you

That


s
what
I
want
to
know





The
princess
saw
that
her
father
regarded
the
matter
with
disapproval

but
at
that
moment
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
her
fate
would
be
decided
now
or
never

She
lowered
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
gaze
under
which
she
felt
that
she
could
not
think

but
would
only
be
able
to
submit
from
habit

and
she
said




I
wish
only
to
do
your
will

but
if
I
had
to
express
my
own
desire






She
had
no
time
to
finish

The
old
prince
interrupted
her





That


s
admirable




he
shouted




He
will
take
you
with
your
dowry
and
take
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
into
the
bargain

She


ll
be
the
wife

while
you







The
prince
stopped

He
saw
the
effect
these
words
had
produced
on
his
daughter

She
lowered
her
head
and
was
ready
to
burst
into
tears





Now
then

now
then

I


m
only
joking




he
said




Remember
this

Princess

I
hold
to
the
principle
that
a
maiden
has
a
full
right
to
choose

I
give
you
freedom

Only
remember
that
your
life


s
happiness
depends
on
your
decision

Never
mind
me








But
I
do
not
know

Father








There


s
no
need
to
talk

He
receives
his
orders
and
will
marry
you
or
anybody

but
you
are
free
to
choose




Go
to
your
room

think
it
over

and
come
back
in
an
hour
and
tell
me
in
his
presence

yes
or
no

I
know
you
will
pray
over
it

Well

pray
if
you
like

but
you
had
better
think
it
over

Go

Yes
or
no

yes
or
no

yes
or
no




he
still
shouted
when
the
princess

as
if
lost
in
a
fog

had
already
staggered
out
of
the
study


Her
fate
was
decided
and
happily
decided

But
what
her
father
had
said
about
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
was
dreadful

It
was
untrue
to
be
sure

but
still
it
was
terrible

and
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
it

She
was
going
straight
on
through
the
conservatory

neither
seeing
nor
hearing
anything

when
suddenly
the
well
known
whispering
of
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
aroused
her

She
raised
her
eyes

and
two
steps
away
saw
Anatole
embracing
the
Frenchwoman
and
whispering
something
to
her

With
a
horrified
expression
on
his
handsome
face

Anatole
looked
at
Princess
Mary

but
did
not
at
once
take
his
arm
from
the
waist
of
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
who
had
not
yet
seen
her





Who


s
that

Why

Wait
a
moment




Anatole


s
face
seemed
to
say

Princess
Mary
looked
at
them
in
silence

She
could
not
understand
it

At
last
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
gave
a
scream
and
ran
away

Anatole
bowed
to
Princess
Mary
with
a
gay
smile

as
if
inviting
her
to
join
in
a
laugh
at
this
strange
incident

and
then
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
to
the
door
that
led
to
his
own
apartments


An
hour
later

T

khon
came
to
call
Princess
Mary
to
the
old
prince

he
added
that
Prince
Vas

li
was
also
there

When
T

khon
came
to
her
Princess
Mary
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
her
room

holding
the
weeping
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
in
her
arms
and
gently
stroking
her
hair

The
princess



beautiful
eyes
with
all
their
former
calm
radiance
were
looking
with
tender
affection
and
pity
at
Mademoiselle
Bourienne


s
pretty
face





No

Princess

I
have
lost
your
affection
forever




said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne





Why

I
love
you
more
than
ever




said
Princess
Mary




and
I
will
try
to
do
all
I
can
for
your
happiness








But
you
despise
me

You
who
are
so
pure
can
never
understand
being
so
carried
away
by
passion

Oh

only
my
poor
mother










I
quite
understand




answered
Princess
Mary

with
a
sad
smile




Calm
yourself

my
dear

I
will
go
to
my
father




she
said

and
went
out


Prince
Vas

li

with
one
leg
thrown
high
over
the
other
and
a
snuffbox
in
his
hand

was
sitting
there
with
a
smile
of
deep
emotion
on
his
face

as
if
stirred
to
his
heart


s
core
and
himself
regretting
and
laughing
at
his
own
sensibility

when
Princess
Mary
entered

He
hurriedly
took
a
pinch
of
snuff





Ah

my
dear

my
dear




he
began

rising
and
taking
her
by
both
hands

Then

sighing

he
added




My
son


s
fate
is
in
your
hands

Decide

my
dear

good

gentle
Marie

whom
I
have
always
loved
as
a
daughter





He
drew
back
and
a
real
tear
appeared
in
his
eye





Fr

snorted
Prince
Bolk

nski




The
prince
is
making
a
proposition
to
you
in
his
pupil


s


I
mean

his
son


s


name

Do
you
wish
or
not
to
be
Prince
Anatole
Kur

gin


s
wife

Reply

yes
or
no




he
shouted




and
then
I
shall
reserve
the
right
to
state
my
opinion
also

Yes

my
opinion

and
only
my
opinion




added
Prince
Bolk

nski

turning
to
Prince
Vas

li
and
answering
his
imploring
look




Yes

or
no








My
desire
is
never
to
leave
you

Father

never
to
separate
my
life
from
yours

I
don


t
wish
to
marry




she
answered
positively

glancing
at
Prince
Vas

li
and
at
her
father
with
her
beautiful
eyes





Humbug

Nonsense

Humbug

humbug

humbug




cried
Prince
Bolk

nski

frowning
and
taking
his
daughter


s
hand

he
did
not
kiss
her

but
only
bending
his
forehead
to
hers
just
touched
it

and
pressed
her
hand
so
that
she
winced
and
uttered
a
cry


Prince
Vas

li
rose





My
dear

I
must
tell
you
that
this
is
a
moment
I
shall
never

never
forget

But

my
dear

will
you
not
give
us
a
little
hope
of
touching
this
heart

so
kind
and
generous

Say



perhaps






The
future
is
so
long

Say



perhaps











Prince

what
I
have
said
is
all
there
is
in
my
heart

I
thank
you
for
the
honor

but
I
shall
never
be
your
son


s
wife








Well

so
that


s
finished

my
dear
fellow

I
am
very
glad
to
have
seen
you

Very
glad

Go
back
to
your
rooms

Princess

Go




said
the
old
prince




Very

very
glad
to
have
seen
you




repeated
he

embracing
Prince
Vas

li





My
vocation
is
a
different
one




thought
Princess
Mary




My
vocation
is
to
be
happy
with
another
kind
of
happiness

the
happiness
of
love
and
self
sacrifice

And
cost
what
it
may

I
will
arrange
poor
Am

lie


s
happiness

she
loves
him
so
passionately

and
so
passionately
repents

I
will
do
all
I
can
to
arrange
the
match
between
them

If
he
is
not
rich
I
will
give
her
the
means

I
will
ask
my
father
and
Andrew

I
shall
be
so
happy
when
she
is
his
wife

She
is
so
unfortunate

a
stranger

alone

helpless

And

oh
God

how
passionately
she
must
love
him
if
she
could
so
far
forget
herself

Perhaps
I
might
have
done
the
same







thought
Princess
Mary






CHAPTER
VI

It
was
long
since
the
Rost

vs
had
news
of
Nicholas

Not
till
midwinter
was
the
count
at
last
handed
a
letter
addressed
in
his
son


s
handwriting

On
receiving
it

he
ran
on
tiptoe
to
his
study
in
alarm
and
haste

trying
to
escape
notice

closed
the
door

and
began
to
read
the
letter


Anna
Mikh

ylovna

who
always
knew
everything
that
passed
in
the
house

on
hearing
of
the
arrival
of
the
letter
went
softly
into
the
room
and
found
the
count
with
it
in
his
hand

sobbing
and
laughing
at
the
same
time


Anna
Mikh

ylovna

though
her
circumstances
had
improved

was
still
living
with
the
Rost

vs





My
dear
friend




said
she

in
a
tone
of
pathetic
inquiry

prepared
to
sympathize
in
any
way


The
count
sobbed
yet
more

ylovna
sat
down
beside
him

with
her
own
handkerchief
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
from
the
letter

then
having
dried
her
own
eyes
she
comforted
the
count

and
decided
that
at
dinner
and
till
teatime
she
would
prepare
the
countess

and
after
tea

with
God


s
help

would
inform
her


At
dinner
Anna
Mikh

ylovna
talked
the
whole
time
about
the
war
news
and
about
Nik

lenka

twice
asked
when
the
last
letter
had
been
received
from
him

though
she
knew
that
already

and
remarked
that
they
might
very
likely
be
getting
a
letter
from
him
that
day

Each
time
that
these
hints
began
to
make
the
countess
anxious
and
she
glanced
uneasily
at
the
count
and
at
Anna
Mikh

ylovna

the
latter
very
adroitly
turned
the
conversation
to
insignificant
matters

Nat

sha

who

of
the
whole
family

was
the
most
gifted
with
a
capacity
to
feel
any
shades
of
intonation

look

and
expression

pricked
up
her
ears
from
the
beginning
of
the
meal
and
was
certain
that
there
was
some
secret
between
her
father
and
Anna
Mikh

ylovna

that
it
had
something
to
do
with
her
brother

and
that
Anna
Mikh

ylovna
was
preparing
them
for
it

Bold
as
she
was

Nat

sha

who
knew
how
sensitive
her
mother
was
to
anything
relating
to
Nik

lenka

did
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
at
dinner

but
she
was
too
excited
to
eat
anything
and
kept
wriggling
about
on
her
chair
regardless
of
her
governess



remarks

After
dinner

she
rushed
headlong
after
Anna
Mikh

ylovna
and

dashing
at
her

flung
herself
on
her
neck
as
soon
as
she
overtook
her
in
the
sitting
room





Auntie

darling

do
tell
me
what
it
is








Nothing

my
dear








No

dearest

sweet
one

honey

I
won


t
give
up


I
know
you
know
something





Anna
Mikh

ylovna
shook
her
head





You
are
a
little
slyboots




she
said





A
letter
from
Nik

lenka

I


m
sure
of
it




exclaimed
Nat

sha

reading
confirmation
in
Anna
Mikh

ylovna


s
face





But
for
God


s
sake

be
careful

you
know
how
it
may
affect
your
mamma








I
will

I
will

only
tell
me

You
won


t

Then
I
will
go
and
tell
at
once





Anna
Mikh

ylovna

in
a
few
words

told
her
the
contents
of
the
letter

on
condition
that
she
should
tell
no
one





No

on
my
true
word
of
honor




said
Nat

sha

crossing
herself




I
won


t
tell
anyone




and
she
ran
off
at
once
to
S

nya





Nik

lenka



wounded



a
letter




she
announced
in
gleeful
triumph





Nicholas




was
all
S

nya
said

instantly
turning
white


Nat

sha

seeing
the
impression
the
news
of
her
brother


s
wound
produced
on
S

nya

felt
for
the
first
time
the
sorrowful
side
of
the
news


She
rushed
to
S

nya

hugged
her

and
began
to
cry





A
little
wound

but
he
has
been
made
an
officer

he
is
well
now

he
wrote
himself




said
she
through
her
tears





There
now

It


s
true
that
all
you
women
are
crybabies




remarked
P

tya

pacing
the
room
with
large

resolute
strides




Now
I


m
very
glad

very
glad
indeed

that
my
brother
has
distinguished
himself
so

You
are
all
blubberers
and
understand
nothing





Nat

sha
smiled
through
her
tears





You
haven


t
read
the
letter




asked
S

nya





No

but
she
said
that
it
was
all
over
and
that
he


s
now
an
officer








Thank
God




said
S

nya

crossing
herself




But
perhaps
she
deceived
you

Let
us
go
to
Mamma





P

tya
paced
the
room
in
silence
for
a
time





If
I


d
been
in
Nik

lenka


s
place
I
would
have
killed
even
more
of
those
Frenchmen




he
said




What
nasty
brutes
they
are

I


d
have
killed
so
many
that
there


d
have
been
a
heap
of
them








Hold
your
tongue

P

tya

what
a
goose
you
are








I


m
not
a
goose

but
they
are
who
cry
about
trifles




said
P

tya





Do
you
remember
him




Nat

sha
suddenly
asked

after
a
moment


s
silence


S

nya
smiled





Do
I
remember
Nicholas








No

S

nya

but
do
you
remember
so
that
you
remember
him
perfectly

remember
everything




said
Nat

sha

with
an
expressive
gesture

evidently
wishing
to
give
her
words
a
very
definite
meaning




I
remember
Nik

lenka
too

I
remember
him
well




she
said




But
I
don


t
remember
Bor

s

I
don


t
remember
him
a
bit








What

You
don


t
remember
Bor

s




asked
S

nya
in
surprise





It


s
not
that
I
don


t
remember


I
know
what
he
is
like

but
not
as
I
remember
Nik

lenka

Him


I
just
shut
my
eyes
and
remember

but
Bor

s



No





She
shut
her
eyes





No

there


s
nothing
at
all








Oh

Nat

sha




said
S

nya

looking
ecstatically
and
earnestly
at
her
friend
as
if
she
did
not
consider
her
worthy
to
hear
what
she
meant
to
say
and
as
if
she
were
saying
it
to
someone
else

with
whom
joking
was
out
of
the
question




I
am
in
love
with
your
brother
once
for
all
and

whatever
may
happen
to
him
or
to
me

shall
never
cease
to
love
him
as
long
as
I
live





Nat

sha
looked
at
S

nya
with
wondering
and
inquisitive
eyes

and
said
nothing

She
felt
that
S

nya
was
speaking
the
truth

that
there
was
such
love
as
S

nya
was
speaking
of

But
Nat

sha
had
not
yet
felt
anything
like
it

She
believed
it
could
be

but
did
not
understand
it





Shall
you
write
to
him




she
asked


S

nya
became
thoughtful

The
question
of
how
to
write
to
Nicholas

and
whether
she
ought
to
write

tormented
her

Now
that
he
was
already
an
officer
and
a
wounded
hero

would
it
be
right
to
remind
him
of
herself
and

as
it
might
seem

of
the
obligations
to
her
he
had
taken
on
himself





I
don


t
know

I
think
if
he
writes

I
will
write
too




she
said

blushing





And
you
won


t
feel
ashamed
to
write
to
him





S

nya
smiled





No








And
I
should
be
ashamed
to
write
to
Bor

s

I


m
not
going
to








Why
should
you
be
ashamed








Well

I
don


t
know

It


s
awkward
and
would
make
me
ashamed








And
I
know
why
she


d
be
ashamed




said
P

tya

offended
by
Nat

sha


s
previous
remark




It


s
because
she
was
in
love
with
that
fat
one
in
spectacles




that
was
how
P

tya
described
his
namesake

the
new
Count
Bez

khov




and
now
she


s
in
love
with
that
singer




he
meant
Nat

sha


s
Italian
singing
master





that


s
why
she


s
ashamed








P

tya

you


re
a
stupid




said
Nat

sha





Not
more
stupid
than
you

madam




said
the
nine
year
old
P

tya

with
the
air
of
an
old
brigadier


The
countess
had
been
prepared
by
Anna
Mikh

ylovna


s
hints
at
dinner

On
retiring
to
her
own
room

she
sat
in
an
armchair

her
eyes
fixed
on
a
miniature
portrait
of
her
son
on
the
lid
of
a
snuffbox

while
the
tears
kept
coming
into
her
eyes

Anna
Mikh

ylovna

with
the
letter

came
on
tiptoe
to
the
countess



door
and
paused





Don


t
come
in




she
said
to
the
old
count
who
was
following
her




Come
later




And
she
went
in

closing
the
door
behind
her


The
count
put
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
listened


At
first
he
heard
the
sound
of
indifferent
voices

then
Anna
Mikh

ylovna


s
voice
alone
in
a
long
speech

then
a
cry

then
silence

then
both
voices
together
with
glad
intonations

and
then
footsteps

Anna
Mikh

ylovna
opened
the
door

Her
face
wore
the
proud
expression
of
a
surgeon
who
has
just
performed
a
difficult
operation
and
admits
the
public
to
appreciate
his
skill





It
is
done




she
said
to
the
count

pointing
triumphantly
to
the
countess

who
sat
holding
in
one
hand
the
snuffbox
with
its
portrait
and
in
the
other
the
letter

and
pressing
them
alternately
to
her
lips


When
she
saw
the
count

she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him

embraced
his
bald
head

over
which
she
again
looked
at
the
letter
and
the
portrait

and
in
order
to
press
them
again
to
her
lips

she
slightly
pushed
away
the
bald
head

V

ra

Nat

sha

S

nya

and
P

tya
now
entered
the
room

and
the
reading
of
the
letter
began

After
a
brief
description
of
the
campaign
and
the
two
battles
in
which
he
had
taken
part

and
his
promotion

Nicholas
said
that
he
kissed
his
father


s
and
mother


s
hands
asking
for
their
blessing

and
that
he
kissed
V

ra

Nat

sha

and
P

tya

Besides
that

he
sent
greetings
to
Monsieur
Schelling

Madame
Schoss

and
his
old
nurse

and
asked
them
to
kiss
for
him



dear
S

nya

whom
he
loved
and
thought
of
just
the
same
as
ever




When
she
heard
this
S

nya
blushed
so
that
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and

unable
to
bear
the
looks
turned
upon
her

ran
away
into
the
dancing
hall

whirled
round
it
at
full
speed
with
her
dress
puffed
out
like
a
balloon

and

flushed
and
smiling

plumped
down
on
the
floor

The
countess
was
crying





Why
are
you
crying

Mamma




asked
V

ra




From
all
he
says
one
should
be
glad
and
not
cry





This
was
quite
true

but
the
count

the
countess

and
Nat

sha
looked
at
her
reproachfully




And
who
is
it
she
takes
after




thought
the
countess


Nicholas



letter
was
read
over
hundreds
of
times

and
those
who
were
considered
worthy
to
hear
it
had
to
come
to
the
countess

for
she
did
not
let
it
out
of
her
hands

The
tutors
came

and
the
nurses

and
Dm

tri

and
several
acquaintances

and
the
countess
reread
the
letter
each
time
with
fresh
pleasure
and
each
time
discovered
in
it
fresh
proofs
of
Nik

lenka


s
virtues

How
strange

how
extraordinary

how
joyful
it
seemed

that
her
son

the
scarcely
perceptible
motion
of
whose
tiny
limbs
she
had
felt
twenty
years
ago
within
her

that
son
about
whom
she
used
to
have
quarrels
with
the
too
indulgent
count

that
son
who
had
first
learned
to
say



pear



and
then



granny




that
this
son
should
now
be
away
in
a
foreign
land
amid
strange
surroundings

a
manly
warrior
doing
some
kind
of
man


s
work
of
his
own

without
help
or
guidance

The
universal
experience
of
ages

showing
that
children
do
grow
imperceptibly
from
the
cradle
to
manhood

did
not
exist
for
the
countess

Her
son


s
growth
toward
manhood

at
each
of
its
stages

had
seemed
as
extraordinary
to
her
as
if
there
had
never
existed
the
millions
of
human
beings
who
grew
up
in
the
same
way

As
twenty
years
before

it
seemed
impossible
that
the
little
creature
who
lived
somewhere
under
her
heart
would
ever
cry

suck
her
breast

and
begin
to
speak

so
now
she
could
not
believe
that
that
little
creature
could
be
this
strong

brave
man

this
model
son
and
officer
that

judging
by
this
letter

he
now
was





What
a
style

How
charmingly
he
describes




said
she

reading
the
descriptive
part
of
the
letter




And
what
a
soul

Not
a
word
about
himself




Not
a
word

About
some
Den

sov
or
other

though
he
himself

I
dare
say

is
braver
than
any
of
them

He
says
nothing
about
his
sufferings

What
a
heart

How
like
him
it
is

And
how
he
has
remembered
everybody

Not
forgetting
anyone

I
always
said
when
he
was
only
so
high


I
always
said








For
more
than
a
week
preparations
were
being
made

rough
drafts
of
letters
to
Nicholas
from
all
the
household
were
written
and
copied
out

while
under
the
supervision
of
the
countess
and
the
solicitude
of
the
count

money
and
all
things
necessary
for
the
uniform
and
equipment
of
the
newly
commissioned
officer
were
collected

Anna
Mikh

ylovna

practical
woman
that
she
was

had
even
managed
by
favor
with
army
authorities
to
secure
advantageous
means
of
communication
for
herself
and
her
son

She
had
opportunities
of
sending
her
letters
to
the
Grand
Duke
Constantine
P

vlovich

who
commanded
the
Guards

The
Rost

vs
supposed
that
The
Russian
Guards

Abroad

was
quite
a
definite
address

and
that
if
a
letter
reached
the
Grand
Duke
in
command
of
the
Guards
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
not
reach
the
P

vlograd
regiment

which
was
presumably
somewhere
in
the
same
neighborhood

And
so
it
was
decided
to
send
the
letters
and
money
by
the
Grand
Duke


s
courier
to
Bor

s
and
Bor

s
was
to
forward
them
to
Nicholas

The
letters
were
from
the
old
count

the
countess

P

tya

V

ra

Nat

sha

and
S

nya

and
finally
there
were
six
thousand
rubles
for
his
outfit
and
various
other
things
the
old
count
sent
to
his
son






CHAPTER
VII

On
the
twelfth
of
November

Kut

zov


s
active
army

in
camp
before
Olm

tz

was
preparing
to
be
reviewed
next
day
by
the
two
Emperors


the
Russian
and
the
Austrian

The
Guards

just
arrived
from
Russia

spent
the
night
ten
miles
from
Olm

tz
and
next
morning
were
to
come
straight
to
the
review

reaching
the
field
at
Olm

tz
by
ten
o


clock


That
day
Nicholas
Rost

v
received
a
letter
from
Bor

s

telling
him
that
the
Ism

ylov
regiment
was
quartered
for
the
night
ten
miles
from
Olm

tz
and
that
he
wanted
to
see
him
as
he
had
a
letter
and
money
for
him

Rost

v
was
particularly
in
need
of
money
now
that
the
troops

after
their
active
service

were
stationed
near
Olm

tz
and
the
camp
swarmed
with
well
provisioned
sutlers
and
Austrian
Jews
offering
all
sorts
of
tempting
wares

The
P

vlograds
held
feast
after
feast

celebrating
awards
they
had
received
for
the
campaign

and
made
expeditions
to
Olm

tz
to
visit
a
certain
Caroline
the
Hungarian

who
had
recently
opened
a
restaurant
there
with
girls
as
waitresses

Rost

v

who
had
just
celebrated
his
promotion
to
a
cornetcy
and
bought
Den

sov


s
horse

Bedouin

was
in
debt
all
round

to
his
comrades
and
the
sutlers

On
receiving
Bor

s



letter
he
rode
with
a
fellow
officer
to
Olm

tz

dined
there

drank
a
bottle
of
wine

and
then
set
off
alone
to
the
Guards



camp
to
find
his
old
playmate

Rost

v
had
not
yet
had
time
to
get
his
uniform

He
had
on
a
shabby
cadet
jacket

decorated
with
a
soldier


s
cross

equally
shabby
cadet


s
riding
breeches
lined
with
worn
leather

and
an
officer


s
saber
with
a
sword
knot

The
Don
horse
he
was
riding
was
one
he
had
bought
from
a
Cossack
during
the
campaign

and
he
wore
a
crumpled
hussar
cap
stuck
jauntily
back
on
one
side
of
his
head

As
he
rode
up
to
the
camp
he
thought
how
he
would
impress
Bor

s
and
all
his
comrades
of
the
Guards
by
his
appearance


that
of
a
fighting
hussar
who
had
been
under
fire


The
Guards
had
made
their
whole
march
as
if
on
a
pleasure
trip

parading
their
cleanliness
and
discipline

They
had
come
by
easy
stages

their
knapsacks
conveyed
on
carts

and
the
Austrian
authorities
had
provided
excellent
dinners
for
the
officers
at
every
halting
place

The
regiments
had
entered
and
left
the
town
with
their
bands
playing

and
by
the
Grand
Duke


s
orders
the
men
had
marched
all
the
way
in
step

a
practice
on
which
the
Guards
prided
themselves


the
officers
on
foot
and
at
their
proper
posts

Bor

s
had
been
quartered

and
had
marched
all
the
way

with
Berg
who
was
already
in
command
of
a
company

Berg

who
had
obtained
his
captaincy
during
the
campaign

had
gained
the
confidence
of
his
superiors
by
his
promptitude
and
accuracy
and
had
arranged
his
money
matters
very
satisfactorily

Bor

s

during
the
campaign

had
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
persons
who
might
prove
useful
to
him

and
by
a
letter
of
recommendation
he
had
brought
from
Pierre
had
become
acquainted
with
Prince
Andrew
Bolk

nski

through
whom
he
hoped
to
obtain
a
post
on
the
commander
in
chief


s
staff

Berg
and
Bor

s

having
rested
after
yesterday


s
march

were
sitting

clean
and
neatly
dressed

at
a
round
table
in
the
clean
quarters
allotted
to
them

playing
chess

Berg
held
a
smoking
pipe
between
his
knees

Bor

s

in
the
accurate
way
characteristic
of
him

was
building
a
little
pyramid
of
chessmen
with
his
delicate
white
fingers
while
awaiting
Berg


s
move

and
watched
his
opponent


s
face

evidently
thinking
about
the
game
as
he
always
thought
only
of
whatever
he
was
engaged
on





Well

how
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
that




he
remarked





We


ll
try
to




replied
Berg

touching
a
pawn
and
then
removing
his
hand


At
that
moment
the
door
opened





Here
he
is
at
last




shouted
Rost

v




And
Berg
too

Oh

you
petisenfans

allay
cushay
dormir




he
exclaimed

imitating
his
Russian
nurse


s
French

at
which
he
and
Bor

s
used
to
laugh
long
ago





Dear
me

how
you
have
changed





Bor

s
rose
to
meet
Rost

v

but
in
doing
so
did
not
omit
to
steady
and
replace
some
chessmen
that
were
falling

He
was
about
to
embrace
his
friend

but
Nicholas
avoided
him

With
that
peculiar
feeling
of
youth

that
dread
of
beaten
tracks

and
wish
to
express
itself
in
a
manner
different
from
that
of
its
elders
which
is
often
insincere

Nicholas
wished
to
do
something
special
on
meeting
his
friend

He
wanted
to
pinch
him

push
him

do
anything
but
kiss
him


a
thing
everybody
did

But
notwithstanding
this

Bor

s
embraced
him
in
a
quiet

friendly
way
and
kissed
him
three
times


They
had
not
met
for
nearly
half
a
year
and

being
at
the
age
when
young
men
take
their
first
steps
on
life


s
road

each
saw
immense
changes
in
the
other

quite
a
new
reflection
of
the
society
in
which
they
had
taken
those
first
steps

Both
had
changed
greatly
since
they
last
met
and
both
were
in
a
hurry
to
show
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
them





Oh

you
damned
dandies

Clean
and
fresh
as
if
you


d
been
to
a
fete

not
like
us
sinners
of
the
line




cried
Rost

v

with
martial
swagger
and
with
baritone
notes
in
his
voice

new
to
Bor

s

pointing
to
his
own
mud
bespattered
breeches

The
German
landlady

hearing
Rost

v


s
loud
voice

popped
her
head
in
at
the
door





Eh

is
she
pretty




he
asked
with
a
wink





Why
do
you
shout
so

You


ll
frighten
them




said
Bor

s




I
did
not
expect
you
today




he
added




I
only
sent
you
the
note
yesterday
by
Bolk

nski


an
adjutant
of
Kut

zov


s

who


s
a
friend
of
mine

I
did
not
think
he
would
get
it
to
you
so
quickly




Well

how
are
you

Been
under
fire
already




asked
Bor

s


Without
answering

Rost

v
shook
the
soldier


s
Cross
of
St

George
fastened
to
the
cording
of
his
uniform
and

indicating
a
bandaged
arm

glanced
at
Berg
with
a
smile





As
you
see




he
said





Indeed

Yes

yes




said
Bor

s

with
a
smile




And
we
too
have
had
a
splendid
march

You
know

of
course

that
His
Imperial
Highness
rode
with
our
regiment
all
the
time

so
that
we
had
every
comfort
and
every
advantage

What
receptions
we
had
in
Poland

What
dinners
and
balls

I
can


t
tell
you

And
the
Tsar

vich
was
very
gracious
to
all
our
officers





And
the
two
friends
told
each
other
of
their
doings

the
one
of
his
hussar
revels
and
life
in
the
fighting
line

the
other
of
the
pleasures
and
advantages
of
service
under
members
of
the
Imperial
family





Oh

you
Guards




said
Rost

v




I
say

send
for
some
wine





Bor

s
made
a
grimace





If
you
really
want
it




said
he


He
went
to
his
bed

drew
a
purse
from
under
the
clean
pillow

and
sent
for
wine





Yes

and
I
have
some
money
and
a
letter
to
give
you




he
added


Rost

v
took
the
letter
and

throwing
the
money
on
the
sofa

put
both
arms
on
the
table
and
began
to
read

After
reading
a
few
lines

he
glanced
angrily
at
Berg

then

meeting
his
eyes

hid
his
face
behind
the
letter





Well

they


ve
sent
you
a
tidy
sum




said
Berg

eying
the
heavy
purse
that
sank
into
the
sofa




As
for
us

Count

we
get
along
on
our
pay

I
can
tell
you
for
myself










I
say

Berg

my
dear
fellow




said
Rost

v




when
you
get
a
letter
from
home
and
meet
one
of
your
own
people
whom
you
want
to
talk
everything
over
with

and
I
happen
to
be
there

I


ll
go
at
once

to
be
out
of
your
way

Do
go
somewhere

anywhere



to
the
devil




he
exclaimed

and
immediately
seizing
him
by
the
shoulder
and
looking
amiably
into
his
face

evidently
wishing
to
soften
the
rudeness
of
his
words

he
added




Don


t
be
hurt

my
dear
fellow

you
know
I
speak
from
my
heart
as
to
an
old
acquaintance








Oh

don


t
mention
it

Count

I
quite
understand




said
Berg

getting
up
and
speaking
in
a
muffled
and
guttural
voice





Go
across
to
our
hosts

they
invited
you




added
Bor

s


Berg
put
on
the
cleanest
of
coats

without
a
spot
or
speck
of
dust

stood
before
a
looking
glass
and
brushed
the
hair
on
his
temples
upwards

in
the
way
affected
by
the
Emperor
Alexander

and

having
assured
himself
from
the
way
Rost

v
looked
at
it
that
his
coat
had
been
noticed

left
the
room
with
a
pleasant
smile





Oh
dear

what
a
beast
I
am




muttered
Rost

v

as
he
read
the
letter





Why








Oh

what
a
pig
I
am

not
to
have
written
and
to
have
given
them
such
a
fright

Oh

what
a
pig
I
am




he
repeated

flushing
suddenly




Well

have
you
sent
Gabriel
for
some
wine

All
right
let


s
have
some





In
the
letter
from
his
parents
was
enclosed
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
Bagrati

n
which
the
old
countess
at
Anna
Mikh

ylovna


s
advice
had
obtained
through
an
acquaintance
and
sent
to
her
son

asking
him
to
take
it
to
its
destination
and
make
use
of
it





What
nonsense

Much
I
need
it




said
Rost

v

throwing
the
letter
under
the
table





Why
have
you
thrown
that
away




asked
Bor

s





It
is
some
letter
of
recommendation



what
the
devil
do
I
want
it
for








Why



What
the
devil







said
Bor

s

picking
it
up
and
reading
the
address




This
letter
would
be
of
great
use
to
you








I
want
nothing

and
I
won


t
be
anyone


s
adjutant








Why
not




inquired
Bor

s





It


s
a
lackey


s
job








You
are
still
the
same
dreamer

I
see




remarked
Bor

s

shaking
his
head





And
you


re
still
the
same
diplomatist

But
that


s
not
the
point



Come

how
are
you




asked
Rost

v





Well

as
you
see

So
far
everything


s
all
right

but
I
confess
I
should
much
like
to
be
an
adjutant
and
not
remain
at
the
front








Why








Because
when
once
a
man
starts
on
military
service

he
should
try
to
make
as
successful
a
career
of
it
as
possible








Oh

that


s
it




said
Rost

v

evidently
thinking
of
something
else


He
looked
intently
and
inquiringly
into
his
friend


s
eyes

evidently
trying
in
vain
to
find
the
answer
to
some
question


Old
Gabriel
brought
in
the
wine





Shouldn


t
we
now
send
for
Berg




asked
Bor

s




He
would
drink
with
you

I
can


t








Well

send
for
him



and
how
do
you
get
on
with
that
German




asked
Rost

v

with
a
contemptuous
smile





He
is
a
very

very
nice

honest

and
pleasant
fellow




answered
Bor

s


Again
Rost

v
looked
intently
into
Bor

s



eyes
and
sighed

Berg
returned

and
over
the
bottle
of
wine
conversation
between
the
three
officers
became
animated

The
Guardsmen
told
Rost

v
of
their
march
and
how
they
had
been
made
much
of
in
Russia

Poland

and
abroad

They
spoke
of
the
sayings
and
doings
of
their
commander

the
Grand
Duke

and
told
stories
of
his
kindness
and
irascibility

Berg

as
usual

kept
silent
when
the
subject
did
not
relate
to
himself

but
in
connection
with
the
stories
of
the
Grand
Duke


s
quick
temper
he
related
with
gusto
how
in
Galicia
he
had
managed
to
deal
with
the
Grand
Duke
when
the
latter
made
a
tour
of
the
regiments
and
was
annoyed
at
the
irregularity
of
a
movement

With
a
pleasant
smile
Berg
related
how
the
Grand
Duke
had
ridden
up
to
him
in
a
violent
passion

shouting




Arnauts








Arnauts



was
the
Tsar

vich


s
favorite
expression
when
he
was
in
a
rage

and
called
for
the
company
commander





Would
you
believe
it

Count

I
was
not
at
all
alarmed

because
I
knew
I
was
right

Without
boasting

you
know

I
may
say
that
I
know
the
Army
Orders
by
heart
and
know
the
Regulations
as
well
as
I
do
the
Lord


s
Prayer

So

Count

there
never
is
any
negligence
in
my
company

and
so
my
conscience
was
at
ease

I
came
forward








Berg
stood
up
and
showed
how
he
presented
himself

with
his
hand
to
his
cap

and
really
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
a
face
to
express
greater
respect
and
self
complacency
than
his
did





Well

he
stormed
at
me

as
the
saying
is

stormed
and
stormed
and
stormed

It
was
not
a
matter
of
life
but
rather
of
death

as
the
saying
is




Albanians




and



devils




and



To
Siberia







said
Berg
with
a
sagacious
smile




I
knew
I
was
in
the
right
so
I
kept
silent

was
not
that
best

Count







Hey

are
you
dumb




he
shouted

Still
I
remained
silent

And
what
do
you
think

Count

The
next
day
it
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the
Orders
of
the
Day

That


s
what
keeping
one


s
head
means

That


s
the
way

Count




said
Berg

lighting
his
pipe
and
emitting
rings
of
smoke





Yes

that
was
fine




said
Rost

v

smiling


But
Bor

s
noticed
that
he
was
preparing
to
make
fun
of
Berg

and
skillfully
changed
the
subject

He
asked
him
to
tell
them
how
and
where
he
got
his
wound

This
pleased
Rost

v
and
he
began
talking
about
it

and
as
he
went
on
became
more
and
more
animated

He
told
them
of
his
Sch

n
Grabern
affair

just
as
those
who
have
taken
part
in
a
battle
generally
do
describe
it

that
is

as
they
would
like
it
to
have
been

as
they
have
heard
it
described
by
others

and
as
sounds
well

but
not
at
all
as
it
really
was

Rost

v
was
a
truthful
young
man
and
would
on
no
account
have
told
a
deliberate
lie

He
began
his
story
meaning
to
tell
everything
just
as
it
happened

but
imperceptibly

involuntarily

and
inevitably
he
lapsed
into
falsehood

If
he
had
told
the
truth
to
his
hearers


who
like
himself
had
often
heard
stories
of
attacks
and
had
formed
a
definite
idea
of
what
an
attack
was
and
were
expecting
to
hear
just
such
a
story


they
would
either
not
have
believed
him
or

still
worse

would
have
thought
that
Rost

v
was
himself
to
blame
since
what
generally
happens
to
the
narrators
of
cavalry
attacks
had
not
happened
to
him

He
could
not
tell
them
simply
that
everyone
went
at
a
trot
and
that
he
fell
off
his
horse
and
sprained
his
arm
and
then
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
from
a
Frenchman
into
the
wood

Besides

to
tell
everything
as
it
really
happened

it
would
have
been
necessary
to
make
an
effort
of
will
to
tell
only
what
happened

It
is
very
difficult
to
tell
the
truth

and
young
people
are
rarely
capable
of
it

His
hearers
expected
a
story
of
how
beside
himself
and
all
aflame
with
excitement

he
had
flown
like
a
storm
at
the
square

cut
his
way
in

slashed
right
and
left

how
his
saber
had
tasted
flesh
and
he
had
fallen
exhausted

and
so
on

And
so
he
told
them
all
that


In
the
middle
of
his
story

just
as
he
was
saying




You
cannot
imagine
what
a
strange
frenzy
one
experiences
during
an
attack




Prince
Andrew

whom
Bor

s
was
expecting

entered
the
room

Prince
Andrew

who
liked
to
help
young
men

was
flattered
by
being
asked
for
his
assistance
and
being
well
disposed
toward
Bor

s

who
had
managed
to
please
him
the
day
before

he
wished
to
do
what
the
young
man
wanted

Having
been
sent
with
papers
from
Kut

zov
to
the
Tsar

vich

he
looked
in
on
Bor

s

hoping
to
find
him
alone

When
he
came
in
and
saw
an
hussar
of
the
line
recounting
his
military
exploits

Prince
Andrew
could
not
endure
that
sort
of
man


he
gave
Bor

s
a
pleasant
smile

frowned
as
with
half
closed
eyes
he
looked
at
Rost

v

bowed
slightly
and
wearily

and
sat
down
languidly
on
the
sofa

he
felt
it
unpleasant
to
have
dropped
in
on
bad
company

Rost

v
flushed
up
on
noticing
this

but
he
did
not
care

this
was
a
mere
stranger

Glancing

however

at
Bor

s

he
saw
that
he
too
seemed
ashamed
of
the
hussar
of
the
line


In
spite
of
Prince
Andrew


s
disagreeable

ironical
tone

in
spite
of
the
contempt
with
which
Rost

v

from
his
fighting
army
point
of
view

regarded
all
these
little
adjutants
on
the
staff
of
whom
the
newcomer
was
evidently
one

Rost

v
felt
confused

blushed

and
became
silent

Bor

s
inquired
what
news
there
might
be
on
the
staff

and
what

without
indiscretion

one
might
ask
about
our
plans





We
shall
probably
advance




replied
Bolk

nski

evidently
reluctant
to
say
more
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger


Berg
took
the
opportunity
to
ask

with
great
politeness

whether

as
was
rumored

the
allowance
of
forage
money
to
captains
of
companies
would
be
doubled

To
this
Prince
Andrew
answered
with
a
smile
that
he
could
give
no
opinion
on
such
an
important
government
order

and
Berg
laughed
gaily





As
to
your
business




Prince
Andrew
continued

addressing
Bor

s




we
will
talk
of
it
later




and
he
looked
round
at
Rost

v





Come
to
me
after
the
review
and
we
will
do
what
is
possible





And

having
glanced
round
the
room

Prince
Andrew
turned
to
Rost

v

whose
state
of
unconquerable
childish
embarrassment
now
changing
to
anger
he
did
not
condescend
to
notice

and
said




I
think
you
were
talking
of
the
Sch

n
Grabern
affair

Were
you
there








I
was
there




said
Rost

v
angrily

as
if
intending
to
insult
the
aide
de
camp


Bolk

nski
noticed
the
hussar


s
state
of
mind

and
it
amused
him

With
a
slightly
contemptuous
smile

he
said




Yes

there
are
many
stories
now
told
about
that
affair








Yes

stories




repeated
Rost

v
loudly

looking
with
eyes
suddenly
grown
furious

now
at
Bor

s

now
at
Bolk

nski




Yes

many
stories

But
our
stories
are
the
stories
of
men
who
have
been
under
the
enemy


s
fire

Our
stories
have
some
weight

not
like
the
stories
of
those
fellows
on
the
staff
who
get
rewards
without
doing
anything








Of
whom
you
imagine
me
to
be
one




said
Prince
Andrew

with
a
quiet
and
particularly
amiable
smile


A
strange
feeling
of
exasperation
and
yet
of
respect
for
this
man


s
self
possession
mingled
at
that
moment
in
Rost

v


s
soul





I
am
not
talking
about
you




he
said




I
don


t
know
you
and

frankly

I
don


t
want
to

I
am
speaking
of
the
staff
in
general








And
I
will
tell
you
this




Prince
Andrew
interrupted
in
a
tone
of
quiet
authority




you
wish
to
insult
me

and
I
am
ready
to
agree
with
you
that
it
would
be
very
easy
to
do
so
if
you
haven


t
sufficient
self
respect

but
admit
that
the
time
and
place
are
very
badly
chosen

In
a
day
or
two
we
shall
all
have
to
take
part
in
a
greater
and
more
serious
duel

and
besides

Drubetsk

y

who
says
he
is
an
old
friend
of
yours

is
not
at
all
to
blame
that
my
face
has
the
misfortune
to
displease
you

However




he
added
rising




you
know
my
name
and
where
to
find
me

but
don


t
forget
that
I
do
not
regard
either
myself
or
you
as
having
been
at
all
insulted

and
as
a
man
older
than
you

my
advice
is
to
let
the
matter
drop

Well
then

on
Friday
after
the
review
I
shall
expect
you

Drubetsk

y

Au
revoir




exclaimed
Prince
Andrew

and
with
a
bow
to
them
both
he
went
out


Only
when
Prince
Andrew
was
gone
did
Rost

v
think
of
what
he
ought
to
have
said

And
he
was
still
more
angry
at
having
omitted
to
say
it

He
ordered
his
horse
at
once
and

coldly
taking
leave
of
Bor

s

rode
home

Should
he
go
to
headquarters
next
day
and
challenge
that
affected
adjutant

or
really
let
the
matter
drop

was
the
question
that
worried
him
all
the
way

He
thought
angrily
of
the
pleasure
he
would
have
at
seeing
the
fright
of
that
small
and
frail
but
proud
man
when
covered
by
his
pistol

and
then
he
felt
with
surprise
that
of
all
the
men
he
knew
there
was
none
he
would
so
much
like
to
have
for
a
friend
as
that
very
adjutant
whom
he
so
hated






CHAPTER
VIII

The
day
after
Rost

v
had
been
to
see
Bor

s

a
review
was
held
of
the
Austrian
and
Russian
troops

both
those
freshly
arrived
from
Russia
and
those
who
had
been
campaigning
under
Kut

zov

The
two
Emperors

the
Russian
with
his
heir
the
Tsar

vich

and
the
Austrian
with
the
Archduke

inspected
the
allied
army
of
eighty
thousand
men


From
early
morning
the
smart
clean
troops
were
on
the
move

forming
up
on
the
field
before
the
fortress

Now
thousands
of
feet
and
bayonets
moved
and
halted
at
the
officers



command

turned
with
banners
flying

formed
up
at
intervals

and
wheeled
round
other
similar
masses
of
infantry
in
different
uniforms

now
was
heard
the
rhythmic
beat
of
hoofs
and
the
jingling
of
showy
cavalry
in
blue

red

and
green
braided
uniforms

with
smartly
dressed
bandsmen
in
front
mounted
on
black

roan

or
gray
horses

then
again

spreading
out
with
the
brazen
clatter
of
the
polished
shining
cannon
that
quivered
on
the
gun
carriages
and
with
the
smell
of
linstocks

came
the
artillery
which
crawled
between
the
infantry
and
cavalry
and
took
up
its
appointed
position

Not
only
the
generals
in
full
parade
uniforms

with
their
thin
or
thick
waists
drawn
in
to
the
utmost

their
red
necks
squeezed
into
their
stiff
collars

and
wearing
scarves
and
all
their
decorations

not
only
the
elegant

pomaded
officers

but
every
soldier
with
his
freshly
washed
and
shaven
face
and
his
weapons
clean
and
polished
to
the
utmost

and
every
horse
groomed
till
its
coat
shone
like
satin
and
every
hair
of
its
wetted
mane
lay
smooth


felt
that
no
small
matter
was
happening

but
an
important
and
solemn
affair

Every
general
and
every
soldier
was
conscious
of
his
own
insignificance

aware
of
being
but
a
drop
in
that
ocean
of
men

and
yet
at
the
same
time
was
conscious
of
his
strength
as
a
part
of
that
enormous
whole


From
early
morning
strenuous
activities
and
efforts
had
begun
and
by
ten
o


clock
all
had
been
brought
into
due
order

The
ranks
were
drawn
up
on
the
vast
field

The
whole
army
was
extended
in
three
lines

the
cavalry
in
front

behind
it
the
artillery

and
behind
that
again
the
infantry


A
space
like
a
street
was
left
between
each
two
lines
of
troops

The
three
parts
of
that
army
were
sharply
distinguished

Kut

zov


s
fighting
army

with
the
P

vlograds
on
the
right
flank
of
the
front


those
recently
arrived
from
Russia

both
Guards
and
regiments
of
the
line

and
the
Austrian
troops

But
they
all
stood
in
the
same
lines

under
one
command

and
in
a
like
order


Like
wind
over
leaves
ran
an
excited
whisper




They


re
coming

They


re
coming




Alarmed
voices
were
heard

and
a
stir
of
final
preparation
swept
over
all
the
troops


From
the
direction
of
Olm

tz
in
front
of
them

a
group
was
seen
approaching

And
at
that
moment

though
the
day
was
still

a
light
gust
of
wind
blowing
over
the
army
slightly
stirred
the
streamers
on
the
lances
and
the
unfolded
standards
fluttered
against
their
staffs

It
looked
as
if
by
that
slight
motion
the
army
itself
was
expressing
its
joy
at
the
approach
of
the
Emperors

One
voice
was
heard
shouting




Eyes
front




Then

like
the
crowing
of
cocks
at
sunrise

this
was
repeated
by
others
from
various
sides
and
all
became
silent


In
the
deathlike
stillness
only
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard

This
was
the
Emperors



suites

The
Emperors
rode
up
to
the
flank

and
the
trumpets
of
the
first
cavalry
regiment
played
the
general
march

It
seemed
as
though
not
the
trumpeters
were
playing

but
as
if
the
army
itself

rejoicing
at
the
Emperors



approach

had
naturally
burst
into
music

Amid
these
sounds

only
the
youthful
kindly
voice
of
the
Emperor
Alexander
was
clearly
heard

He
gave
the
words
of
greeting

and
the
first
regiment
roared



Hurrah




so
deafeningly

continuously

and
joyfully
that
the
men
themselves
were
awed
by
their
multitude
and
the
immensity
of
the
power
they
constituted


Rost

v

standing
in
the
front
lines
of
Kut

zov


s
army
which
the
Tsar
approached
first

experienced
the
same
feeling
as
every
other
man
in
that
army

a
feeling
of
self
forgetfulness

a
proud
consciousness
of
might

and
a
passionate
attraction
to
him
who
was
the
cause
of
this
triumph


He
felt
that
at
a
single
word
from
that
man
all
this
vast
mass

and
he
himself
an
insignificant
atom
in
it

would
go
through
fire
and
water

commit
crime

die

or
perform
deeds
of
highest
heroism

and
so
he
could
not
but
tremble
and
his
heart
stand
still
at
the
imminence
of
that
word





Hurrah

Hurrah

Hurrah




thundered
from
all
sides

one
regiment
after
another
greeting
the
Tsar
with
the
strains
of
the
march

and
then



Hurrah







Then
the
general
march

and
again



Hurrah

Hurrah




growing
ever
stronger
and
fuller
and
merging
into
a
deafening
roar


Till
the
Tsar
reached
it

each
regiment
in
its
silence
and
immobility
seemed
like
a
lifeless
body

but
as
soon
as
he
came
up
it
became
alive

its
thunder
joining
the
roar
of
the
whole
line
along
which
he
had
already
passed

Through
the
terrible
and
deafening
roar
of
those
voices

amid
the
square
masses
of
troops
standing
motionless
as
if
turned
to
stone

hundreds
of
riders
composing
the
suites
moved
carelessly
but
symmetrically
and
above
all
freely

and
in
front
of
them
two
men


the
Emperors

Upon
them
the
undivided

tensely
passionate
attention
of
that
whole
mass
of
men
was
concentrated


The
handsome
young
Emperor
Alexander

in
the
uniform
of
the
Horse
Guards

wearing
a
cocked
hat
with
its
peaks
front
and
back

with
his
pleasant
face
and
resonant
though
not
loud
voice

attracted
everyone


s
attention


Rost

v
was
not
far
from
the
trumpeters

and
with
his
keen
sight
had
recognized
the
Tsar
and
watched
his
approach

When
he
was
within
twenty
paces

and
Nicholas
could
clearly
distinguish
every
detail
of
his
handsome

happy
young
face

he
experienced
a
feeling
of
tenderness
and
ecstasy
such
as
he
had
never
before
known

Every
trait
and
every
movement
of
the
Tsar


s
seemed
to
him
enchanting


Stopping
in
front
of
the
P

vlograds

the
Tsar
said
something
in
French
to
the
Austrian
Emperor
and
smiled


Seeing
that
smile

Rost

v
involuntarily
smiled
himself
and
felt
a
still
stronger
flow
of
love
for
his
sovereign

He
longed
to
show
that
love
in
some
way
and
knowing
that
this
was
impossible
was
ready
to
cry

The
Tsar
called
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
and
said
a
few
words
to
him





Oh
God

what
would
happen
to
me
if
the
Emperor
spoke
to
me




thought
Rost

v




I
should
die
of
happiness





The
Tsar
addressed
the
officers
also




I
thank
you
all

gentlemen

I
thank
you
with
my
whole
heart




To
Rost

v
every
word
sounded
like
a
voice
from
heaven

How
gladly
would
he
have
died
at
once
for
his
Tsar





You
have
earned
the
St

George


s
standards
and
will
be
worthy
of
them








Oh

to
die

to
die
for
him




thought
Rost

v


The
Tsar
said
something
more
which
Rost

v
did
not
hear

and
the
soldiers

straining
their
lungs

shouted



Hurrah





Rost

v
too

bending
over
his
saddle

shouted



Hurrah




with
all
his
might

feeling
that
he
would
like
to
injure
himself
by
that
shout

if
only
to
express
his
rapture
fully


The
Tsar
stopped
a
few
minutes
in
front
of
the
hussars
as
if
undecided





How
can
the
Emperor
be
undecided




thought
Rost

v

but
then
even
this
indecision
appeared
to
him
majestic
and
enchanting

like
everything
else
the
Tsar
did


That
hesitation
lasted
only
an
instant

The
Tsar


s
foot

in
the
narrow
pointed
boot
then
fashionable

touched
the
groin
of
the
bobtailed
bay
mare
he
rode

his
hand
in
a
white
glove
gathered
up
the
reins

and
he
moved
off
accompanied
by
an
irregularly
swaying
sea
of
aides
de
camp

Farther
and
farther
he
rode
away

stopping
at
other
regiments

till
at
last
only
his
white
plumes
were
visible
to
Rost

v
from
amid
the
suites
that
surrounded
the
Emperors


Among
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite

Rost

v
noticed
Bolk

nski

sitting
his
horse
indolently
and
carelessly

Rost

v
recalled
their
quarrel
of
yesterday
and
the
question
presented
itself
whether
he
ought
or
ought
not
to
challenge
Bolk

nski




Of
course
not




he
now
thought




Is
it
worth
thinking
or
speaking
of
it
at
such
a
moment

At
a
time
of
such
love

such
rapture

and
such
self
sacrifice

what
do
any
of
our
quarrels
and
affronts
matter

I
love
and
forgive
everybody
now





When
the
Emperor
had
passed
nearly
all
the
regiments

the
troops
began
a
ceremonial
march
past
him

and
Rost

v
on
Bedouin

recently
purchased
from
Den

sov

rode
past
too

at
the
rear
of
his
squadron


that
is

alone
and
in
full
view
of
the
Emperor


Before
he
reached
him

Rost

v

who
was
a
splendid
horseman

spurred
Bedouin
twice
and
successfully
put
him
to
the
showy
trot
in
which
the
animal
went
when
excited

Bending
his
foaming
muzzle
to
his
chest

his
tail
extended

Bedouin

as
if
also
conscious
of
the
Emperor


s
eye
upon
him

passed
splendidly

lifting
his
feet
with
a
high
and
graceful
action

as
if
flying
through
the
air
without
touching
the
ground


Rost

v
himself

his
legs
well
back
and
his
stomach
drawn
in
and
feeling
himself
one
with
his
horse

rode
past
the
Emperor
with
a
frowning
but
blissful
face



like
a
vewy
devil




as
Den

sov
expressed
it





Fine
fellows

the
P

vlograds




remarked
the
Emperor





My
God

how
happy
I
should
be
if
he
ordered
me
to
leap
into
the
fire
this
instant




thought
Rost

v


When
the
review
was
over

the
newly
arrived
officers

and
also
Kut

zov


s

collected
in
groups
and
began
to
talk
about
the
awards

about
the
Austrians
and
their
uniforms

about
their
lines

about
Bonaparte

and
how
badly
the
latter
would
fare
now

especially
if
the
Essen
corps
arrived
and
Prussia
took
our
side


But
the
talk
in
every
group
was
chiefly
about
the
Emperor
Alexander

His
every
word
and
movement
was
described
with
ecstasy


They
all
had
but
one
wish

to
advance
as
soon
as
possible
against
the
enemy
under
the
Emperor


s
command

Commanded
by
the
Emperor
himself
they
could
not
fail
to
vanquish
anyone

be
it
whom
it
might

so
thought
Rost

v
and
most
of
the
officers
after
the
review


All
were
then
more
confident
of
victory
than
the
winning
of
two
battles
would
have
made
them






CHAPTER
IX

The
day
after
the
review

Bor

s

in
his
best
uniform
and
with
his
comrade
Berg


s
best
wishes
for
success

rode
to
Olm

tz
to
see
Bolk

nski

wishing
to
profit
by
his
friendliness
and
obtain
for
himself
the
best
post
he
could


preferably
that
of
adjutant
to
some
important
personage

a
position
in
the
army
which
seemed
to
him
most
attractive




It
is
all
very
well
for
Rost

v

whose
father
sends
him
ten
thousand
rubles
at
a
time

to
talk
about
not
wishing
to
cringe
to
anybody
and
not
be
anyone


s
lackey

but
I
who
have
nothing
but
my
brains
have
to
make
a
career
and
must
not
miss
opportunities

but
must
avail
myself
of
them




he
reflected


He
did
not
find
Prince
Andrew
in
Olm

tz
that
day

but
the
appearance
of
the
town
where
the
headquarters
and
the
diplomatic
corps
were
stationed
and
the
two
Emperors
were
living
with
their
suites

households

and
courts
only
strengthened
his
desire
to
belong
to
that
higher
world


He
knew
no
one

and
despite
his
smart
Guardsman


s
uniform

all
these
exalted
personages
passing
in
the
streets
in
their
elegant
carriages
with
their
plumes

ribbons

and
medals

both
courtiers
and
military
men

seemed
so
immeasurably
above
him

an
insignificant
officer
of
the
Guards

that
they
not
only
did
not
wish
to

but
simply
could
not

be
aware
of
his
existence

At
the
quarters
of
the
commander
in
chief

Kut

zov

where
he
inquired
for
Bolk

nski

all
the
adjutants
and
even
the
orderlies
looked
at
him
as
if
they
wished
to
impress
on
him
that
a
great
many
officers
like
him
were
always
coming
there
and
that
everybody
was
heartily
sick
of
them

In
spite
of
this

or
rather
because
of
it

next
day

November




after
dinner
he
again
went
to
Olm

tz
and

entering
the
house
occupied
by
Kut

zov

asked
for
Bolk

nski

Prince
Andrew
was
in
and
Bor

s
was
shown
into
a
large
hall
probably
formerly
used
for
dancing

but
in
which
five
beds
now
stood

and
furniture
of
various
kinds

a
table

chairs

and
a
clavichord

One
adjutant

nearest
the
door

was
sitting
at
the
table
in
a
Persian
dressing
gown

writing

Another

the
red

stout
Nesv

tski

lay
on
a
bed
with
his
arms
under
his
head

laughing
with
an
officer
who
had
sat
down
beside
him

A
third
was
playing
a
Viennese
waltz
on
the
clavichord

while
a
fourth

lying
on
the
clavichord

sang
the
tune

Bolk

nski
was
not
there

None
of
these
gentlemen
changed
his
position
on
seeing
Bor

s

The
one
who
was
writing
and
whom
Bor

s
addressed
turned
round
crossly
and
told
him
Bolk

nski
was
on
duty
and
that
he
should
go
through
the
door
on
the
left
into
the
reception
room
if
he
wished
to
see
him

Bor

s
thanked
him
and
went
to
the
reception
room

where
he
found
some
ten
officers
and
generals


When
he
entered

Prince
Andrew

his
eyes
drooping
contemptuously

with
that
peculiar
expression
of
polite
weariness
which
plainly
says




If
it
were
not
my
duty
I
would
not
talk
to
you
for
a
moment





was
listening
to
an
old
Russian
general
with
decorations

who
stood
very
erect

almost
on
tiptoe

with
a
soldier


s
obsequious
expression
on
his
purple
face

reporting
something





Very
well

then

be
so
good
as
to
wait




said
Prince
Andrew
to
the
general

in
Russian

speaking
with
the
French
intonation
he
affected
when
he
wished
to
speak
contemptuously

and
noticing
Bor

s

Prince
Andrew

paying
no
more
heed
to
the
general
who
ran
after
him
imploring
him
to
hear
something
more

nodded
and
turned
to
him
with
a
cheerful
smile


At
that
moment
Bor

s
clearly
realized
what
he
had
before
surmised

that
in
the
army

besides
the
subordination
and
discipline
prescribed
in
the
military
code

which
he
and
the
others
knew
in
the
regiment

there
was
another

more
important

subordination

which
made
this
tight
laced

purple
faced
general
wait
respectfully
while
Captain
Prince
Andrew

for
his
own
pleasure

chose
to
chat
with
Lieutenant
Drubetsk

y

More
than
ever
was
Bor

s
resolved
to
serve
in
future
not
according
to
the
written
code

but
under
this
unwritten
law

He
felt
now
that
merely
by
having
been
recommended
to
Prince
Andrew
he
had
already
risen
above
the
general
who
at
the
front
had
the
power
to
annihilate
him

a
lieutenant
of
the
Guards

Prince
Andrew
came
up
to
him
and
took
his
hand





I
am
very
sorry
you
did
not
find
me
in
yesterday

I
was
fussing
about
with
Germans
all
day

We
went
with
Weyrother
to
survey
the
dispositions

When
Germans
start
being
accurate

there


s
no
end
to
it





Bor

s
smiled

as
if
he
understood
what
Prince
Andrew
was
alluding
to
as
something
generally
known

But
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
Weyrother


s
name

or
even
the
term



dispositions








Well

my
dear
fellow

so
you
still
want
to
be
an
adjutant

I
have
been
thinking
about
you








Yes

I
was
thinking





for
some
reason
Bor

s
could
not
help
blushing





of
asking
the
commander
in
chief

He
has
had
a
letter
from
Prince
Kur

gin
about
me

I
only
wanted
to
ask
because
I
fear
the
Guards
won


t
be
in
action




he
added
as
if
in
apology





All
right

all
right

We


ll
talk
it
over




replied
Prince
Andrew




Only
let
me
report
this
gentleman


s
business

and
I
shall
be
at
your
disposal





While
Prince
Andrew
went
to
report
about
the
purple
faced
general

that
gentleman


evidently
not
sharing
Bor

s



conception
of
the
advantages
of
the
unwritten
code
of
subordination


looked
so
fixedly
at
the
presumptuous
lieutenant
who
had
prevented
his
finishing
what
he
had
to
say
to
the
adjutant
that
Bor

s
felt
uncomfortable

He
turned
away
and
waited
impatiently
for
Prince
Andrew


s
return
from
the
commander
in
chief


s
room





You
see

my
dear
fellow

I
have
been
thinking
about
you




said
Prince
Andrew
when
they
had
gone
into
the
large
room
where
the
clavichord
was




It


s
no
use
your
going
to
the
commander
in
chief

He
would
say
a
lot
of
pleasant
things

ask
you
to
dinner







That
would
not
be
bad
as
regards
the
unwritten
code




thought
Bor

s





but
nothing
more
would
come
of
it

There
will
soon
be
a
battalion
of
us
aides
de
camp
and
adjutants

But
this
is
what
we


ll
do

I
have
a
good
friend

an
adjutant
general
and
an
excellent
fellow

Prince
Dolgor

kov

and
though
you
may
not
know
it

the
fact
is
that
now
Kut

zov
with
his
staff
and
all
of
us
count
for
nothing

Everything
is
now
centered
round
the
Emperor

So
we
will
go
to
Dolgor

kov

I
have
to
go
there
anyhow
and
I
have
already
spoken
to
him
about
you

We
shall
see
whether
he
cannot
attach
you
to
himself
or
find
a
place
for
you
somewhere
nearer
the
sun





Prince
Andrew
always
became
specially
keen
when
he
had
to
guide
a
young
man
and
help
him
to
worldly
success

Under
cover
of
obtaining
help
of
this
kind
for
another

which
from
pride
he
would
never
accept
for
himself

he
kept
in
touch
with
the
circle
which
confers
success
and
which
attracted
him

He
very
readily
took
up
Bor

s



cause
and
went
with
him
to
Dolgor

kov


It
was
late
in
the
evening
when
they
entered
the
palace
at
Olm

tz
occupied
by
the
Emperors
and
their
retinues


That
same
day
a
council
of
war
had
been
held
in
which
all
the
members
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
and
both
Emperors
took
part

At
that
council

contrary
to
the
views
of
the
old
generals
Kut

zov
and
Prince
Schwartzenberg

it
had
been
decided
to
advance
immediately
and
give
battle
to
Bonaparte

The
council
of
war
was
just
over
when
Prince
Andrew
accompanied
by
Bor

s
arrived
at
the
palace
to
find
Dolgor

kov

Everyone
at
headquarters
was
still
under
the
spell
of
the
day


s
council

at
which
the
party
of
the
young
had
triumphed

The
voices
of
those
who
counseled
delay
and
advised
waiting
for
something
else
before
advancing
had
been
so
completely
silenced
and
their
arguments
confuted
by
such
conclusive
evidence
of
the
advantages
of
attacking
that
what
had
been
discussed
at
the
council


the
coming
battle
and
the
victory
that
would
certainly
result
from
it


no
longer
seemed
to
be
in
the
future
but
in
the
past

All
the
advantages
were
on
our
side

Our
enormous
forces

undoubtedly
superior
to
Napoleon


s

were
concentrated
in
one
place

the
troops
inspired
by
the
Emperors



presence
were
eager
for
action

The
strategic
position
where
the
operations
would
take
place
was
familiar
in
all
its
details
to
the
Austrian
General
Weyrother

a
lucky
accident
had
ordained
that
the
Austrian
army
should
maneuver
the
previous
year
on
the
very
fields
where
the
French
had
now
to
be
fought

the
adjacent
locality
was
known
and
shown
in
every
detail
on
the
maps

and
Bonaparte

evidently
weakened

was
undertaking
nothing


Dolgor

kov

one
of
the
warmest
advocates
of
an
attack

had
just
returned
from
the
council

tired
and
exhausted
but
eager
and
proud
of
the
victory
that
had
been
gained

Prince
Andrew
introduced
his
prot

g



but
Prince
Dolgor

kov
politely
and
firmly
pressing
his
hand
said
nothing
to
Bor

s
and

evidently
unable
to
suppress
the
thoughts
which
were
uppermost
in
his
mind
at
that
moment

addressed
Prince
Andrew
in
French





Ah

my
dear
fellow

what
a
battle
we
have
gained

God
grant
that
the
one
that
will
result
from
it
will
be
as
victorious

However

dear
fellow




he
said
abruptly
and
eagerly




I
must
confess
to
having
been
unjust
to
the
Austrians
and
especially
to
Weyrother

What
exactitude

what
minuteness

what
knowledge
of
the
locality

what
foresight
for
every
eventuality

every
possibility
even
to
the
smallest
detail

No

my
dear
fellow

no
conditions
better
than
our
present
ones
could
have
been
devised

This
combination
of
Austrian
precision
with
Russian
valor


what
more
could
be
wished
for








So
the
attack
is
definitely
resolved
on




asked
Bolk

nski





And
do
you
know

my
dear
fellow

it
seems
to
me
that
Bonaparte
has
decidedly
lost
bearings

you
know
that
a
letter
was
received
from
him
today
for
the
Emperor




Dolgor

kov
smiled
significantly





Is
that
so

And
what
did
he
say




inquired
Bolk

nski





What
can
he
say

Tra
di
ri
di
ra
and
so
on



merely
to
gain
time

I
tell
you
he
is
in
our
hands

that


s
certain

But
what
was
most
amusing




he
continued

with
a
sudden

good
natured
laugh




was
that
we
could
not
think
how
to
address
the
reply

If
not
as



Consul



and
of
course
not
as



Emperor




it
seemed
to
me
it
should
be
to



General
Bonaparte











But
between
not
recognizing
him
as
Emperor
and
calling
him
General
Bonaparte

there
is
a
difference




remarked
Bolk

nski





That


s
just
it




interrupted
Dolgor

kov
quickly

laughing




You
know
Bil

bin


he


s
a
very
clever
fellow

He
suggested
addressing
him
as



Usurper
and
Enemy
of
Mankind








Dolgor

kov
laughed
merrily





Only
that




said
Bolk

nski





All
the
same

it
was
Bil

bin
who
found
a
suitable
form
for
the
address

He
is
a
wise
and
clever
fellow








What
was
it








To
the
Head
of
the
French
Government



Au
chef
du
gouvernement
fran

ais




said
Dolgor

kov

with
grave
satisfaction




Good

wasn


t
it








Yes

but
he
will
dislike
it
extremely




said
Bolk

nski





Oh
yes

very
much

My
brother
knows
him

he


s
dined
with
him


the
present
Emperor


more
than
once
in
Paris

and
tells
me
he
never
met
a
more
cunning
or
subtle
diplomatist


you
know

a
combination
of
French
adroitness
and
Italian
play
acting

Do
you
know
the
tale
about
him
and
Count
Mark

v

Count
Mark

v
was
the
only
man
who
knew
how
to
handle
him

You
know
the
story
of
the
handkerchief

It
is
delightful





And
the
talkative
Dolgor

kov

turning
now
to
Bor

s

now
to
Prince
Andrew

told
how
Bonaparte
wishing
to
test
Mark

v

our
ambassador

purposely
dropped
a
handkerchief
in
front
of
him
and
stood
looking
at
Mark

v

probably
expecting
Mark

v
to
pick
it
up
for
him

and
how
Mark

v
immediately
dropped
his
own
beside
it
and
picked
it
up
without
touching
Bonaparte


s





Delightful




said
Bolk

nski




But
I
have
come
to
you

Prince

as
a
petitioner
on
behalf
of
this
young
man

You
see






but
before
Prince
Andrew
could
finish

an
aide
de
camp
came
in
to
summon
Dolgor

kov
to
the
Emperor





Oh

what
a
nuisance




said
Dolgor

kov

getting
up
hurriedly
and
pressing
the
hands
of
Prince
Andrew
and
Bor

s




You
know
I
should
be
very
glad
to
do
all
in
my
power
both
for
you
and
for
this
dear
young
man




Again
he
pressed
the
hand
of
the
latter
with
an
expression
of
good
natured

sincere

and
animated
levity




But
you
see



another
time





Bor

s
was
excited
by
the
thought
of
being
so
close
to
the
higher
powers
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
at
that
moment

He
was
conscious
that
here
he
was
in
contact
with
the
springs
that
set
in
motion
the
enormous
movements
of
the
mass
of
which
in
his
regiment
he
felt
himself
a
tiny

obedient

and
insignificant
atom

They
followed
Prince
Dolgor

kov
out
into
the
corridor
and
met


coming
out
of
the
door
of
the
Emperor


s
room
by
which
Dolgor

kov
had
entered


a
short
man
in
civilian
clothes
with
a
clever
face
and
sharply
projecting
jaw
which

without
spoiling
his
face

gave
him
a
peculiar
vivacity
and
shiftiness
of
expression

This
short
man
nodded
to
Dolgor

kov
as
to
an
intimate
friend
and
stared
at
Prince
Andrew
with
cool
intensity

walking
straight
toward
him
and
evidently
expecting
him
to
bow
or
to
step
out
of
his
way

Prince
Andrew
did
neither

a
look
of
animosity
appeared
on
his
face
and
the
other
turned
away
and
went
down
the
side
of
the
corridor





Who
was
that




asked
Bor

s





He
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable

but
to
me
most
unpleasant
of
men


the
Minister
of
Foreign
Affairs

Prince
Adam
Czartor

ski




It
is
such
men
as
he
who
decide
the
fate
of
nations




added
Bolk

nski
with
a
sigh
he
could
not
suppress

as
they
passed
out
of
the
palace


Next
day

the
army
began
its
campaign

and
up
to
the
very
battle
of
Austerlitz

Bor

s
was
unable
to
see
either
Prince
Andrew
or
Dolgor

kov
again
and
remained
for
a
while
with
the
Ism

ylov
regiment






CHAPTER
X

At
dawn
on
the
sixteenth
of
November

Den

sov


s
squadron

in
which
Nicholas
Rost

v
served
and
which
was
in
Prince
Bagrati

n


s
detachment

moved
from
the
place
where
it
had
spent
the
night

advancing
into
action
as
arranged

and
after
going
behind
other
columns
for
about
two
thirds
of
a
mile
was
stopped
on
the
highroad

Rost

v
saw
the
Cossacks
and
then
the
first
and
second
squadrons
of
hussars
and
infantry
battalions
and
artillery
pass
by
and
go
forward
and
then
Generals
Bagrati

n
and
Dolgor

kov
ride
past
with
their
adjutants

All
the
fear
before
action
which
he
had
experienced
as
previously

all
the
inner
struggle
to
conquer
that
fear

all
his
dreams
of
distinguishing
himself
as
a
true
hussar
in
this
battle

had
been
wasted

Their
squadron
remained
in
reserve
and
Nicholas
Rost

v
spent
that
day
in
a
dull
and
wretched
mood

At
nine
in
the
morning

he
heard
firing
in
front
and
shouts
of
hurrah

and
saw
wounded
being
brought
back

there
were
not
many
of
them


and
at
last
he
saw
how
a
whole
detachment
of
French
cavalry
was
brought
in

convoyed
by
a
s

tnya
of
Cossacks

Evidently
the
affair
was
over
and

though
not
big

had
been
a
successful
engagement

The
men
and
officers
returning
spoke
of
a
brilliant
victory

of
the
occupation
of
the
town
of
Wischau
and
the
capture
of
a
whole
French
squadron

The
day
was
bright
and
sunny
after
a
sharp
night
frost

and
the
cheerful
glitter
of
that
autumn
day
was
in
keeping
with
the
news
of
victory
which
was
conveyed

not
only
by
the
tales
of
those
who
had
taken
part
in
it

but
also
by
the
joyful
expression
on
the
faces
of
soldiers

officers

generals

and
adjutants

as
they
passed
Rost

v
going
or
coming

And
Nicholas

who
had
vainly
suffered
all
the
dread
that
precedes
a
battle
and
had
spent
that
happy
day
in
inactivity

was
all
the
more
depressed





Come
here

Wost

v

Let


s
dwink
to
dwown
our
gwief




shouted
Den

sov

who
had
settled
down
by
the
roadside
with
a
flask
and
some
food


The
officers
gathered
round
Den

sov


s
canteen

eating
and
talking





There

They
are
bringing
another




cried
one
of
the
officers

indicating
a
captive
French
dragoon
who
was
being
brought
in
on
foot
by
two
Cossacks


One
of
them
was
leading
by
the
bridle
a
fine
large
French
horse
he
had
taken
from
the
prisoner





Sell
us
that
horse




Den

sov
called
out
to
the
Cossacks





If
you
like

your
honor





The
officers
got
up
and
stood
round
the
Cossacks
and
their
prisoner

The
French
dragoon
was
a
young
Alsatian
who
spoke
French
with
a
German
accent

He
was
breathless
with
agitation

his
face
was
red

and
when
he
heard
some
French
spoken
he
at
once
began
speaking
to
the
officers

addressing
first
one

then
another

He
said
he
would
not
have
been
taken

it
was
not
his
fault
but
the
corporal


s
who
had
sent
him
to
seize
some
horsecloths

though
he
had
told
him
the
Russians
were
there

And
at
every
word
he
added




But
don


t
hurt
my
little
horse




and
stroked
the
animal

It
was
plain
that
he
did
not
quite
grasp
where
he
was

Now
he
excused
himself
for
having
been
taken
prisoner
and
now

imagining
himself
before
his
own
officers

insisted
on
his
soldierly
discipline
and
zeal
in
the
service

He
brought
with
him
into
our
rearguard
all
the
freshness
of
atmosphere
of
the
French
army

which
was
so
alien
to
us


The
Cossacks
sold
the
horse
for
two
gold
pieces

and
Rost

v

being
the
richest
of
the
officers
now
that
he
had
received
his
money

bought
it





But
don


t
hurt
my
little
horse




said
the
Alsatian
good
naturedly
to
Rost

v
when
the
animal
was
handed
over
to
the
hussar


Rost

v
smilingly
reassured
the
dragoon
and
gave
him
money





Alley

Alley




said
the
Cossack

touching
the
prisoner


s
arm
to
make
him
go
on





The
Emperor

The
Emperor




was
suddenly
heard
among
the
hussars


All
began
to
run
and
bustle

and
Rost

v
saw
coming
up
the
road
behind
him
several
riders
with
white
plumes
in
their
hats

In
a
moment
everyone
was
in
his
place

waiting


Rost

v
did
not
know
or
remember
how
he
ran
to
his
place
and
mounted

Instantly
his
regret
at
not
having
been
in
action
and
his
dejected
mood
amid
people
of
whom
he
was
weary
had
gone

instantly
every
thought
of
himself
had
vanished

He
was
filled
with
happiness
at
his
nearness
to
the
Emperor

He
felt
that
this
nearness
by
itself
made
up
to
him
for
the
day
he
had
lost

He
was
happy
as
a
lover
when
the
longed
for
moment
of
meeting
arrives

Not
daring
to
look
round
and
without
looking
round

he
was
ecstatically
conscious
of
his
approach

He
felt
it
not
only
from
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
of
the
approaching
cavalcade

but
because
as
he
drew
near
everything
grew
brighter

more
joyful

more
significant

and
more
festive
around
him

Nearer
and
nearer
to
Rost

v
came
that
sun
shedding
beams
of
mild
and
majestic
light
around

and
already
he
felt
himself
enveloped
in
those
beams

he
heard
his
voice

that
kindly

calm

and
majestic
voice
that
was
yet
so
simple

And
as
if
in
accord
with
Rost

v


s
feeling

there
was
a
deathly
stillness
amid
which
was
heard
the
Emperor


s
voice





The
P

vlograd
hussars




he
inquired





The
reserves

sire




replied
a
voice

a
very
human
one
compared
to
that
which
had
said




The
P

vlograd
hussars





The
Emperor
drew
level
with
Rost

v
and
halted

Alexander


s
face
was
even
more
beautiful
than
it
had
been
three
days
before
at
the
review

It
shone
with
such
gaiety
and
youth

such
innocent
youth

that
it
suggested
the
liveliness
of
a
fourteen
year
old
boy

and
yet
it
was
the
face
of
the
majestic
Emperor

Casually

while
surveying
the
squadron

the
Emperor


s
eyes
met
Rost

v


s
and
rested
on
them
for
not
more
than
two
seconds

Whether
or
no
the
Emperor
understood
what
was
going
on
in
Rost

v


s
soul

it
seemed
to
Rost

v
that
he
understood
everything


at
any
rate
his
light
blue
eyes
gazed
for
about
two
seconds
into
Rost

v


s
face

A
gentle

mild
light
poured
from
them

Then
all
at
once
he
raised
his
eyebrows

abruptly
touched
his
horse
with
his
left
foot

and
galloped
on


The
younger
Emperor
could
not
restrain
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
battle
and

in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
his
courtiers

at
twelve
o


clock
left
the
third
column
with
which
he
had
been
and
galloped
toward
the
vanguard

Before
he
came
up
with
the
hussars

several
adjutants
met
him
with
news
of
the
successful
result
of
the
action


This
battle

which
consisted
in
the
capture
of
a
French
squadron

was
represented
as
a
brilliant
victory
over
the
French

and
so
the
Emperor
and
the
whole
army

especially
while
the
smoke
hung
over
the
battlefield

believed
that
the
French
had
been
defeated
and
were
retreating
against
their
will

A
few
minutes
after
the
Emperor
had
passed

the
P

vlograd
division
was
ordered
to
advance

In
Wischau
itself

a
petty
German
town

Rost

v
saw
the
Emperor
again

In
the
market
place

where
there
had
been
some
rather
heavy
firing
before
the
Emperor


s
arrival

lay
several
killed
and
wounded
soldiers
whom
there
had
not
been
time
to
move

The
Emperor

surrounded
by
his
suite
of
officers
and
courtiers

was
riding
a
bobtailed
chestnut
mare

a
different
one
from
that
which
he
had
ridden
at
the
review

and
bending
to
one
side
he
gracefully
held
a
gold
lorgnette
to
his
eyes
and
looked
at
a
soldier
who
lay
prone

with
blood
on
his
uncovered
head

The
wounded
soldier
was
so
dirty

coarse

and
revolting
that
his
proximity
to
the
Emperor
shocked
Rost

v

Rost

v
saw
how
the
Emperor


s
rather
round
shoulders
shuddered
as
if
a
cold
shiver
had
run
down
them

how
his
left
foot
began
convulsively
tapping
the
horse


s
side
with
the
spur

and
how
the
well
trained
horse
looked
round
unconcerned
and
did
not
stir

An
adjutant

dismounting

lifted
the
soldier
under
the
arms
to
place
him
on
a
stretcher
that
had
been
brought

The
soldier
groaned





Gently

gently

Can


t
you
do
it
more
gently




said
the
Emperor
apparently
suffering
more
than
the
dying
soldier

and
he
rode
away


Rost

v
saw
tears
filling
the
Emperor


s
eyes
and
heard
him

as
he
was
riding
away

say
to
Czartor

ski




What
a
terrible
thing
war
is

what
a
terrible
thing

Quelle
terrible
chose
que
la
guerre





The
troops
of
the
vanguard
were
stationed
before
Wischau

within
sight
of
the
enemy


s
lines

which
all
day
long
had
yielded
ground
to
us
at
the
least
firing

The
Emperor


s
gratitude
was
announced
to
the
vanguard

rewards
were
promised

and
the
men
received
a
double
ration
of
vodka

The
campfires
crackled
and
the
soldiers



songs
resounded
even
more
merrily
than
on
the
previous
night

Den

sov
celebrated
his
promotion
to
the
rank
of
major

and
Rost

v

who
had
already
drunk
enough

at
the
end
of
the
feast
proposed
the
Emperor


s
health




Not



our
Sovereign

the
Emperor




as
they
say
at
official
dinners




said
he




but
the
health
of
our
Sovereign

that
good

enchanting

and
great
man

Let
us
drink
to
his
health
and
to
the
certain
defeat
of
the
French








If
we
fought
before




he
said




not
letting
the
French
pass

as
at
Sch

n
Grabern

what
shall
we
not
do
now
when
he
is
at
the
front

We
will
all
die
for
him
gladly

Is
it
not
so

gentlemen

Perhaps
I
am
not
saying
it
right

I
have
drunk
a
good
deal


but
that
is
how
I
feel

and
so
do
you
too

To
the
health
of
Alexander
the
First

Hurrah








Hurrah




rang
the
enthusiastic
voices
of
the
officers


And
the
old
cavalry
captain

K

rsten

shouted
enthusiastically
and
no
less
sincerely
than
the
twenty
year
old
Rost

v


When
the
officers
had
emptied
and
smashed
their
glasses

K

rsten
filled
others
and

in
shirt
sleeves
and
breeches

went
glass
in
hand
to
the
soldiers



bonfires
and
with
his
long
gray
mustache

his
white
chest
showing
under
his
open
shirt

he
stood
in
a
majestic
pose
in
the
light
of
the
campfire

waving
his
uplifted
arm





Lads

here


s
to
our
Sovereign

the
Emperor

and
victory
over
our
enemies

Hurrah




he
exclaimed
in
his
dashing

old

hussar


s
baritone


The
hussars
crowded
round
and
responded
heartily
with
loud
shouts


Late
that
night

when
all
had
separated

Den

sov
with
his
short
hand
patted
his
favorite

Rost

v

on
the
shoulder





As
there


s
no
one
to
fall
in
love
with
on
campaign

he


s
fallen
in
love
with
the
Tsar




he
said





Den

sov

don


t
make
fun
of
it




cried
Rost

v




It
is
such
a
lofty

beautiful
feeling

such
a










I
believe
it

I
believe
it

fwiend

and
I
share
and
appwove










No

you
don


t
understand





And
Rost

v
got
up
and
went
wandering
among
the
campfires

dreaming
of
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
die


not
in
saving
the
Emperor


s
life

he
did
not
even
dare
to
dream
of
that


but
simply
to
die
before
his
eyes

He
really
was
in
love
with
the
Tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
Russian
arms
and
the
hope
of
future
triumph

And
he
was
not
the
only
man
to
experience
that
feeling
during
those
memorable
days
preceding
the
battle
of
Austerlitz

nine
tenths
of
the
men
in
the
Russian
army
were
then
in
love

though
less
ecstatically

with
their
Tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
Russian
arms






CHAPTER
XI

The
next
day
the
Emperor
stopped
at
Wischau

and
Villier

his
physician

was
repeatedly
summoned
to
see
him

At
headquarters
and
among
the
troops
near
by
the
news
spread
that
the
Emperor
was
unwell

He
ate
nothing
and
had
slept
badly
that
night

those
around
him
reported

The
cause
of
this
indisposition
was
the
strong
impression
made
on
his
sensitive
mind
by
the
sight
of
the
killed
and
wounded


At
daybreak
on
the
seventeenth

a
French
officer
who
had
come
with
a
flag
of
truce

demanding
an
audience
with
the
Russian
Emperor

was
brought
into
Wischau
from
our
outposts

This
officer
was
Savary

The
Emperor
had
only
just
fallen
asleep
and
so
Savary
had
to
wait

At
midday
he
was
admitted
to
the
Emperor

and
an
hour
later
he
rode
off
with
Prince
Dolgor

kov
to
the
advanced
post
of
the
French
army


It
was
rumored
that
Savary
had
been
sent
to
propose
to
Alexander
a
meeting
with
Napoleon

To
the
joy
and
pride
of
the
whole
army

a
personal
interview
was
refused

and
instead
of
the
Sovereign

Prince
Dolgor

kov

the
victor
at
Wischau

was
sent
with
Savary
to
negotiate
with
Napoleon
if

contrary
to
expectations

these
negotiations
were
actuated
by
a
real
desire
for
peace


Toward
evening
Dolgor

kov
came
back

went
straight
to
the
Tsar

and
remained
alone
with
him
for
a
long
time


On
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
of
November

the
army
advanced
two
days



march
and
the
enemy


s
outposts
after
a
brief
interchange
of
shots
retreated

In
the
highest
army
circles
from
midday
on
the
nineteenth

a
great

excitedly
bustling
activity
began
which
lasted
till
the
morning
of
the
twentieth

when
the
memorable
battle
of
Austerlitz
was
fought


Till
midday
on
the
nineteenth

the
activity


the
eager
talk

running
to
and
fro

and
dispatching
of
adjutants


was
confined
to
the
Emperor


s
headquarters

But
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day

this
activity
reached
Kut

zov


s
headquarters
and
the
staffs
of
the
commanders
of
columns

By
evening

the
adjutants
had
spread
it
to
all
ends
and
parts
of
the
army

and
in
the
night
from
the
nineteenth
to
the
twentieth

the
whole
eighty
thousand
allied
troops
rose
from
their
bivouacs
to
the
hum
of
voices

and
the
army
swayed
and
started
in
one
enormous
mass
six
miles
long


The
concentrated
activity
which
had
begun
at
the
Emperor


s
headquarters
in
the
morning
and
had
started
the
whole
movement
that
followed
was
like
the
first
movement
of
the
main
wheel
of
a
large
tower
clock

One
wheel
slowly
moved

another
was
set
in
motion

and
a
third

and
wheels
began
to
revolve
faster
and
faster

levers
and
cogwheels
to
work

chimes
to
play

figures
to
pop
out

and
the
hands
to
advance
with
regular
motion
as
a
result
of
all
that
activity


Just
as
in
the
mechanism
of
a
clock

so
in
the
mechanism
of
the
military
machine

an
impulse
once
given
leads
to
the
final
result

and
just
as
indifferently
quiescent
till
the
moment
when
motion
is
transmitted
to
them
are
the
parts
of
the
mechanism
which
the
impulse
has
not
yet
reached

Wheels
creak
on
their
axles
as
the
cogs
engage
one
another
and
the
revolving
pulleys
whirr
with
the
rapidity
of
their
movement

but
a
neighboring
wheel
is
as
quiet
and
motionless
as
though
it
were
prepared
to
remain
so
for
a
hundred
years

but
the
moment
comes
when
the
lever
catches
it
and
obeying
the
impulse
that
wheel
begins
to
creak
and
joins
in
the
common
motion
the
result
and
aim
of
which
are
beyond
its
ken


Just
as
in
a
clock

the
result
of
the
complicated
motion
of
innumerable
wheels
and
pulleys
is
merely
a
slow
and
regular
movement
of
the
hands
which
show
the
time

so
the
result
of
all
the
complicated
human
activities
of








Russians
and
French


all
their
passions

desires

remorse

humiliations

sufferings

outbursts
of
pride

fear

and
enthusiasm


was
only
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
Austerlitz

the
so
called
battle
of
the
three
Emperors


that
is
to
say

a
slow
movement
of
the
hand
on
the
dial
of
human
history


Prince
Andrew
was
on
duty
that
day
and
in
constant
attendance
on
the
commander
in
chief


At
six
in
the
evening

Kut

zov
went
to
the
Emperor


s
headquarters
and
after
staying
but
a
short
time
with
the
Tsar
went
to
see
the
grand
marshal
of
the
court

Count
Tolst

y


Bolk

nski
took
the
opportunity
to
go
in
to
get
some
details
of
the
coming
action
from
Dolgor

kov

He
felt
that
Kut

zov
was
upset
and
dissatisfied
about
something
and
that
at
headquarters
they
were
dissatisfied
with
him

and
also
that
at
the
Emperor


s
headquarters
everyone
adopted
toward
him
the
tone
of
men
who
know
something
others
do
not
know

he
therefore
wished
to
speak
to
Dolgor

kov





Well

how
d


you
do

my
dear
fellow




said
Dolgor

kov

who
was
sitting
at
tea
with
Bil

bin




The
fete
is
for
tomorrow

How
is
your
old
fellow

Out
of
sorts








I
won


t
say
he
is
out
of
sorts

but
I
fancy
he
would
like
to
be
heard








But
they
heard
him
at
the
council
of
war
and
will
hear
him
when
he
talks
sense

but
to
temporize
and
wait
for
something
now
when
Bonaparte
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
general
battle
is
impossible








Yes

you
have
seen
him




said
Prince
Andrew




Well

what
is
Bonaparte
like

How
did
he
impress
you








Yes

I
saw
him

and
am
convinced
that
he
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
general
engagement




repeated
Dolgor

kov

evidently
prizing
this
general
conclusion
which
he
had
arrived
at
from
his
interview
with
Napoleon




If
he
weren


t
afraid
of
a
battle
why
did
he
ask
for
that
interview

Why
negotiate

and
above
all
why
retreat

when
to
retreat
is
so
contrary
to
his
method
of
conducting
war

Believe
me

he
is
afraid

afraid
of
a
general
battle

His
hour
has
come

Mark
my
words








But
tell
me

what
is
he
like

eh




said
Prince
Andrew
again





He
is
a
man
in
a
gray
overcoat

very
anxious
that
I
should
call
him



Your
Majesty




but
who

to
his
chagrin

got
no
title
from
me

That


s
the
sort
of
man
he
is

and
nothing
more




replied
Dolgor

kov

looking
round
at
Bil

bin
with
a
smile





Despite
my
great
respect
for
old
Kut

zov




he
continued




we
should
be
a
nice
set
of
fellows
if
we
were
to
wait
about
and
so
give
him
a
chance
to
escape

or
to
trick
us

now
that
we
certainly
have
him
in
our
hands

No

we
mustn


t
forget
Suv

rov
and
his
rule


not
to
put
yourself
in
a
position
to
be
attacked

but
yourself
to
attack

Believe
me
in
war
the
energy
of
young
men
often
shows
the
way
better
than
all
the
experience
of
old
Cunctators








But
in
what
position
are
we
going
to
attack
him

I
have
been
at
the
outposts
today
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
his
chief
forces
are
situated




said
Prince
Andrew


He
wished
to
explain
to
Dolgor

kov
a
plan
of
attack
he
had
himself
formed





Oh

that
is
all
the
same




Dolgor

kov
said
quickly

and
getting
up
he
spread
a
map
on
the
table




All
eventualities
have
been
foreseen

If
he
is
standing
before
Br

nn







And
Prince
Dolgor

kov
rapidly
but
indistinctly
explained
Weyrother


s
plan
of
a
flanking
movement


Prince
Andrew
began
to
reply
and
to
state
his
own
plan

which
might
have
been
as
good
as
Weyrother


s

but
for
the
disadvantage
that
Weyrother


s
had
already
been
approved

As
soon
as
Prince
Andrew
began
to
demonstrate
the
defects
of
the
latter
and
the
merits
of
his
own
plan

Prince
Dolgor

kov
ceased
to
listen
to
him
and
gazed
absent
mindedly
not
at
the
map

but
at
Prince
Andrew


s
face





There
will
be
a
council
of
war
at
Kut

zov


s
tonight

though

you
can
say
all
this
there




remarked
Dolgor

kov





I
will
do
so




said
Prince
Andrew

moving
away
from
the
map





Whatever
are
you
bothering
about

gentlemen




said
Bil

bin

who

till
then

had
listened
with
an
amused
smile
to
their
conversation
and
now
was
evidently
ready
with
a
joke




Whether
tomorrow
brings
victory
or
defeat

the
glory
of
our
Russian
arms
is
secure

Except
your
Kut

zov

there
is
not
a
single
Russian
in
command
of
a
column

The
commanders
are

Herr
General
Wimpfen

le
Comte
de
Langeron

le
Prince
de
Lichtenstein

le
Prince

de
Hohenlohe

and
finally
Prishprish

and
so
on
like
all
those
Polish
names








Be
quiet

backbiter




said
Dolgor

kov




It
is
not
true

there
are
now
two
Russians

Milor

dovich

and
Dokht

rov

and
there
would
be
a
third

Count
Arakch

ev

if
his
nerves
were
not
too
weak








However

I
think
General
Kut

zov
has
come
out




said
Prince
Andrew




I
wish
you
good
luck
and
success

gentlemen




he
added
and
went
out
after
shaking
hands
with
Dolgor

kov
and
Bil

bin


On
the
way
home

Prince
Andrew
could
not
refrain
from
asking
Kut

zov

who
was
sitting
silently
beside
him

what
he
thought
of
tomorrow


s
battle


Kut

zov
looked
sternly
at
his
adjutant
and

after
a
pause

replied




I
think
the
battle
will
be
lost

and
so
I
told
Count
Tolst

y
and
asked
him
to
tell
the
Emperor

What
do
you
think
he
replied




But

my
dear
general

I
am
engaged
with
rice
and
cutlets

look
after
military
matters
yourself




Yes



That
was
the
answer
I
got









CHAPTER
XII

Shortly
after
nine
o


clock
that
evening

Weyrother
drove
with
his
plans
to
Kut

zov


s
quarters
where
the
council
of
war
was
to
be
held

All
the
commanders
of
columns
were
summoned
to
the
commander
in
chief


s
and
with
the
exception
of
Prince
Bagrati

n

who
declined
to
come

were
all
there
at
the
appointed
time


Weyrother

who
was
in
full
control
of
the
proposed
battle

by
his
eagerness
and
briskness
presented
a
marked
contrast
to
the
dissatisfied
and
drowsy
Kut

zov

who
reluctantly
played
the
part
of
chairman
and
president
of
the
council
of
war

Weyrother
evidently
felt
himself
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
movement
that
had
already
become
unrestrainable

He
was
like
a
horse
running
downhill
harnessed
to
a
heavy
cart

Whether
he
was
pulling
it
or
being
pushed
by
it
he
did
not
know

but
rushed
along
at
headlong
speed
with
no
time
to
consider
what
this
movement
might
lead
to

Weyrother
had
been
twice
that
evening
to
the
enemy


s
picket
line
to
reconnoiter
personally

and
twice
to
the
Emperors

Russian
and
Austrian

to
report
and
explain

and
to
his
headquarters
where
he
had
dictated
the
dispositions
in
German

and
now

much
exhausted

he
arrived
at
Kut

zov


s


He
was
evidently
so
busy
that
he
even
forgot
to
be
polite
to
the
commander
in
chief

He
interrupted
him

talked
rapidly
and
indistinctly

without
looking
at
the
man
he
was
addressing

and
did
not
reply
to
questions
put
to
him

He
was
bespattered
with
mud
and
had
a
pitiful

weary

and
distracted
air

though
at
the
same
time
he
was
haughty
and
self
confident


Kut

zov
was
occupying
a
nobleman


s
castle
of
modest
dimensions
near
Ostralitz

In
the
large
drawing
room
which
had
become
the
commander
in
chief


s
office
were
gathered
Kut

zov
himself

Weyrother

and
the
members
of
the
council
of
war

They
were
drinking
tea

and
only
awaited
Prince
Bagrati

n
to
begin
the
council

At
last
Bagrati

n


s
orderly
came
with
the
news
that
the
prince
could
not
attend

Prince
Andrew
came
in
to
inform
the
commander
in
chief
of
this
and

availing
himself
of
permission
previously
given
him
by
Kut

zov
to
be
present
at
the
council

he
remained
in
the
room





Since
Prince
Bagrati

n
is
not
coming

we
may
begin




said
Weyrother

hurriedly
rising
from
his
seat
and
going
up
to
the
table
on
which
an
enormous
map
of
the
environs
of
Br

nn
was
spread
out


Kut

zov

with
his
uniform
unbuttoned
so
that
his
fat
neck
bulged
over
his
collar
as
if
escaping

was
sitting
almost
asleep
in
a
low
chair

with
his
podgy
old
hands
resting
symmetrically
on
its
arms

At
the
sound
of
Weyrother


s
voice

he
opened
his
one
eye
with
an
effort





Yes

yes

if
you
please

It
is
already
late




said
he

and
nodding
his
head
he
let
it
droop
and
again
closed
his
eye


If
at
first
the
members
of
the
council
thought
that
Kut

zov
was
pretending
to
sleep

the
sounds
his
nose
emitted
during
the
reading
that
followed
proved
that
the
commander
in
chief
at
that
moment
was
absorbed
by
a
far
more
serious
matter
than
a
desire
to
show
his
contempt
for
the
dispositions
or
anything
else


he
was
engaged
in
satisfying
the
irresistible
human
need
for
sleep

He
really
was
asleep

Weyrother

with
the
gesture
of
a
man
too
busy
to
lose
a
moment

glanced
at
Kut

zov
and

having
convinced
himself
that
he
was
asleep

took
up
a
paper
and
in
a
loud

monotonous
voice
began
to
read
out
the
dispositions
for
the
impending
battle

under
a
heading
which
he
also
read
out





Dispositions
for
an
attack
on
the
enemy
position
behind
Kobelnitz
and
Sokolnitz

November














The
dispositions
were
very
complicated
and
difficult

They
began
as
follows





As
the
enemy


s
left
wing
rests
on
wooded
hills
and
his
right
extends
along
Kobelnitz
and
Sokolnitz
behind
the
ponds
that
are
there

while
we

on
the
other
hand

with
our
left
wing
by
far
outflank
his
right

it
is
advantageous
to
attack
the
enemy


s
latter
wing
especially
if
we
occupy
the
villages
of
Sokolnitz
and
Kobelnitz

whereby
we
can
both
fall
on
his
flank
and
pursue
him
over
the
plain
between
Schlappanitz
and
the
Thuerassa
forest

avoiding
the
defiles
of
Schlappanitz
and
Bellowitz
which
cover
the
enemy


s
front

For
this
object
it
is
necessary
that



The
first
column
marches



The
second
column
marches



The
third
column
marches






and
so
on

read
Weyrother


The
generals
seemed
to
listen
reluctantly
to
the
difficult
dispositions

The
tall

fair
haired
General
Buxh

wden
stood

leaning
his
back
against
the
wall

his
eyes
fixed
on
a
burning
candle

and
seemed
not
to
listen
or
even
to
wish
to
be
thought
to
listen

Exactly
opposite
Weyrother

with
his
glistening
wide
open
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
his
mustache
twisted
upwards

sat
the
ruddy
Milor

dovich
in
a
military
pose

his
elbows
turned
outwards

his
hands
on
his
knees

and
his
shoulders
raised

He
remained
stubbornly
silent

gazing
at
Weyrother


s
face

and
only
turned
away
his
eyes
when
the
Austrian
chief
of
staff
finished
reading

Then
Milor

dovich
looked
round
significantly
at
the
other
generals

But
one
could
not
tell
from
that
significant
look
whether
he
agreed
or
disagreed
and
was
satisfied
or
not
with
the
arrangements

Next
to
Weyrother
sat
Count
Langeron
who

with
a
subtle
smile
that
never
left
his
typically
southern
French
face
during
the
whole
time
of
the
reading

gazed
at
his
delicate
fingers
which
rapidly
twirled
by
its
corners
a
gold
snuffbox
on
which
was
a
portrait

In
the
middle
of
one
of
the
longest
sentences

he
stopped
the
rotary
motion
of
the
snuffbox

raised
his
head

and
with
inimical
politeness
lurking
in
the
corners
of
his
thin
lips
interrupted
Weyrother

wishing
to
say
something

But
the
Austrian
general

continuing
to
read

frowned
angrily
and
jerked
his
elbows

as
if
to
say




You
can
tell
me
your
views
later

but
now
be
so
good
as
to
look
at
the
map
and
listen




Langeron
lifted
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
perplexity

turned
round
to
Milor

dovich
as
if
seeking
an
explanation

but
meeting
the
latter


s
impressive
but
meaningless
gaze
drooped
his
eyes
sadly
and
again
took
to
twirling
his
snuffbox





A
geography
lesson




he
muttered
as
if
to
himself

but
loud
enough
to
be
heard


Przebysz

wski

with
respectful
but
dignified
politeness

held
his
hand
to
his
ear
toward
Weyrother

with
the
air
of
a
man
absorbed
in
attention

Dohkt

rov

a
little
man

sat
opposite
Weyrother

with
an
assiduous
and
modest
mien

and
stooping
over
the
outspread
map
conscientiously
studied
the
dispositions
and
the
unfamiliar
locality

He
asked
Weyrother
several
times
to
repeat
words
he
had
not
clearly
heard
and
the
difficult
names
of
villages

Weyrother
complied
and
Dohkt

rov
noted
them
down


When
the
reading
which
lasted
more
than
an
hour
was
over

Langeron
again
brought
his
snuffbox
to
rest
and

without
looking
at
Weyrother
or
at
anyone
in
particular

began
to
say
how
difficult
it
was
to
carry
out
such
a
plan
in
which
the
enemy


s
position
was
assumed
to
be
known

whereas
it
was
perhaps
not
known

since
the
enemy
was
in
movement

Langeron


s
objections
were
valid
but
it
was
obvious
that
their
chief
aim
was
to
show
General
Weyrother


who
had
read
his
dispositions
with
as
much
self
confidence
as
if
he
were
addressing
school
children


that
he
had
to
do

not
with
fools

but
with
men
who
could
teach
him
something
in
military
matters


When
the
monotonous
sound
of
Weyrother


s
voice
ceased

Kut

zov
opened
his
eye
as
a
miller
wakes
up
when
the
soporific
drone
of
the
mill
wheel
is
interrupted

He
listened
to
what
Langeron
said

as
if
remarking




So
you
are
still
at
that
silly
business




quickly
closed
his
eye
again

and
let
his
head
sink
still
lower


Langeron

trying
as
virulently
as
possible
to
sting
Weyrother


s
vanity
as
author
of
the
military
plan

argued
that
Bonaparte
might
easily
attack
instead
of
being
attacked

and
so
render
the
whole
of
this
plan
perfectly
worthless

Weyrother
met
all
objections
with
a
firm
and
contemptuous
smile

evidently
prepared
beforehand
to
meet
all
objections
be
they
what
they
might





If
he
could
attack
us

he
would
have
done
so
today




said
he





So
you
think
he
is
powerless




said
Langeron





He
has
forty
thousand
men
at
most




replied
Weyrother

with
the
smile
of
a
doctor
to
whom
an
old
wife
wishes
to
explain
the
treatment
of
a
case





In
that
case
he
is
inviting
his
doom
by
awaiting
our
attack




said
Langeron

with
a
subtly
ironical
smile

again
glancing
round
for
support
to
Milor

dovich
who
was
near
him


But
Milor

dovich
was
at
that
moment
evidently
thinking
of
anything
rather
than
of
what
the
generals
were
disputing
about





Ma
foi




said
he




tomorrow
we
shall
see
all
that
on
the
battlefield





Weyrother
again
gave
that
smile
which
seemed
to
say
that
to
him
it
was
strange
and
ridiculous
to
meet
objections
from
Russian
generals
and
to
have
to
prove
to
them
what
he
had
not
merely
convinced
himself
of

but
had
also
convinced
the
sovereign
Emperors
of





The
enemy
has
quenched
his
fires
and
a
continual
noise
is
heard
from
his
camp




said
he




What
does
that
mean

Either
he
is
retreating

which
is
the
only
thing
we
need
fear

or
he
is
changing
his
position





He
smiled
ironically





But
even
if
he
also
took
up
a
position
in
the
Thuerassa

he
merely
saves
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
all
our
arrangements
to
the
minutest
detail
remain
the
same








How
is
that







began
Prince
Andrew

who
had
for
long
been
waiting
an
opportunity
to
express
his
doubts


Kut

zov
here
woke
up

coughed
heavily

and
looked
round
at
the
generals





Gentlemen

the
dispositions
for
tomorrow


or
rather
for
today

for
it
is
past
midnight


cannot
now
be
altered




said
he




You
have
heard
them

and
we
shall
all
do
our
duty

But
before
a
battle

there
is
nothing
more
important






he
paused




than
to
have
a
good
sleep





He
moved
as
if
to
rise

The
generals
bowed
and
retired

It
was
past
midnight

Prince
Andrew
went
out


The
council
of
war

at
which
Prince
Andrew
had
not
been
able
to
express
his
opinion
as
he
had
hoped
to

left
on
him
a
vague
and
uneasy
impression

Whether
Dolgor

kov
and
Weyrother

or
Kut

zov

Langeron

and
the
others
who
did
not
approve
of
the
plan
of
attack

were
right


he
did
not
know




But
was
it
really
not
possible
for
Kut

zov
to
state
his
views
plainly
to
the
Emperor

Is
it
possible
that
on
account
of
court
and
personal
considerations
tens
of
thousands
of
lives

and
my
life

my
life




he
thought




must
be
risked








Yes

it
is
very
likely
that
I
shall
be
killed
tomorrow




he
thought

And
suddenly

at
this
thought
of
death

a
whole
series
of
most
distant

most
intimate

memories
rose
in
his
imagination

he
remembered
his
last
parting
from
his
father
and
his
wife

he
remembered
the
days
when
he
first
loved
her

He
thought
of
her
pregnancy
and
felt
sorry
for
her
and
for
himself

and
in
a
nervously
emotional
and
softened
mood
he
went
out
of
the
hut
in
which
he
was
billeted
with
Nesv

tski
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
before
it


The
night
was
foggy
and
through
the
fog
the
moonlight
gleamed
mysteriously




Yes

tomorrow

tomorrow




he
thought




Tomorrow
everything
may
be
over
for
me

All
these
memories
will
be
no
more

none
of
them
will
have
any
meaning
for
me

Tomorrow
perhaps

even
certainly

I
have
a
presentiment
that
for
the
first
time
I
shall
have
to
show
all
I
can
do




And
his
fancy
pictured
the
battle

its
loss

the
concentration
of
fighting
at
one
point

and
the
hesitation
of
all
the
commanders

And
then
that
happy
moment

that
Toulon
for
which
he
had
so
long
waited

presents
itself
to
him
at
last

He
firmly
and
clearly
expresses
his
opinion
to
Kut

zov

to
Weyrother

and
to
the
Emperors

All
are
struck
by
the
justness
of
his
views

but
no
one
undertakes
to
carry
them
out

so
he
takes
a
regiment

a
division


stipulates
that
no
one
is
to
interfere
with
his
arrangements


leads
his
division
to
the
decisive
point

and
gains
the
victory
alone




But
death
and
suffering




suggested
another
voice

Prince
Andrew

however

did
not
answer
that
voice
and
went
on
dreaming
of
his
triumphs

The
dispositions
for
the
next
battle
are
planned
by
him
alone

Nominally
he
is
only
an
adjutant
on
Kut

zov


s
staff

but
he
does
everything
alone

The
next
battle
is
won
by
him
alone

Kut

zov
is
removed
and
he
is
appointed






Well
and
then




asked
the
other
voice




If
before
that
you
are
not
ten
times
wounded

killed

or
betrayed

well



what
then










Well
then




Prince
Andrew
answered
himself




I
don


t
know
what
will
happen
and
don


t
want
to
know

and
can


t

but
if
I
want
this


want
glory

want
to
be
known
to
men

want
to
be
loved
by
them

it
is
not
my
fault
that
I
want
it
and
want
nothing
but
that
and
live
only
for
that

Yes

for
that
alone

I
shall
never
tell
anyone

but

oh
God

what
am
I
to
do
if
I
love
nothing
but
fame
and
men


s
esteem

Death

wounds

the
loss
of
family


I
fear
nothing

And
precious
and
dear
as
many
persons
are
to
me


father

sister

wife


those
dearest
to
me


yet
dreadful
and
unnatural
as
it
seems

I
would
give
them
all
at
once
for
a
moment
of
glory

of
triumph
over
men

of
love
from
men
I
don


t
know
and
never
shall
know

for
the
love
of
these
men
here




he
thought

as
he
listened
to
voices
in
Kut

zov


s
courtyard

The
voices
were
those
of
the
orderlies
who
were
packing
up

one
voice

probably
a
coachman


s

was
teasing
Kut

zov


s
old
cook
whom
Prince
Andrew
knew

and
who
was
called
Tit

He
was
saying




Tit

I
say

Tit








Well




returned
the
old
man





Go

Tit

thresh
a
bit




said
the
wag





Oh

go
to
the
devil




called
out
a
voice

drowned
by
the
laughter
of
the
orderlies
and
servants





All
the
same

I
love
and
value
nothing
but
triumph
over
them
all

I
value
this
mystic
power
and
glory
that
is
floating
here
above
me
in
this
mist









CHAPTER
XIII

That
same
night

Rost

v
was
with
a
platoon
on
skirmishing
duty
in
front
of
Bagrati

n


s
detachment

His
hussars
were
placed
along
the
line
in
couples
and
he
himself
rode
along
the
line
trying
to
master
the
sleepiness
that
kept
coming
over
him

An
enormous
space

with
our
army


s
campfires
dimly
glowing
in
the
fog

could
be
seen
behind
him

in
front
of
him
was
misty
darkness

Rost

v
could
see
nothing

peer
as
he
would
into
that
foggy
distance

now
something
gleamed
gray

now
there
was
something
black

now
little
lights
seemed
to
glimmer
where
the
enemy
ought
to
be

now
he
fancied
it
was
only
something
in
his
own
eyes

His
eyes
kept
closing

and
in
his
fancy
appeared


now
the
Emperor

now
Den

sov

and
now
Moscow
memories


and
he
again
hurriedly
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
close
before
him
the
head
and
ears
of
the
horse
he
was
riding

and
sometimes

when
he
came
within
six
paces
of
them

the
black
figures
of
hussars

but
in
the
distance
was
still
the
same
misty
darkness




Why
not




It
might
easily
happen




thought
Rost

v




that
the
Emperor
will
meet
me
and
give
me
an
order
as
he
would
to
any
other
officer

he


ll
say




Go
and
find
out
what


s
there




There
are
many
stories
of
his
getting
to
know
an
officer
in
just
such
a
chance
way
and
attaching
him
to
himself

What
if
he
gave
me
a
place
near
him

Oh

how
I
would
guard
him

how
I
would
tell
him
the
truth

how
I
would
unmask
his
deceivers




And
in
order
to
realize
vividly
his
love
devotion
to
the
sovereign

Rost

v
pictured
to
himself
an
enemy
or
a
deceitful
German

whom
he
would
not
only
kill
with
pleasure
but
whom
he
would
slap
in
the
face
before
the
Emperor

Suddenly
a
distant
shout
aroused
him

He
started
and
opened
his
eyes





Where
am
I

Oh
yes

in
the
skirmishing
line



pass
and
watchword


shaft

Olm

tz

What
a
nuisance
that
our
squadron
will
be
in
reserve
tomorrow




he
thought




I


ll
ask
leave
to
go
to
the
front

this
may
be
my
only
chance
of
seeing
the
Emperor

It
won


t
be
long
now
before
I
am
off
duty

I


ll
take
another
turn
and
when
I
get
back
I


ll
go
to
the
general
and
ask
him




He
readjusted
himself
in
the
saddle
and
touched
up
his
horse
to
ride
once
more
round
his
hussars

It
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
getting
lighter

To
the
left
he
saw
a
sloping
descent
lit
up

and
facing
it
a
black
knoll
that
seemed
as
steep
as
a
wall

On
this
knoll
there
was
a
white
patch
that
Rost

v
could
not
at
all
make
out

was
it
a
glade
in
the
wood
lit
up
by
the
moon

or
some
unmelted
snow

or
some
white
houses

He
even
thought
something
moved
on
that
white
spot




I
expect
it


s
snow



that
spot



a
spot


une
tache




he
thought




There
now



it


s
not
a
tache



Nat

sha



sister

black
eyes



Na



tasha




Won


t
she
be
surprised
when
I
tell
her
how
I


ve
seen
the
Emperor


Nat

sha



take
my
sabretache











Keep
to
the
right

your
honor

there
are
bushes
here




came
the
voice
of
an
hussar

past
whom
Rost

v
was
riding
in
the
act
of
falling
asleep

Rost

v
lifted
his
head
that
had
sunk
almost
to
his
horse


s
mane
and
pulled
up
beside
the
hussar

He
was
succumbing
to
irresistible

youthful

childish
drowsiness




But
what
was
I
thinking

I
mustn


t
forget

How
shall
I
speak
to
the
Emperor

No

that


s
not
it


that


s
tomorrow

Oh
yes

Nat

sha



sabretache



saber
them



Whom

The
hussars



Ah

the
hussars
with
mustaches

Along
the
Tversk

ya
Street
rode
the
hussar
with
mustaches



I
thought
about
him
too

just
opposite
G

ryev


s
house



Old
G

ryev




Oh

but
Den

sov


s
a
fine
fellow

But
that


s
all
nonsense

The
chief
thing
is
that
the
Emperor
is
here

How
he
looked
at
me
and
wished
to
say
something

but
dared
not




No

it
was
I
who
dared
not

But
that


s
nonsense

the
chief
thing
is
not
to
forget
the
important
thing
I
was
thinking
of

Yes

Na
t

sha

sabretache

oh

yes

yes

That


s
right




And
his
head
once
more
sank
to
his
horse


s
neck

All
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
being
fired
at




What

What

What




Cut
them
down

What







said
Rost

v

waking
up

At
the
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
he
heard
in
front
of
him

where
the
enemy
was

the
long
drawn
shouts
of
thousands
of
voices

His
horse
and
the
horse
of
the
hussar
near
him
pricked
their
ears
at
these
shouts

Over
there

where
the
shouting
came
from

a
fire
flared
up
and
went
out
again

then
another

and
all
along
the
French
line
on
the
hill
fires
flared
up
and
the
shouting
grew
louder
and
louder

Rost

v
could
hear
the
sound
of
French
words
but
could
not
distinguish
them

The
din
of
many
voices
was
too
great

all
he
could
hear
was




ahahah




and



rrrr








What


s
that

What
do
you
make
of
it




said
Rost

v
to
the
hussar
beside
him




That
must
be
the
enemy


s
camp





The
hussar
did
not
reply





Why

don


t
you
hear
it




Rost

v
asked
again

after
waiting
for
a
reply





Who
can
tell

your
honor




replied
the
hussar
reluctantly





From
the
direction

it
must
be
the
enemy




repeated
Rost

v





It
may
be
he
or
it
may
be
nothing




muttered
the
hussar




It


s
dark



Steady




he
cried
to
his
fidgeting
horse


Rost

v


s
horse
was
also
getting
restive

it
pawed
the
frozen
ground

pricking
its
ears
at
the
noise
and
looking
at
the
lights

The
shouting
grew
still
louder
and
merged
into
a
general
roar
that
only
an
army
of
several
thousand
men
could
produce

The
lights
spread
farther
and
farther

probably
along
the
line
of
the
French
camp

Rost

v
no
longer
wanted
to
sleep

The
gay
triumphant
shouting
of
the
enemy
army
had
a
stimulating
effect
on
him




Vive
l


Empereur

l


Empereur




he
now
heard
distinctly





They
can


t
be
far
off

probably
just
beyond
the
stream




he
said
to
the
hussar
beside
him


The
hussar
only
sighed
without
replying
and
coughed
angrily

The
sound
of
horse


s
hoofs
approaching
at
a
trot
along
the
line
of
hussars
was
heard

and
out
of
the
foggy
darkness
the
figure
of
a
sergeant
of
hussars
suddenly
appeared

looming
huge
as
an
elephant





Your
honor

the
generals




said
the
sergeant

riding
up
to
Rost

v


Rost

v

still
looking
round
toward
the
fires
and
the
shouts

rode
with
the
sergeant
to
meet
some
mounted
men
who
were
riding
along
the
line

One
was
on
a
white
horse

Prince
Bagrati

n
and
Prince
Dolgor

kov
with
their
adjutants
had
come
to
witness
the
curious
phenomenon
of
the
lights
and
shouts
in
the
enemy


s
camp

Rost

v
rode
up
to
Bagrati

n

reported
to
him

and
then
joined
the
adjutants
listening
to
what
the
generals
were
saying





Believe
me




said
Prince
Dolgor

kov

addressing
Bagrati

n




it
is
nothing
but
a
trick

He
has
retreated
and
ordered
the
rearguard
to
kindle
fires
and
make
a
noise
to
deceive
us








Hardly




said
Bagrati

n




I
saw
them
this
evening
on
that
knoll

if
they
had
retreated
they
would
have
withdrawn
from
that
too




Officer




said
Bagrati

n
to
Rost

v




are
the
enemy


s
skirmishers
still
there








They
were
there
this
evening

but
now
I
don


t
know

your
excellency

Shall
I
go
with
some
of
my
hussars
to
see




replied
Rost

v


Bagrati

n
stopped
and

before
replying

tried
to
see
Rost

v


s
face
in
the
mist





Well

go
and
see




he
said

after
a
pause





Yes

sir





Rost

v
spurred
his
horse

called
to
Sergeant
F

dchenko
and
two
other
hussars

told
them
to
follow
him

and
trotted
downhill
in
the
direction
from
which
the
shouting
came

He
felt
both
frightened
and
pleased
to
be
riding
alone
with
three
hussars
into
that
mysterious
and
dangerous
misty
distance
where
no
one
had
been
before
him

Bagrati

n
called
to
him
from
the
hill
not
to
go
beyond
the
stream

but
Rost

v
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
did
not
stop
but
rode
on
and
on

continually
mistaking
bushes
for
trees
and
gullies
for
men
and
continually
discovering
his
mistakes

Having
descended
the
hill
at
a
trot

he
no
longer
saw
either
our
own
or
the
enemy


s
fires

but
heard
the
shouting
of
the
French
more
loudly
and
distinctly

In
the
valley
he
saw
before
him
something
like
a
river

but
when
he
reached
it
he
found
it
was
a
road

Having
come
out
onto
the
road
he
reined
in
his
horse

hesitating
whether
to
ride
along
it
or
cross
it
and
ride
over
the
black
field
up
the
hillside

To
keep
to
the
road
which
gleamed
white
in
the
mist
would
have
been
safer
because
it
would
be
easier
to
see
people
coming
along
it




Follow
me




said
he

crossed
the
road

and
began
riding
up
the
hill
at
a
gallop
toward
the
point
where
the
French
pickets
had
been
standing
that
evening





Your
honor

there
he
is




cried
one
of
the
hussars
behind
him

And
before
Rost

v
had
time
to
make
out
what
the
black
thing
was
that
had
suddenly
appeared
in
the
fog

there
was
a
flash

followed
by
a
report

and
a
bullet
whizzing
high
up
in
the
mist
with
a
plaintive
sound
passed
out
of
hearing

Another
musket
missed
fire
but
flashed
in
the
pan

Rost

v
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back

Four
more
reports
followed
at
intervals

and
the
bullets
passed
somewhere
in
the
fog
singing
in
different
tones

Rost

v
reined
in
his
horse

whose
spirits
had
risen

like
his
own

at
the
firing

and
went
back
at
a
footpace




Well

some
more

Some
more




a
merry
voice
was
saying
in
his
soul

But
no
more
shots
came


Only
when
approaching
Bagrati

n
did
Rost

v
let
his
horse
gallop
again

and
with
his
hand
at
the
salute
rode
up
to
the
general


Dolgor

kov
was
still
insisting
that
the
French
had
retreated
and
had
only
lit
fires
to
deceive
us





What
does
that
prove




he
was
saying
as
Rost

v
rode
up




They
might
retreat
and
leave
the
pickets








It


s
plain
that
they
have
not
all
gone
yet

Prince




said
Bagrati

n




Wait
till
tomorrow
morning

we


ll
find
out
everything
tomorrow








The
picket
is
still
on
the
hill

your
excellency

just
where
it
was
in
the
evening




reported
Rost

v

stooping
forward
with
his
hand
at
the
salute
and
unable
to
repress
the
smile
of
delight
induced
by
his
ride
and
especially
by
the
sound
of
the
bullets





Very
good

very
good




said
Bagrati

n




Thank
you

officer








Your
excellency




said
Rost

v




may
I
ask
a
favor








What
is
it








Tomorrow
our
squadron
is
to
be
in
reserve

May
I
ask
to
be
attached
to
the
first
squadron








What


s
your
name








Count
Rost

v








Oh

very
well

you
may
stay
in
attendance
on
me








Count
Ily


Rost

v


s
son




asked
Dolgor

kov


But
Rost

v
did
not
reply





Then
I
may
reckon
on
it

your
excellency








I
will
give
the
order








Tomorrow
very
likely
I
may
be
sent
with
some
message
to
the
Emperor




thought
Rost

v





Thank
God





The
fires
and
shouting
in
the
enemy


s
army
were
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
while
Napoleon


s
proclamation
was
being
read
to
the
troops
the
Emperor
himself
rode
round
his
bivouacs

The
soldiers

on
seeing
him

lit
wisps
of
straw
and
ran
after
him

shouting




Vive
l


Empereur




Napoleon


s
proclamation
was
as
follows


Soldiers

The
Russian
army
is
advancing
against
you
to
avenge
the
Austrian
army
of
Ulm

They
are
the
same
battalions
you
broke
at
Hollabr

nn
and
have
pursued
ever
since
to
this
place

The
position
we
occupy
is
a
strong
one

and
while
they
are
marching
to
go
round
me
on
the
right
they
will
expose
a
flank
to
me

Soldiers

I
will
myself
direct
your
battalions

I
will
keep
out
of
fire
if
you
with
your
habitual
valor
carry
disorder
and
confusion
into
the
enemy


s
ranks

but
should
victory
be
in
doubt

even
for
a
moment

you
will
see
your
Emperor
exposing
himself
to
the
first
blows
of
the
enemy

for
there
must
be
no
doubt
of
victory

especially
on
this
day
when
what
is
at
stake
is
the
honor
of
the
French
infantry

so
necessary
to
the
honor
of
our
nation


Do
not
break
your
ranks
on
the
plea
of
removing
the
wounded

Let
every
man
be
fully
imbued
with
the
thought
that
we
must
defeat
these
hirelings
of
England

inspired
by
such
hatred
of
our
nation

This
victory
will
conclude
our
campaign
and
we
can
return
to
winter
quarters

where
fresh
French
troops
who
are
being
raised
in
France
will
join
us

and
the
peace
I
shall
conclude
will
be
worthy
of
my
people

of
you

and
of
myself


NAPOLEON




CHAPTER
XIV

At
five
in
the
morning
it
was
still
quite
dark

The
troops
of
the
center

the
reserves

and
Bagrati

n


s
right
flank
had
not
yet
moved

but
on
the
left
flank
the
columns
of
infantry

cavalry

and
artillery

which
were
to
be
the
first
to
descend
the
heights
to
attack
the
French
right
flank
and
drive
it
into
the
Bohemian
mountains
according
to
plan

were
already
up
and
astir

The
smoke
of
the
campfires

into
which
they
were
throwing
everything
superfluous

made
the
eyes
smart

It
was
cold
and
dark

The
officers
were
hurriedly
drinking
tea
and
breakfasting

the
soldiers

munching
biscuit
and
beating
a
tattoo
with
their
feet
to
warm
themselves

gathering
round
the
fires
throwing
into
the
flames
the
remains
of
sheds

chairs

tables

wheels

tubs

and
everything
that
they
did
not
want
or
could
not
carry
away
with
them

Austrian
column
guides
were
moving
in
and
out
among
the
Russian
troops
and
served
as
heralds
of
the
advance

As
soon
as
an
Austrian
officer
showed
himself
near
a
commanding
officer


s
quarters

the
regiment
began
to
move

the
soldiers
ran
from
the
fires

thrust
their
pipes
into
their
boots

their
bags
into
the
carts

got
their
muskets
ready

and
formed
rank

The
officers
buttoned
up
their
coats

buckled
on
their
swords
and
pouches

and
moved
along
the
ranks
shouting

The
train
drivers
and
orderlies
harnessed
and
packed
the
wagons
and
tied
on
the
loads

The
adjutants
and
battalion
and
regimental
commanders
mounted

crossed
themselves

gave
final
instructions

orders

and
commissions
to
the
baggage
men
who
remained
behind

and
the
monotonous
tramp
of
thousands
of
feet
resounded

The
column
moved
forward
without
knowing
where
and
unable

from
the
masses
around
them

the
smoke
and
the
increasing
fog

to
see
either
the
place
they
were
leaving
or
that
to
which
they
were
going


A
soldier
on
the
march
is
hemmed
in
and
borne
along
by
his
regiment
as
much
as
a
sailor
is
by
his
ship

However
far
he
has
walked

whatever
strange

unknown

and
dangerous
places
he
reaches

just
as
a
sailor
is
always
surrounded
by
the
same
decks

masts

and
rigging
of
his
ship

so
the
soldier
always
has
around
him
the
same
comrades

the
same
ranks

the
same
sergeant
major
Iv

n
M

trich

the
same
company
dog
Jack

and
the
same
commanders

The
sailor
rarely
cares
to
know
the
latitude
in
which
his
ship
is
sailing

but
on
the
day
of
battle


heaven
knows
how
and
whence


a
stern
note
of
which
all
are
conscious
sounds
in
the
moral
atmosphere
of
an
army

announcing
the
approach
of
something
decisive
and
solemn

and
awakening
in
the
men
an
unusual
curiosity

On
the
day
of
battle
the
soldiers
excitedly
try
to
get
beyond
the
interests
of
their
regiment

they
listen
intently

look
about

and
eagerly
ask
concerning
what
is
going
on
around
them


The
fog
had
grown
so
dense
that
though
it
was
growing
light
they
could
not
see
ten
paces
ahead

Bushes
looked
like
gigantic
trees
and
level
ground
like
cliffs
and
slopes

Anywhere

on
any
side

one
might
encounter
an
enemy
invisible
ten
paces
off

But
the
columns
advanced
for
a
long
time

always
in
the
same
fog

descending
and
ascending
hills

avoiding
gardens
and
enclosures

going
over
new
and
unknown
ground

and
nowhere
encountering
the
enemy

On
the
contrary

the
soldiers
became
aware
that
in
front

behind

and
on
all
sides

other
Russian
columns
were
moving
in
the
same
direction

Every
soldier
felt
glad
to
know
that
to
the
unknown
place
where
he
was
going

many
more
of
our
men
were
going
too





There
now

the
K

rskies
have
also
gone
past




was
being
said
in
the
ranks





It


s
wonderful
what
a
lot
of
our
troops
have
gathered

lads

Last
night
I
looked
at
the
campfires
and
there
was
no
end
of
them

A
regular
Moscow





Though
none
of
the
column
commanders
rode
up
to
the
ranks
or
talked
to
the
men

the
commanders

as
we
saw
at
the
council
of
war

were
out
of
humor
and
dissatisfied
with
the
affair

and
so
did
not
exert
themselves
to
cheer
the
men
but
merely
carried
out
the
orders


yet
the
troops
marched
gaily

as
they
always
do
when
going
into
action

especially
to
an
attack

But
when
they
had
marched
for
about
an
hour
in
the
dense
fog

the
greater
part
of
the
men
had
to
halt
and
an
unpleasant
consciousness
of
some
dislocation
and
blunder
spread
through
the
ranks

How
such
a
consciousness
is
communicated
is
very
difficult
to
define

but
it
certainly
is
communicated
very
surely

and
flows
rapidly

imperceptibly

and
irrepressibly

as
water
does
in
a
creek

Had
the
Russian
army
been
alone
without
any
allies

it
might
perhaps
have
been
a
long
time
before
this
consciousness
of
mismanagement
became
a
general
conviction

but
as
it
was

the
disorder
was
readily
and
naturally
attributed
to
the
stupid
Germans

and
everyone
was
convinced
that
a
dangerous
muddle
had
been
occasioned
by
the
sausage
eaters





Why
have
we
stopped

Is
the
way
blocked

Or
have
we
already
come
up
against
the
French








No

one
can


t
hear
them

They


d
be
firing
if
we
had








They
were
in
a
hurry
enough
to
start
us

and
now
here
we
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
field
without
rhyme
or
reason

It


s
all
those
damned
Germans



muddling

What
stupid
devils








Yes

I


d
send
them
on
in
front

but
no
fear

they


re
crowding
up
behind

And
now
here
we
stand
hungry








I
say

shall
we
soon
be
clear

They
say
the
cavalry
are
blocking
the
way




said
an
officer





Ah

those
damned
Germans

They
don


t
know
their
own
country




said
another





What
division
are
you




shouted
an
adjutant

riding
up





The
Eighteenth








Then
why
are
you
here

You
should
have
gone
on
long
ago

now
you
won


t
get
there
till
evening








What
stupid
orders

They
don


t
themselves
know
what
they
are
doing




said
the
officer
and
rode
off


Then
a
general
rode
past
shouting
something
angrily

not
in
Russian





Tafa
lafa

But
what
he


s
jabbering
no
one
can
make
out




said
a
soldier

mimicking
the
general
who
had
ridden
away




I


d
shoot
them

the
scoundrels








We
were
ordered
to
be
at
the
place
before
nine

but
we
haven


t
got
halfway

Fine
orders




was
being
repeated
on
different
sides


And
the
feeling
of
energy
with
which
the
troops
had
started
began
to
turn
into
vexation
and
anger
at
the
stupid
arrangements
and
at
the
Germans


The
cause
of
the
confusion
was
that
while
the
Austrian
cavalry
was
moving
toward
our
left
flank

the
higher
command
found
that
our
center
was
too
far
separated
from
our
right
flank
and
the
cavalry
were
all
ordered
to
turn
back
to
the
right

Several
thousand
cavalry
crossed
in
front
of
the
infantry

who
had
to
wait


At
the
front
an
altercation
occurred
between
an
Austrian
guide
and
a
Russian
general

The
general
shouted
a
demand
that
the
cavalry
should
be
halted

the
Austrian
argued
that
not
he

but
the
higher
command

was
to
blame

The
troops
meanwhile
stood
growing
listless
and
dispirited

After
an
hour


s
delay
they
at
last
moved
on

descending
the
hill

The
fog
that
was
dispersing
on
the
hill
lay
still
more
densely
below

where
they
were
descending

In
front
in
the
fog
a
shot
was
heard
and
then
another

at
first
irregularly
at
varying
intervals


trata


tat


and
then
more
and
more
regularly
and
rapidly

and
the
action
at
the
Goldbach
Stream
began


Not
expecting
to
come
on
the
enemy
down
by
the
stream

and
having
stumbled
on
him
in
the
fog

hearing
no
encouraging
word
from
their
commanders

and
with
a
consciousness
of
being
too
late
spreading
through
the
ranks

and
above
all
being
unable
to
see
anything
in
front
or
around
them
in
the
thick
fog

the
Russians
exchanged
shots
with
the
enemy
lazily
and
advanced
and
again
halted

receiving
no
timely
orders
from
the
officers
or
adjutants
who
wandered
about
in
the
fog
in
those
unknown
surroundings
unable
to
find
their
own
regiments

In
this
way
the
action
began
for
the
first

second

and
third
columns

which
had
gone
down
into
the
valley

The
fourth
column

with
which
Kut

zov
was

stood
on
the
Pratzen
Heights


Below

where
the
fight
was
beginning

there
was
still
thick
fog

on
the
higher
ground
it
was
clearing

but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
what
was
going
on
in
front

Whether
all
the
enemy
forces
were

as
we
supposed

six
miles
away

or
whether
they
were
near
by
in
that
sea
of
mist

no
one
knew
till
after
eight
o


clock


It
was
nine
o


clock
in
the
morning

The
fog
lay
unbroken
like
a
sea
down
below

but
higher
up
at
the
village
of
Schlappanitz
where
Napoleon
stood
with
his
marshals
around
him

it
was
quite
light

Above
him
was
a
clear
blue
sky

and
the
sun


s
vast
orb
quivered
like
a
huge
hollow

crimson
float
on
the
surface
of
that
milky
sea
of
mist

The
whole
French
army

and
even
Napoleon
himself
with
his
staff

were
not
on
the
far
side
of
the
streams
and
hollows
of
Sokolnitz
and
Schlappanitz
beyond
which
we
intended
to
take
up
our
position
and
begin
the
action

but
were
on
this
side

so
close
to
our
own
forces
that
Napoleon
with
the
naked
eye
could
distinguish
a
mounted
man
from
one
on
foot

Napoleon

in
the
blue
cloak
which
he
had
worn
on
his
Italian
campaign

sat
on
his
small
gray
Arab
horse
a
little
in
front
of
his
marshals

He
gazed
silently
at
the
hills
which
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
sea
of
mist
and
on
which
the
Russian
troops
were
moving
in
the
distance

and
he
listened
to
the
sounds
of
firing
in
the
valley

Not
a
single
muscle
of
his
face


which
in
those
days
was
still
thin


moved

His
gleaming
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
one
spot

His
predictions
were
being
justified

Part
of
the
Russian
force
had
already
descended
into
the
valley
toward
the
ponds
and
lakes
and
part
were
leaving
these
Pratzen
Heights
which
he
intended
to
attack
and
regarded
as
the
key
to
the
position

He
saw
over
the
mist
that
in
a
hollow
between
two
hills
near
the
village
of
Pratzen

the
Russian
columns

their
bayonets
glittering

were
moving
continuously
in
one
direction
toward
the
valley
and
disappearing
one
after
another
into
the
mist

From
information
he
had
received
the
evening
before

from
the
sound
of
wheels
and
footsteps
heard
by
the
outposts
during
the
night

by
the
disorderly
movement
of
the
Russian
columns

and
from
all
indications

he
saw
clearly
that
the
allies
believed
him
to
be
far
away
in
front
of
them

and
that
the
columns
moving
near
Pratzen
constituted
the
center
of
the
Russian
army

and
that
that
center
was
already
sufficiently
weakened
to
be
successfully
attacked

But
still
he
did
not
begin
the
engagement


Today
was
a
great
day
for
him


the
anniversary
of
his
coronation

Before
dawn
he
had
slept
for
a
few
hours

and
refreshed

vigorous

and
in
good
spirits

he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
out
into
the
field
in
that
happy
mood
in
which
everything
seems
possible
and
everything
succeeds

He
sat
motionless

looking
at
the
heights
visible
above
the
mist

and
his
cold
face
wore
that
special
look
of
confident

self
complacent
happiness
that
one
sees
on
the
face
of
a
boy
happily
in
love

The
marshals
stood
behind
him
not
venturing
to
distract
his
attention

He
looked
now
at
the
Pratzen
Heights

now
at
the
sun
floating
up
out
of
the
mist


When
the
sun
had
entirely
emerged
from
the
fog

and
fields
and
mist
were
aglow
with
dazzling
light


as
if
he
had
only
awaited
this
to
begin
the
action


he
drew
the
glove
from
his
shapely
white
hand

made
a
sign
with
it
to
the
marshals

and
ordered
the
action
to
begin

The
marshals

accompanied
by
adjutants

galloped
off
in
different
directions

and
a
few
minutes
later
the
chief
forces
of
the
French
army
moved
rapidly
toward
those
Pratzen
Heights
which
were
being
more
and
more
denuded
by
Russian
troops
moving
down
the
valley
to
their
left






CHAPTER
XV

At
eight
o


clock
Kut

zov
rode
to
Pratzen
at
the
head
of
the
fourth
column

Milor

dovich


s

the
one
that
was
to
take
the
place
of
Przebysz

wski


s
and
Langeron


s
columns
which
had
already
gone
down
into
the
valley

He
greeted
the
men
of
the
foremost
regiment
and
gave
them
the
order
to
march

thereby
indicating
that
he
intended
to
lead
that
column
himself

When
he
had
reached
the
village
of
Pratzen
he
halted

Prince
Andrew
was
behind

among
the
immense
number
forming
the
commander
in
chief


s
suite

He
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
and
irritation

though
controlledly
calm
as
a
man
is
at
the
approach
of
a
long
awaited
moment

He
was
firmly
convinced
that
this
was
the
day
of
his
Toulon

or
his
bridge
of
Arcola

How
it
would
come
about
he
did
not
know

but
he
felt
sure
it
would
do
so

The
locality
and
the
position
of
our
troops
were
known
to
him
as
far
as
they
could
be
known
to
anyone
in
our
army

His
own
strategic
plan

which
obviously
could
not
now
be
carried
out

was
forgotten

Now

entering
into
Weyrother


s
plan

Prince
Andrew
considered
possible
contingencies
and
formed
new
projects
such
as
might
call
for
his
rapidity
of
perception
and
decision


To
the
left
down
below
in
the
mist

the
musketry
fire
of
unseen
forces
could
be
heard

It
was
there
Prince
Andrew
thought
the
fight
would
concentrate




There
we
shall
encounter
difficulties

and
there




thought
he




I
shall
be
sent
with
a
brigade
or
division

and
there

standard
in
hand

I
shall
go
forward
and
break
whatever
is
in
front
of
me





He
could
not
look
calmly
at
the
standards
of
the
passing
battalions

Seeing
them
he
kept
thinking




That
may
be
the
very
standard
with
which
I
shall
lead
the
army





In
the
morning
all
that
was
left
of
the
night
mist
on
the
heights
was
a
hoar
frost
now
turning
to
dew

but
in
the
valleys
it
still
lay
like
a
milk
white
sea

Nothing
was
visible
in
the
valley
to
the
left
into
which
our
troops
had
descended
and
from
whence
came
the
sounds
of
firing

Above
the
heights
was
the
dark
clear
sky

and
to
the
right
the
vast
orb
of
the
sun

In
front

far
off
on
the
farther
shore
of
that
sea
of
mist

some
wooded
hills
were
discernible

and
it
was
there
the
enemy
probably
was

for
something
could
be
descried

On
the
right
the
Guards
were
entering
the
misty
region
with
a
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
and
now
and
then
a
gleam
of
bayonets

to
the
left
beyond
the
village
similar
masses
of
cavalry
came
up
and
disappeared
in
the
sea
of
mist

In
front
and
behind
moved
infantry

The
commander
in
chief
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
village
letting
the
troops
pass
by
him

That
morning
Kut

zov
seemed
worn
and
irritable

The
infantry
passing
before
him
came
to
a
halt
without
any
command
being
given

apparently
obstructed
by
something
in
front





Do
order
them
to
form
into
battalion
columns
and
go
round
the
village




he
said
angrily
to
a
general
who
had
ridden
up




Don


t
you
understand

your
excellency

my
dear
sir

that
you
must
not
defile
through
narrow
village
streets
when
we
are
marching
against
the
enemy








I
intended
to
re
form
them
beyond
the
village

your
excellency




answered
the
general


Kut

zov
laughed
bitterly





You


ll
make
a
fine
thing
of
it

deploying
in
sight
of
the
enemy

Very
fine








The
enemy
is
still
far
away

your
excellency

According
to
the
dispositions










The
dispositions




exclaimed
Kut

zov
bitterly




Who
told
you
that




Kindly
do
as
you
are
ordered








Yes

sir








My
dear
fellow




Nesv

tski
whispered
to
Prince
Andrew




the
old
man
is
as
surly
as
a
dog





An
Austrian
officer
in
a
white
uniform
with
green
plumes
in
his
hat
galloped
up
to
Kut

zov
and
asked
in
the
Emperor


s
name
had
the
fourth
column
advanced
into
action


Kut

zov
turned
round
without
answering
and
his
eye
happened
to
fall
upon
Prince
Andrew

who
was
beside
him

Seeing
him

Kut

zov


s
malevolent
and
caustic
expression
softened

as
if
admitting
that
what
was
being
done
was
not
his
adjutant


s
fault

and
still
not
answering
the
Austrian
adjutant

he
addressed
Bolk

nski





Go

my
dear
fellow

and
see
whether
the
third
division
has
passed
the
village

Tell
it
to
stop
and
await
my
orders





Hardly
had
Prince
Andrew
started
than
he
stopped
him





And
ask
whether
sharpshooters
have
been
posted




he
added




What
are
they
doing

What
are
they
doing




he
murmured
to
himself

still
not
replying
to
the
Austrian


Prince
Andrew
galloped
off
to
execute
the
order


Overtaking
the
battalions
that
continued
to
advance

he
stopped
the
third
division
and
convinced
himself
that
there
really
were
no
sharpshooters
in
front
of
our
columns

The
colonel
at
the
head
of
the
regiment
was
much
surprised
at
the
commander
in
chief


s
order
to
throw
out
skirmishers

He
had
felt
perfectly
sure
that
there
were
other
troops
in
front
of
him
and
that
the
enemy
must
be
at
least
six
miles
away

There
was
really
nothing
to
be
seen
in
front
except
a
barren
descent
hidden
by
dense
mist

Having
given
orders
in
the
commander
in
chief


s
name
to
rectify
this
omission

Prince
Andrew
galloped
back

Kut

zov
still
in
the
same
place

his
stout
body
resting
heavily
in
the
saddle
with
the
lassitude
of
age

sat
yawning
wearily
with
closed
eyes

The
troops
were
no
longer
moving

but
stood
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
on
the
ground





All
right

all
right




he
said
to
Prince
Andrew

and
turned
to
a
general
who

watch
in
hand

was
saying
it
was
time
they
started
as
all
the
left
flank
columns
had
already
descended





Plenty
of
time

your
excellency




muttered
Kut

zov
in
the
midst
of
a
yawn




Plenty
of
time




he
repeated


Just
then
at
a
distance
behind
Kut

zov
was
heard
the
sound
of
regiments
saluting

and
this
sound
rapidly
came
nearer
along
the
whole
extended
line
of
the
advancing
Russian
columns

Evidently
the
person
they
were
greeting
was
riding
quickly

When
the
soldiers
of
the
regiment
in
front
of
which
Kut

zov
was
standing
began
to
shout

he
rode
a
little
to
one
side
and
looked
round
with
a
frown

Along
the
road
from
Pratzen
galloped
what
looked
like
a
squadron
of
horsemen
in
various
uniforms

Two
of
them
rode
side
by
side
in
front

at
full
gallop

One
in
a
black
uniform
with
white
plumes
in
his
hat
rode
a
bobtailed
chestnut
horse

the
other
who
was
in
a
white
uniform
rode
a
black
one

These
were
the
two
Emperors
followed
by
their
suites

Kut

zov

affecting
the
manners
of
an
old
soldier
at
the
front

gave
the
command



Attention




and
rode
up
to
the
Emperors
with
a
salute

His
whole
appearance
and
manner
were
suddenly
transformed

He
put
on
the
air
of
a
subordinate
who
obeys
without
reasoning

With
an
affectation
of
respect
which
evidently
struck
Alexander
unpleasantly

he
rode
up
and
saluted


This
unpleasant
impression
merely
flitted
over
the
young
and
happy
face
of
the
Emperor
like
a
cloud
of
haze
across
a
clear
sky
and
vanished

After
his
illness
he
looked
rather
thinner
that
day
than
on
the
field
of
Olm

tz
where
Bolk

nski
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
abroad

but
there
was
still
the
same
bewitching
combination
of
majesty
and
mildness
in
his
fine
gray
eyes

and
on
his
delicate
lips
the
same
capacity
for
varying
expression
and
the
same
prevalent
appearance
of
goodhearted
innocent
youth


At
the
Olm

tz
review
he
had
seemed
more
majestic

here
he
seemed
brighter
and
more
energetic

He
was
slightly
flushed
after
galloping
two
miles

and
reining
in
his
horse
he
sighed
restfully
and
looked
round
at
the
faces
of
his
suite

young
and
animated
as
his
own

Czartor

ski

Novos

ltsev

Prince
Volk

nsky

Str

gonov

and
the
others

all
richly
dressed
gay
young
men
on
splendid

well
groomed

fresh

only
slightly
heated
horses

exchanging
remarks
and
smiling

had
stopped
behind
the
Emperor

The
Emperor
Francis

a
rosy

long
faced
young
man

sat
very
erect
on
his
handsome
black
horse

looking
about
him
in
a
leisurely
and
preoccupied
manner

He
beckoned
to
one
of
his
white
adjutants
and
asked
some
question





Most
likely
he
is
asking
at
what
o


clock
they
started




thought
Prince
Andrew

watching
his
old
acquaintance
with
a
smile
he
could
not
repress
as
he
recalled
his
reception
at
Br

nn

In
the
Emperors



suite
were
the
picked
young
orderly
officers
of
the
Guard
and
line
regiments

Russian
and
Austrian

Among
them
were
grooms
leading
the
Tsar


s
beautiful
relay
horses
covered
with
embroidered
cloths


As
when
a
window
is
opened
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
from
the
fields
enters
a
stuffy
room

so
a
whiff
of
youthfulness

energy

and
confidence
of
success
reached
Kut

zov


s
cheerless
staff
with
the
galloping
advent
of
all
these
brilliant
young
men





Why
aren


t
you
beginning

Michael
Ilari

novich




said
the
Emperor
Alexander
hurriedly
to
Kut

zov

glancing
courteously
at
the
same
time
at
the
Emperor
Francis





I
am
waiting

Your
Majesty




answered
Kut

zov

bending
forward
respectfully


The
Emperor

frowning
slightly

bent
his
ear
forward
as
if
he
had
not
quite
heard





Waiting

Your
Majesty




repeated
Kut

zov


Prince
Andrew
noted
that
Kut

zov


s
upper
lip
twitched
unnaturally
as
he
said
the
word



waiting








Not
all
the
columns
have
formed
up
yet

Your
Majesty





The
Tsar
heard
but
obviously
did
not
like
the
reply

he
shrugged
his
rather
round
shoulders
and
glanced
at
Novos

ltsev
who
was
near
him

as
if
complaining
of
Kut

zov





You
know

Michael
Ilari

novich

we
are
not
on
the
Empress



Field
where
a
parade
does
not
begin
till
all
the
troops
are
assembled




said
the
Tsar
with
another
glance
at
the
Emperor
Francis

as
if
inviting
him
if
not
to
join
in
at
least
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying

But
the
Emperor
Francis
continued
to
look
about
him
and
did
not
listen





That
is
just
why
I
do
not
begin

sire




said
Kut

zov
in
a
resounding
voice

apparently
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
not
being
heard

and
again
something
in
his
face
twitched





That
is
just
why
I
do
not
begin

sire

because
we
are
not
on
parade
and
not
on
the
Empress



Field




said
he
clearly
and
distinctly


In
the
Emperor


s
suite
all
exchanged
rapid
looks
that
expressed
dissatisfaction
and
reproach




Old
though
he
may
be

he
should
not

he
certainly
should
not

speak
like
that




their
glances
seemed
to
say


The
Tsar
looked
intently
and
observantly
into
Kut

zov


s
eye
waiting
to
hear
whether
he
would
say
anything
more

But
Kut

zov

with
respectfully
bowed
head

seemed
also
to
be
waiting

The
silence
lasted
for
about
a
minute





However

if
you
command
it

Your
Majesty




said
Kut

zov

lifting
his
head
and
again
assuming
his
former
tone
of
a
dull

unreasoning

but
submissive
general


He
touched
his
horse
and
having
called
Milor

dovich

the
commander
of
the
column

gave
him
the
order
to
advance


The
troops
again
began
to
move

and
two
battalions
of
the
N

vgorod
and
one
of
the


psheron
regiment
went
forward
past
the
Emperor


As
this


psheron
battalion
marched
by

the
red
faced
Milor

dovich

without
his
greatcoat

with
his
Orders
on
his
breast
and
an
enormous
tuft
of
plumes
in
his
cocked
hat
worn
on
one
side
with
its
corners
front
and
back

galloped
strenuously
forward

and
with
a
dashing
salute
reined
in
his
horse
before
the
Emperor





God
be
with
you

general




said
the
Emperor





Ma
foi

sire

nous
ferons
ce
qui
sera
dans
notre
possibilit



sire






he
answered
gaily

raising
nevertheless
ironic
smiles
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
Tsar


s
suite
by
his
poor
French












Indeed

Sire

we
shall
do
everything
it
is
possible
to





do

Sire






Milor

dovich
wheeled
his
horse
sharply
and
stationed
himself
a
little
behind
the
Emperor

The


psheron
men

excited
by
the
Tsar


s
presence

passed
in
step
before
the
Emperors
and
their
suites
at
a
bold

brisk
pace





Lads




shouted
Milor

dovich
in
a
loud

self
confident

and
cheery
voice

obviously
so
elated
by
the
sound
of
firing

by
the
prospect
of
battle

and
by
the
sight
of
the
gallant


psherons

his
comrades
in
Suv

rov


s
time

now
passing
so
gallantly
before
the
Emperors

that
he
forgot
the
sovereigns



presence




Lads

it


s
not
the
first
village
you


ve
had
to
take




cried
he





Glad
to
do
our
best




shouted
the
soldiers


The
Emperor


s
horse
started
at
the
sudden
cry

This
horse
that
had
carried
the
sovereign
at
reviews
in
Russia
bore
him
also
here
on
the
field
of
Austerlitz

enduring
the
heedless
blows
of
his
left
foot
and
pricking
its
ears
at
the
sound
of
shots
just
as
it
had
done
on
the
Empress



Field

not
understanding
the
significance
of
the
firing

nor
of
the
nearness
of
the
Emperor
Francis



black
cob

nor
of
all
that
was
being
said

thought

and
felt
that
day
by
its
rider


The
Emperor
turned
with
a
smile
to
one
of
his
followers
and
made
a
remark
to
him

pointing
to
the
gallant


psherons






CHAPTER
XVI

Kut

zov
accompanied
by
his
adjutants
rode
at
a
walking
pace
behind
the
carabineers


When
he
had
gone
less
than
half
a
mile
in
the
rear
of
the
column
he
stopped
at
a
solitary

deserted
house
that
had
probably
once
been
an
inn

where
two
roads
parted

Both
of
them
led
downhill
and
troops
were
marching
along
both


The
fog
had
begun
to
clear
and
enemy
troops
were
already
dimly
visible
about
a
mile
and
a
half
off
on
the
opposite
heights

Down
below

on
the
left

the
firing
became
more
distinct

Kut

zov
had
stopped
and
was
speaking
to
an
Austrian
general

Prince
Andrew

who
was
a
little
behind
looking
at
them

turned
to
an
adjutant
to
ask
him
for
a
field
glass





Look

look




said
this
adjutant

looking
not
at
the
troops
in
the
distance

but
down
the
hill
before
him




It


s
the
French





The
two
generals
and
the
adjutant
took
hold
of
the
field
glass

trying
to
snatch
it
from
one
another

The
expression
on
all
their
faces
suddenly
changed
to
one
of
horror

The
French
were
supposed
to
be
a
mile
and
a
half
away

but
had
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
appeared
just
in
front
of
us





It


s
the
enemy




No




Yes

see
it
is




for
certain




But
how
is
that




said
different
voices


With
the
naked
eye
Prince
Andrew
saw
below
them
to
the
right

not
more
than
five
hundred
paces
from
where
Kut

zov
was
standing

a
dense
French
column
coming
up
to
meet
the


psherons





Here
it
is

The
decisive
moment
has
arrived

My
turn
has
come




thought
Prince
Andrew

and
striking
his
horse
he
rode
up
to
Kut

zov





The


psherons
must
be
stopped

your
excellency




cried
he

But
at
that
very
instant
a
cloud
of
smoke
spread
all
round

firing
was
heard
quite
close
at
hand

and
a
voice
of
na

ve
terror
barely
two
steps
from
Prince
Andrew
shouted




Brothers

All


s
lost




And
at
this
as
if
at
a
command

everyone
began
to
run


Confused
and
ever
increasing
crowds
were
running
back
to
where
five
minutes
before
the
troops
had
passed
the
Emperors

Not
only
would
it
have
been
difficult
to
stop
that
crowd

it
was
even
impossible
not
to
be
carried
back
with
it
oneself

Bolk

nski
only
tried
not
to
lose
touch
with
it

and
looked
around
bewildered
and
unable
to
grasp
what
was
happening
in
front
of
him

Nesv

tski
with
an
angry
face

red
and
unlike
himself

was
shouting
to
Kut

zov
that
if
he
did
not
ride
away
at
once
he
would
certainly
be
taken
prisoner

Kut

zov
remained
in
the
same
place
and
without
answering
drew
out
a
handkerchief

Blood
was
flowing
from
his
cheek

Prince
Andrew
forced
his
way
to
him





You
are
wounded




he
asked

hardly
able
to
master
the
trembling
of
his
lower
jaw





The
wound
is
not
here

it
is
there




said
Kut

zov

pressing
the
handkerchief
to
his
wounded
cheek
and
pointing
to
the
fleeing
soldiers




Stop
them




he
shouted

and
at
the
same
moment

probably
realizing
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
them

spurred
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
right


A
fresh
wave
of
the
flying
mob
caught
him
and
bore
him
back
with
it


The
troops
were
running
in
such
a
dense
mass
that
once
surrounded
by
them
it
was
difficult
to
get
out
again

One
was
shouting




Get
on

Why
are
you
hindering
us




Another
in
the
same
place
turned
round
and
fired
in
the
air

a
third
was
striking
the
horse
Kut

zov
himself
rode

Having
by
a
great
effort
got
away
to
the
left
from
that
flood
of
men

Kut

zov

with
his
suite
diminished
by
more
than
half

rode
toward
a
sound
of
artillery
fire
near
by

Having
forced
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
of
fugitives

Prince
Andrew

trying
to
keep
near
Kut

zov

saw
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
amid
the
smoke
a
Russian
battery
that
was
still
firing
and
Frenchmen
running
toward
it

Higher
up
stood
some
Russian
infantry

neither
moving
forward
to
protect
the
battery
nor
backward
with
the
fleeing
crowd

A
mounted
general
separated
himself
from
the
infantry
and
approached
Kut

zov

Of
Kut

zov


s
suite
only
four
remained

They
were
all
pale
and
exchanged
looks
in
silence





Stop
those
wretches




gasped
Kut

zov
to
the
regimental
commander

pointing
to
the
flying
soldiers

but
at
that
instant

as
if
to
punish
him
for
those
words

bullets
flew
hissing
across
the
regiment
and
across
Kut

zov


s
suite
like
a
flock
of
little
birds


The
French
had
attacked
the
battery
and

seeing
Kut

zov

were
firing
at
him

After
this
volley
the
regimental
commander
clutched
at
his
leg

several
soldiers
fell

and
a
second
lieutenant
who
was
holding
the
flag
let
it
fall
from
his
hands

It
swayed
and
fell

but
caught
on
the
muskets
of
the
nearest
soldiers

The
soldiers
started
firing
without
orders





Oh

Oh

Oh




groaned
Kut

zov
despairingly
and
looked
around







Bolk

nski




he
whispered

his
voice
trembling
from
a
consciousness
of
the
feebleness
of
age




Bolk

nski




he
whispered

pointing
to
the
disordered
battalion
and
at
the
enemy




what


s
that





But
before
he
had
finished
speaking

Prince
Andrew

feeling
tears
of
shame
and
anger
choking
him

had
already
leapt
from
his
horse
and
run
to
the
standard





Forward

lads




he
shouted
in
a
voice
piercing
as
a
child


s





Here
it
is




thought
he

seizing
the
staff
of
the
standard
and
hearing
with
pleasure
the
whistle
of
bullets
evidently
aimed
at
him

Several
soldiers
fell





Hurrah




shouted
Prince
Andrew

and

scarcely
able
to
hold
up
the
heavy
standard

he
ran
forward
with
full
confidence
that
the
whole
battalion
would
follow
him


And
really
he
only
ran
a
few
steps
alone

One
soldier
moved
and
then
another
and
soon
the
whole
battalion
ran
forward
shouting



Hurrah




and
overtook
him

A
sergeant
of
the
battalion
ran
up
and
took
the
flag
that
was
swaying
from
its
weight
in
Prince
Andrew


s
hands

but
he
was
immediately
killed

Prince
Andrew
again
seized
the
standard
and

dragging
it
by
the
staff

ran
on
with
the
battalion

In
front
he
saw
our
artillerymen

some
of
whom
were
fighting

while
others

having
abandoned
their
guns

were
running
toward
him

He
also
saw
French
infantry
soldiers
who
were
seizing
the
artillery
horses
and
turning
the
guns
round

Prince
Andrew
and
the
battalion
were
already
within
twenty
paces
of
the
cannon

He
heard
the
whistle
of
bullets
above
him
unceasingly
and
to
right
and
left
of
him
soldiers
continually
groaned
and
dropped

But
he
did
not
look
at
them

he
looked
only
at
what
was
going
on
in
front
of
him


at
the
battery

He
now
saw
clearly
the
figure
of
a
red
haired
gunner
with
his
shako
knocked
awry

pulling
one
end
of
a
mop
while
a
French
soldier
tugged
at
the
other

He
could
distinctly
see
the
distraught
yet
angry
expression
on
the
faces
of
these
two
men

who
evidently
did
not
realize
what
they
were
doing





What
are
they
about




thought
Prince
Andrew
as
he
gazed
at
them




Why
doesn


t
the
red
haired
gunner
run
away
as
he
is
unarmed

Why
doesn


t
the
Frenchman
stab
him

He
will
not
get
away
before
the
Frenchman
remembers
his
bayonet
and
stabs
him








And
really
another
French
soldier

trailing
his
musket

ran
up
to
the
struggling
men

and
the
fate
of
the
red
haired
gunner

who
had
triumphantly
secured
the
mop
and
still
did
not
realize
what
awaited
him

was
about
to
be
decided

But
Prince
Andrew
did
not
see
how
it
ended

It
seemed
to
him
as
though
one
of
the
soldiers
near
him
hit
him
on
the
head
with
the
full
swing
of
a
bludgeon

It
hurt
a
little

but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
pain
distracted
him
and
prevented
his
seeing
what
he
had
been
looking
at





What


s
this

Am
I
falling

My
legs
are
giving
way




thought
he

and
fell
on
his
back

He
opened
his
eyes

hoping
to
see
how
the
struggle
of
the
Frenchmen
with
the
gunners
ended

whether
the
red
haired
gunner
had
been
killed
or
not
and
whether
the
cannon
had
been
captured
or
saved

But
he
saw
nothing

Above
him
there
was
now
nothing
but
the
sky


the
lofty
sky

not
clear
yet
still
immeasurably
lofty

with
gray
clouds
gliding
slowly
across
it




How
quiet

peaceful

and
solemn

not
at
all
as
I
ran




thought
Prince
Andrew





not
as
we
ran

shouting
and
fighting

not
at
all
as
the
gunner
and
the
Frenchman
with
frightened
and
angry
faces
struggled
for
the
mop

how
differently
do
those
clouds
glide
across
that
lofty
infinite
sky

How
was
it
I
did
not
see
that
lofty
sky
before

And
how
happy
I
am
to
have
found
it
at
last

Yes

All
is
vanity

all
falsehood

except
that
infinite
sky

There
is
nothing

nothing

but
that

But
even
it
does
not
exist

there
is
nothing
but
quiet
and
peace

Thank
God












CHAPTER
XVII

On
our
right
flank
commanded
by
Bagrati

n

at
nine
o


clock
the
battle
had
not
yet
begun

Not
wishing
to
agree
to
Dolgor

kov


s
demand
to
commence
the
action

and
wishing
to
avert
responsibility
from
himself

Prince
Bagrati

n
proposed
to
Dolgor

kov
to
send
to
inquire
of
the
commander
in
chief

Bagrati

n
knew
that
as
the
distance
between
the
two
flanks
was
more
than
six
miles

even
if
the
messenger
were
not
killed

which
he
very
likely
would
be


and
found
the
commander
in
chief

which
would
be
very
difficult


he
would
not
be
able
to
get
back
before
evening


Bagrati

n
cast
his
large

expressionless

sleepy
eyes
round
his
suite

and
the
boyish
face
Rost

v

breathless
with
excitement
and
hope

was
the
first
to
catch
his
eye

He
sent
him





And
if
I
should
meet
His
Majesty
before
I
meet
the
commander
in
chief

your
excellency




said
Rost

v

with
his
hand
to
his
cap





You
can
give
the
message
to
His
Majesty




said
Dolgor

kov

hurriedly
interrupting
Bagrati

n


On
being
relieved
from
picket
duty
Rost

v
had
managed
to
get
a
few
hours



sleep
before
morning
and
felt
cheerful

bold

and
resolute

with
elasticity
of
movement

faith
in
his
good
fortune

and
generally
in
that
state
of
mind
which
makes
everything
seem
possible

pleasant

and
easy


All
his
wishes
were
being
fulfilled
that
morning

there
was
to
be
a
general
engagement
in
which
he
was
taking
part

more
than
that

he
was
orderly
to
the
bravest
general

and
still
more

he
was
going
with
a
message
to
Kut

zov

perhaps
even
to
the
sovereign
himself

The
morning
was
bright

he
had
a
good
horse
under
him

and
his
heart
was
full
of
joy
and
happiness

On
receiving
the
order
he
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
galloped
along
the
line

At
first
he
rode
along
the
line
of
Bagrati

n


s
troops

which
had
not
yet
advanced
into
action
but
were
standing
motionless

then
he
came
to
the
region
occupied
by
Uv

rov


s
cavalry
and
here
he
noticed
a
stir
and
signs
of
preparation
for
battle

having
passed
Uv

rov


s
cavalry
he
clearly
heard
the
sound
of
cannon
and
musketry
ahead
of
him

The
firing
grew
louder
and
louder


In
the
fresh
morning
air
were
now
heard

not
two
or
three
musket
shots
at
irregular
intervals
as
before

followed
by
one
or
two
cannon
shots

but
a
roll
of
volleys
of
musketry
from
the
slopes
of
the
hill
before
Pratzen

interrupted
by
such
frequent
reports
of
cannon
that
sometimes
several
of
them
were
not
separated
from
one
another
but
merged
into
a
general
roar


He
could
see
puffs
of
musketry
smoke
that
seemed
to
chase
one
another
down
the
hillsides

and
clouds
of
cannon
smoke
rolling

spreading

and
mingling
with
one
another

He
could
also

by
the
gleam
of
bayonets
visible
through
the
smoke

make
out
moving
masses
of
infantry
and
narrow
lines
of
artillery
with
green
caissons


Rost

v
stopped
his
horse
for
a
moment
on
a
hillock
to
see
what
was
going
on

but
strain
his
attention
as
he
would
he
could
not
understand
or
make
out
anything
of
what
was
happening

there
in
the
smoke
men
of
some
sort
were
moving
about

in
front
and
behind
moved
lines
of
troops

but
why

whither

and
who
they
were

it
was
impossible
to
make
out

These
sights
and
sounds
had
no
depressing
or
intimidating
effect
on
him

on
the
contrary

they
stimulated
his
energy
and
determination





Go
on

Go
on

Give
it
them




he
mentally
exclaimed
at
these
sounds

and
again
proceeded
to
gallop
along
the
line

penetrating
farther
and
farther
into
the
region
where
the
army
was
already
in
action





How
it
will
be
there
I
don


t
know

but
all
will
be
well




thought
Rost

v


After
passing
some
Austrian
troops
he
noticed
that
the
next
part
of
the
line

the
Guards

was
already
in
action





So
much
the
better

I
shall
see
it
close




he
thought


He
was
riding
almost
along
the
front
line

A
handful
of
men
came
galloping
toward
him

They
were
our
Uhlans
who
with
disordered
ranks
were
returning
from
the
attack

Rost

v
got
out
of
their
way

involuntarily
noticed
that
one
of
them
was
bleeding

and
galloped
on





That
is
no
business
of
mine




he
thought

He
had
not
ridden
many
hundred
yards
after
that
before
he
saw
to
his
left

across
the
whole
width
of
the
field

an
enormous
mass
of
cavalry
in
brilliant
white
uniforms

mounted
on
black
horses

trotting
straight
toward
him
and
across
his
path

Rost

v
put
his
horse
to
full
gallop
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
these
men

and
he
would
have
got
clear
had
they
continued
at
the
same
speed

but
they
kept
increasing
their
pace

so
that
some
of
the
horses
were
already
galloping

Rost

v
heard
the
thud
of
their
hoofs
and
the
jingle
of
their
weapons
and
saw
their
horses

their
figures

and
even
their
faces

more
and
more
distinctly

They
were
our
Horse
Guards

advancing
to
attack
the
French
cavalry
that
was
coming
to
meet
them


The
Horse
Guards
were
galloping

but
still
holding
in
their
horses

Rost

v
could
already
see
their
faces
and
heard
the
command




Charge




shouted
by
an
officer
who
was
urging
his
thoroughbred
to
full
speed

Rost

v

fearing
to
be
crushed
or
swept
into
the
attack
on
the
French

galloped
along
the
front
as
hard
as
his
horse
could
go

but
still
was
not
in
time
to
avoid
them


The
last
of
the
Horse
Guards

a
huge
pockmarked
fellow

frowned
angrily
on
seeing
Rost

v
before
him

with
whom
he
would
inevitably
collide

This
Guardsman
would
certainly
have
bowled
Rost

v
and
his
Bedouin
over

Rost

v
felt
himself
quite
tiny
and
weak
compared
to
these
gigantic
men
and
horses

had
it
not
occurred
to
Rost

v
to
flourish
his
whip
before
the
eyes
of
the
Guardsman


s
horse

The
heavy
black
horse

sixteen
hands
high

shied

throwing
back
its
ears

but
the
pockmarked
Guardsman
drove
his
huge
spurs
in
violently

and
the
horse

flourishing
its
tail
and
extending
its
neck

galloped
on
yet
faster

Hardly
had
the
Horse
Guards
passed
Rost

v
before
he
heard
them
shout




Hurrah




and
looking
back
saw
that
their
foremost
ranks
were
mixed
up
with
some
foreign
cavalry
with
red
epaulets

probably
French

He
could
see
nothing
more

for
immediately
afterwards
cannon
began
firing
from
somewhere
and
smoke
enveloped
everything


At
that
moment

as
the
Horse
Guards

having
passed
him

disappeared
in
the
smoke

Rost

v
hesitated
whether
to
gallop
after
them
or
to
go
where
he
was
sent

This
was
the
brilliant
charge
of
the
Horse
Guards
that
amazed
the
French
themselves

Rost

v
was
horrified
to
hear
later
that
of
all
that
mass
of
huge
and
handsome
men

of
all
those
brilliant

rich
youths

officers
and
cadets

who
had
galloped
past
him
on
their
thousand
ruble
horses

only
eighteen
were
left
after
the
charge





Why
should
I
envy
them

My
chance
is
not
lost

and
maybe
I
shall
see
the
Emperor
immediately




thought
Rost

v
and
galloped
on


When
he
came
level
with
the
Foot
Guards
he
noticed
that
about
them
and
around
them
cannon
balls
were
flying

of
which
he
was
aware
not
so
much
because
he
heard
their
sound
as
because
he
saw
uneasiness
on
the
soldiers



faces
and
unnatural
warlike
solemnity
on
those
of
the
officers


Passing
behind
one
of
the
lines
of
a
regiment
of
Foot
Guards
he
heard
a
voice
calling
him
by
name





Rost

v








What




he
answered

not
recognizing
Bor

s





I
say

we


ve
been
in
the
front
line

Our
regiment
attacked




said
Bor

s
with
the
happy
smile
seen
on
the
faces
of
young
men
who
have
been
under
fire
for
the
first
time


Rost

v
stopped





Have
you




he
said




Well

how
did
it
go








We
drove
them
back




said
Bor

s
with
animation

growing
talkative




Can
you
imagine
it




and
he
began
describing
how
the
Guards

having
taken
up
their
position
and
seeing
troops
before
them

thought
they
were
Austrians

and
all
at
once
discovered
from
the
cannon
balls
discharged
by
those
troops
that
they
were
themselves
in
the
front
line
and
had
unexpectedly
to
go
into
action

Rost

v
without
hearing
Bor

s
to
the
end
spurred
his
horse





Where
are
you
off
to




asked
Bor

s





With
a
message
to
His
Majesty








There
he
is




said
Bor

s

thinking
Rost

v
had
said



His
Highness




and
pointing
to
the
Grand
Duke
who
with
his
high
shoulders
and
frowning
brows
stood
a
hundred
paces
away
from
them
in
his
helmet
and
Horse
Guards



jacket

shouting
something
to
a
pale

white
uniformed
Austrian
officer





But
that


s
the
Grand
Duke

and
I
want
the
commander
in
chief
or
the
Emperor




said
Rost

v

and
was
about
to
spur
his
horse





Count

Count




shouted
Berg
who
ran
up
from
the
other
side
as
eager
as
Bor

s




Count

I
am
wounded
in
my
right
hand




and
he
showed
his
bleeding
hand
with
a
handkerchief
tied
round
it




and
I
remained
at
the
front

I
held
my
sword
in
my
left
hand

Count

All
our
family


the
von
Bergs


have
been
knights





He
said
something
more

but
Rost

v
did
not
wait
to
hear
it
and
rode
away


Having
passed
the
Guards
and
traversed
an
empty
space

Rost

v

to
avoid
again
getting
in
front
of
the
first
line
as
he
had
done
when
the
Horse
Guards
charged

followed
the
line
of
reserves

going
far
round
the
place
where
the
hottest
musket
fire
and
cannonade
were
heard

Suddenly
he
heard
musket
fire
quite
close
in
front
of
him
and
behind
our
troops

where
he
could
never
have
expected
the
enemy
to
be





What
can
it
be




he
thought




The
enemy
in
the
rear
of
our
army

Impossible




And
suddenly
he
was
seized
by
a
panic
of
fear
for
himself
and
for
the
issue
of
the
whole
battle




But
be
that
what
it
may




he
reflected




there
is
no
riding
round
it
now

I
must
look
for
the
commander
in
chief
here

and
if
all
is
lost
it
is
for
me
to
perish
with
the
rest





The
foreboding
of
evil
that
had
suddenly
come
over
Rost

v
was
more
and
more
confirmed
the
farther
he
rode
into
the
region
behind
the
village
of
Pratzen

which
was
full
of
troops
of
all
kinds





What
does
it
mean

What
is
it

Whom
are
they
firing
at

Who
is
firing




Rost

v
kept
asking
as
he
came
up
to
Russian
and
Austrian
soldiers
running
in
confused
crowds
across
his
path





The
devil
knows

They


ve
killed
everybody

It


s
all
up
now




he
was
told
in
Russian

German

and
Czech
by
the
crowd
of
fugitives
who
understood
what
was
happening
as
little
as
he
did





Kill
the
Germans




shouted
one





May
the
devil
take
them


the
traitors








Zum
Henker
diese
Russen






muttered
a
German











Hang
these
Russians






Several
wounded
men
passed
along
the
road

and
words
of
abuse

screams

and
groans
mingled
in
a
general
hubbub

then
the
firing
died
down

Rost

v
learned
later
that
Russian
and
Austrian
soldiers
had
been
firing
at
one
another





My
God

What
does
it
all
mean




thought
he




And
here

where
at
any
moment
the
Emperor
may
see
them




But
no

these
must
be
only
a
handful
of
scoundrels

It
will
soon
be
over

it
can


t
be
that

it
can


t
be

Only
to
get
past
them
quicker

quicker





The
idea
of
defeat
and
flight
could
not
enter
Rost

v


s
head

Though
he
saw
French
cannon
and
French
troops
on
the
Pratzen
Heights
just
where
he
had
been
ordered
to
look
for
the
commander
in
chief

he
could
not

did
not
wish
to

believe
that






CHAPTER
XVIII

Rost

v
had
been
ordered
to
look
for
Kut

zov
and
the
Emperor
near
the
village
of
Pratzen

But
neither
they
nor
a
single
commanding
officer
were
there

only
disorganized
crowds
of
troops
of
various
kinds

He
urged
on
his
already
weary
horse
to
get
quickly
past
these
crowds

but
the
farther
he
went
the
more
disorganized
they
were

The
highroad
on
which
he
had
come
out
was
thronged
with
cal

ches

carriages
of
all
sorts

and
Russian
and
Austrian
soldiers
of
all
arms

some
wounded
and
some
not

This
whole
mass
droned
and
jostled
in
confusion
under
the
dismal
influence
of
cannon
balls
flying
from
the
French
batteries
stationed
on
the
Pratzen
Heights





Where
is
the
Emperor

Where
is
Kut

zov




Rost

v
kept
asking
everyone
he
could
stop

but
got
no
answer
from
anyone


At
last
seizing
a
soldier
by
his
collar
he
forced
him
to
answer





Eh

brother

They


ve
all
bolted
long
ago




said
the
soldier

laughing
for
some
reason
and
shaking
himself
free


Having
left
that
soldier
who
was
evidently
drunk

Rost

v
stopped
the
horse
of
a
batman
or
groom
of
some
important
personage
and
began
to
question
him

The
man
announced
that
the
Tsar
had
been
driven
in
a
carriage
at
full
speed
about
an
hour
before
along
that
very
road
and
that
he
was
dangerously
wounded





It
can


t
be




said
Rost

v




It
must
have
been
someone
else








I
saw
him
myself




replied
the
man
with
a
self
confident
smile
of
derision




I
ought
to
know
the
Emperor
by
now

after
the
times
I


ve
seen
him
in
Petersburg

I
saw
him
just
as
I
see
you




There
he
sat
in
the
carriage
as
pale
as
anything

How
they
made
the
four
black
horses
fly

Gracious
me

they
did
rattle
past

It


s
time
I
knew
the
Imperial
horses
and
Ily


Iv

nych

I
don


t
think
Ily


drives
anyone
except
the
Tsar





Rost

v
let
go
of
the
horse
and
was
about
to
ride
on

when
a
wounded
officer
passing
by
addressed
him





Who
is
it
you
want




he
asked




The
commander
in
chief

He
was
killed
by
a
cannon
ball


struck
in
the
breast
before
our
regiment








Not
killed


wounded




another
officer
corrected
him





Who

Kut

zov




asked
Rost

v





Not
Kut

zov

but
what


s
his
name


well

never
mind



there
are
not
many
left
alive

Go
that
way

to
that
village

all
the
commanders
are
there




said
the
officer

pointing
to
the
village
of
Hosjeradek

and
he
walked
on


Rost

v
rode
on
at
a
footpace
not
knowing
why
or
to
whom
he
was
now
going

The
Emperor
was
wounded

the
battle
lost

It
was
impossible
to
doubt
it
now

Rost

v
rode
in
the
direction
pointed
out
to
him

in
which
he
saw
turrets
and
a
church

What
need
to
hurry

What
was
he
now
to
say
to
the
Tsar
or
to
Kut

zov

even
if
they
were
alive
and
unwounded





Take
this
road

your
honor

that
way
you
will
be
killed
at
once




a
soldier
shouted
to
him




They


d
kill
you
there








Oh

what
are
you
talking
about




said
another




Where
is
he
to
go

That
way
is
nearer





Rost

v
considered

and
then
went
in
the
direction
where
they
said
he
would
be
killed





It


s
all
the
same
now

If
the
Emperor
is
wounded

am
I
to
try
to
save
myself




he
thought

He
rode
on
to
the
region
where
the
greatest
number
of
men
had
perished
in
fleeing
from
Pratzen

The
French
had
not
yet
occupied
that
region

and
the
Russians


the
uninjured
and
slightly
wounded


had
left
it
long
ago

All
about
the
field

like
heaps
of
manure
on
well
kept
plowland

lay
from
ten
to
fifteen
dead
and
wounded
to
each
couple
of
acres

The
wounded
crept
together
in
twos
and
threes
and
one
could
hear
their
distressing
screams
and
groans

sometimes
feigned


or
so
it
seemed
to
Rost

v

He
put
his
horse
to
a
trot
to
avoid
seeing
all
these
suffering
men

and
he
felt
afraid


afraid
not
for
his
life

but
for
the
courage
he
needed
and
which
he
knew
would
not
stand
the
sight
of
these
unfortunates


The
French

who
had
ceased
firing
at
this
field
strewn
with
dead
and
wounded
where
there
was
no
one
left
to
fire
at

on
seeing
an
adjutant
riding
over
it
trained
a
gun
on
him
and
fired
several
shots

The
sensation
of
those
terrible
whistling
sounds
and
of
the
corpses
around
him
merged
in
Rost

v


s
mind
into
a
single
feeling
of
terror
and
pity
for
himself

He
remembered
his
mother


s
last
letter




What
would
she
feel




thought
he




if
she
saw
me
here
now
on
this
field
with
the
cannon
aimed
at
me





In
the
village
of
Hosjeradek
there
were
Russian
troops
retiring
from
the
field
of
battle

who
though
still
in
some
confusion
were
less
disordered

The
French
cannon
did
not
reach
there
and
the
musketry
fire
sounded
far
away

Here
everyone
clearly
saw
and
said
that
the
battle
was
lost

No
one
whom
Rost

v
asked
could
tell
him
where
the
Emperor
or
Kut

zov
was

Some
said
the
report
that
the
Emperor
was
wounded
was
correct

others
that
it
was
not

and
explained
the
false
rumor
that
had
spread
by
the
fact
that
the
Emperor


s
carriage
had
really
galloped
from
the
field
of
battle
with
the
pale
and
terrified
Ober
Hofmarschal
Count
Tolst

y

who
had
ridden
out
to
the
battlefield
with
others
in
the
Emperor


s
suite

One
officer
told
Rost

v
that
he
had
seen
someone
from
headquarters
behind
the
village
to
the
left

and
thither
Rost

v
rode

not
hoping
to
find
anyone
but
merely
to
ease
his
conscience

When
he
had
ridden
about
two
miles
and
had
passed
the
last
of
the
Russian
troops

he
saw

near
a
kitchen
garden
with
a
ditch
round
it

two
men
on
horseback
facing
the
ditch

One
with
a
white
plume
in
his
hat
seemed
familiar
to
Rost

v

the
other
on
a
beautiful
chestnut
horse

which
Rost

v
fancied
he
had
seen
before

rode
up
to
the
ditch

struck
his
horse
with
his
spurs

and
giving
it
the
rein
leaped
lightly
over

Only
a
little
earth
crumbled
from
the
bank
under
the
horse


s
hind
hoofs

Turning
the
horse
sharply

he
again
jumped
the
ditch

and
deferentially
addressed
the
horseman
with
the
white
plumes

evidently
suggesting
that
he
should
do
the
same

The
rider

whose
figure
seemed
familiar
to
Rost

v
and
involuntarily
riveted
his
attention

made
a
gesture
of
refusal
with
his
head
and
hand
and
by
that
gesture
Rost

v
instantly
recognized
his
lamented
and
adored
monarch





But
it
can


t
be
he

alone
in
the
midst
of
this
empty
field




thought
Rost

v

At
that
moment
Alexander
turned
his
head
and
Rost

v
saw
the
beloved
features
that
were
so
deeply
engraved
on
his
memory

The
Emperor
was
pale

his
cheeks
sunken
and
his
eyes
hollow

but
the
charm

the
mildness
of
his
features

was
all
the
greater

Rost

v
was
happy
in
the
assurance
that
the
rumors
about
the
Emperor
being
wounded
were
false

He
was
happy
to
be
seeing
him

He
knew
that
he
might
and
even
ought
to
go
straight
to
him
and
give
the
message
Dolgor

kov
had
ordered
him
to
deliver


But
as
a
youth
in
love
trembles

is
unnerved

and
dares
not
utter
the
thoughts
he
has
dreamed
of
for
nights

but
looks
around
for
help
or
a
chance
of
delay
and
flight
when
the
longed
for
moment
comes
and
he
is
alone
with
her

so
Rost

v

now
that
he
had
attained
what
he
had
longed
for
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world

did
not
know
how
to
approach
the
Emperor

and
a
thousand
reasons
occurred
to
him
why
it
would
be
inconvenient

unseemly

and
impossible
to
do
so





What

It
is
as
if
I
were
glad
of
a
chance
to
take
advantage
of
his
being
alone
and
despondent

A
strange
face
may
seem
unpleasant
or
painful
to
him
at
this
moment
of
sorrow

besides

what
can
I
say
to
him
now

when
my
heart
fails
me
and
my
mouth
feels
dry
at
the
mere
sight
of
him




Not
one
of
the
innumerable
speeches
addressed
to
the
Emperor
that
he
had
composed
in
his
imagination
could
he
now
recall

Those
speeches
were
intended
for
quite
other
conditions

they
were
for
the
most
part
to
be
spoken
at
a
moment
of
victory
and
triumph

generally
when
he
was
dying
of
wounds
and
the
sovereign
had
thanked
him
for
heroic
deeds

and
while
dying
he
expressed
the
love
his
actions
had
proved





Besides
how
can
I
ask
the
Emperor
for
his
instructions
for
the
right
flank
now
that
it
is
nearly
four
o


clock
and
the
battle
is
lost

No

certainly
I
must
not
approach
him

I
must
not
intrude
on
his
reflections

Better
die
a
thousand
times
than
risk
receiving
an
unkind
look
or
bad
opinion
from
him




Rost

v
decided

and
sorrowfully
and
with
a
heart
full
despair
he
rode
away

continually
looking
back
at
the
Tsar

who
still
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
indecision


While
Rost

v
was
thus
arguing
with
himself
and
riding
sadly
away

Captain
von
Toll
chanced
to
ride
to
the
same
spot

and
seeing
the
Emperor
at
once
rode
up
to
him

offered
his
services

and
assisted
him
to
cross
the
ditch
on
foot

The
Emperor

wishing
to
rest
and
feeling
unwell

sat
down
under
an
apple
tree
and
von
Toll
remained
beside
him

Rost

v
from
a
distance
saw
with
envy
and
remorse
how
von
Toll
spoke
long
and
warmly
to
the
Emperor
and
how
the
Emperor

evidently
weeping

covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
pressed
von
Toll


s
hand





And
I
might
have
been
in
his
place




thought
Rost

v

and
hardly
restraining
his
tears
of
pity
for
the
Emperor

he
rode
on
in
utter
despair

not
knowing
where
to
or
why
he
was
now
riding


His
despair
was
all
the
greater
from
feeling
that
his
own
weakness
was
the
cause
of
his
grief


He
might



not
only
might
but
should

have
gone
up
to
the
sovereign

It
was
a
unique
chance
to
show
his
devotion
to
the
Emperor
and
he
had
not
made
use
of
it







What
have
I
done




thought
he

And
he
turned
round
and
galloped
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
Emperor

but
there
was
no
one
beyond
the
ditch
now

Only
some
carts
and
carriages
were
passing
by

From
one
of
the
drivers
he
learned
that
Kut

zov


s
staff
were
not
far
off

in
the
village
the
vehicles
were
going
to

Rost

v
followed
them

In
front
of
him
walked
Kut

zov


s
groom
leading
horses
in
horsecloths

Then
came
a
cart

and
behind
that
walked
an
old

bandy
legged
domestic
serf
in
a
peaked
cap
and
sheepskin
coat





Tit

I
say

Tit




said
the
groom





What




answered
the
old
man
absent
mindedly





Go

Tit

Thresh
a
bit








Oh

you
fool




said
the
old
man

spitting
angrily

Some
time
passed
in
silence

and
then
the
same
joke
was
repeated



Before
five
in
the
evening
the
battle
had
been
lost
at
all
points

More
than
a
hundred
cannon
were
already
in
the
hands
of
the
French


Przebysz

wski
and
his
corps
had
laid
down
their
arms

Other
columns
after
losing
half
their
men
were
retreating
in
disorderly
confused
masses


The
remains
of
Langeron


s
and
Dokht

rov


s
mingled
forces
were
crowding
around
the
dams
and
banks
of
the
ponds
near
the
village
of
Augesd


After
five
o


clock
it
was
only
at
the
Augesd
Dam
that
a
hot
cannonade

delivered
by
the
French
alone

was
still
to
be
heard
from
numerous
batteries
ranged
on
the
slopes
of
the
Pratzen
Heights

directed
at
our
retreating
forces


In
the
rearguard

Dokht

rov
and
others
rallying
some
battalions
kept
up
a
musketry
fire
at
the
French
cavalry
that
was
pursuing
our
troops

It
was
growing
dusk

On
the
narrow
Augesd
Dam
where
for
so
many
years
the
old
miller
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
in
his
tasseled
cap
peacefully
angling

while
his
grandson

with
shirt
sleeves
rolled
up

handled
the
floundering
silvery
fish
in
the
watering
can

on
that
dam
over
which
for
so
many
years
Moravians
in
shaggy
caps
and
blue
jackets
had
peacefully
driven
their
two
horse
carts
loaded
with
wheat
and
had
returned
dusty
with
flour
whitening
their
carts


on
that
narrow
dam
amid
the
wagons
and
the
cannon

under
the
horses



hoofs
and
between
the
wagon
wheels

men
disfigured
by
fear
of
death
now
crowded
together

crushing
one
another

dying

stepping
over
the
dying
and
killing
one
another

only
to
move
on
a
few
steps
and
be
killed
themselves
in
the
same
way


Every
ten
seconds
a
cannon
ball
flew
compressing
the
air
around

or
a
shell
burst
in
the
midst
of
that
dense
throng

killing
some
and
splashing
with
blood
those
near
them


D

lokhov


now
an
officer


wounded
in
the
arm

and
on
foot

with
the
regimental
commander
on
horseback
and
some
ten
men
of
his
company

represented
all
that
was
left
of
that
whole
regiment

Impelled
by
the
crowd

they
had
got
wedged
in
at
the
approach
to
the
dam
and

jammed
in
on
all
sides

had
stopped
because
a
horse
in
front
had
fallen
under
a
cannon
and
the
crowd
were
dragging
it
out

A
cannon
ball
killed
someone
behind
them

another
fell
in
front
and
splashed
D

lokhov
with
blood

The
crowd

pushing
forward
desperately

squeezed
together

moved
a
few
steps

and
again
stopped





Move
on
a
hundred
yards
and
we
are
certainly
saved

remain
here
another
two
minutes
and
it
is
certain
death




thought
each
one


D

lokhov
who
was
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
forced
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
dam

throwing
two
soldiers
off
their
feet

and
ran
onto
the
slippery
ice
that
covered
the
millpool





Turn
this
way




he
shouted

jumping
over
the
ice
which
creaked
under
him




turn
this
way




he
shouted
to
those
with
the
gun




It
bears








The
ice
bore
him
but
it
swayed
and
creaked

and
it
was
plain
that
it
would
give
way
not
only
under
a
cannon
or
a
crowd

but
very
soon
even
under
his
weight
alone

The
men
looked
at
him
and
pressed
to
the
bank

hesitating
to
step
onto
the
ice

The
general
on
horseback
at
the
entrance
to
the
dam
raised
his
hand
and
opened
his
mouth
to
address
D

lokhov

Suddenly
a
cannon
ball
hissed
so
low
above
the
crowd
that
everyone
ducked

It
flopped
into
something
moist

and
the
general
fell
from
his
horse
in
a
pool
of
blood

Nobody
gave
him
a
look
or
thought
of
raising
him





Get
onto
the
ice

over
the
ice

Go
on

Turn

Don


t
you
hear

Go
on




innumerable
voices
suddenly
shouted
after
the
ball
had
struck
the
general

the
men
themselves
not
knowing
what

or
why

they
were
shouting


One
of
the
hindmost
guns
that
was
going
onto
the
dam
turned
off
onto
the
ice

Crowds
of
soldiers
from
the
dam
began
running
onto
the
frozen
pond

The
ice
gave
way
under
one
of
the
foremost
soldiers

and
one
leg
slipped
into
the
water

He
tried
to
right
himself
but
fell
in
up
to
his
waist

The
nearest
soldiers
shrank
back

the
gun
driver
stopped
his
horse

but
from
behind
still
came
the
shouts




Onto
the
ice

why
do
you
stop

Go
on

Go
on




And
cries
of
horror
were
heard
in
the
crowd

The
soldiers
near
the
gun
waved
their
arms
and
beat
the
horses
to
make
them
turn
and
move
on

The
horses
moved
off
the
bank

The
ice

that
had
held
under
those
on
foot

collapsed
in
a
great
mass

and
some
forty
men
who
were
on
it
dashed

some
forward
and
some
back

drowning
one
another


Still
the
cannon
balls
continued
regularly
to
whistle
and
flop
onto
the
ice
and
into
the
water
and
oftenest
of
all
among
the
crowd
that
covered
the
dam

the
pond

and
the
bank






CHAPTER
XIX

On
the
Pratzen
Heights

where
he
had
fallen
with
the
flagstaff
in
his
hand

lay
Prince
Andrew
Bolk

nski
bleeding
profusely
and
unconsciously
uttering
a
gentle

piteous

and
childlike
moan


Toward
evening
he
ceased
moaning
and
became
quite
still

He
did
not
know
how
long
his
unconsciousness
lasted

Suddenly
he
again
felt
that
he
was
alive
and
suffering
from
a
burning

lacerating
pain
in
his
head





Where
is
it

that
lofty
sky
that
I
did
not
know
till
now

but
saw
today




was
his
first
thought




And
I
did
not
know
this
suffering
either




he
thought




Yes

I
did
not
know
anything

anything
at
all
till
now

But
where
am
I





He
listened
and
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
horses

and
voices
speaking
French

He
opened
his
eyes

Above
him
again
was
the
same
lofty
sky
with
clouds
that
had
risen
and
were
floating
still
higher

and
between
them
gleamed
blue
infinity

He
did
not
turn
his
head
and
did
not
see
those
who

judging
by
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
voices

had
ridden
up
and
stopped
near
him


It
was
Napoleon
accompanied
by
two
aides
de
camp

Bonaparte
riding
over
the
battlefield
had
given
final
orders
to
strengthen
the
batteries
firing
at
the
Augesd
Dam
and
was
looking
at
the
killed
and
wounded
left
on
the
field





Fine
men




remarked
Napoleon

looking
at
a
dead
Russian
grenadier

who

with
his
face
buried
in
the
ground
and
a
blackened
nape

lay
on
his
stomach
with
an
already
stiffened
arm
flung
wide





The
ammunition
for
the
guns
in
position
is
exhausted

Your
Majesty




said
an
adjutant
who
had
come
from
the
batteries
that
were
firing
at
Augesd





Have
some
brought
from
the
reserve




said
Napoleon

and
having
gone
on
a
few
steps
he
stopped
before
Prince
Andrew

who
lay
on
his
back
with
the
flagstaff
that
had
been
dropped
beside
him


The
flag
had
already
been
taken
by
the
French
as
a
trophy






That


s
a
fine
death




said
Napoleon
as
he
gazed
at
Bolk

nski


Prince
Andrew
understood
that
this
was
said
of
him
and
that
it
was
Napoleon
who
said
it

He
heard
the
speaker
addressed
as
Sire

But
he
heard
the
words
as
he
might
have
heard
the
buzzing
of
a
fly

Not
only
did
they
not
interest
him

but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
and
at
once
forgot
them

His
head
was
burning

he
felt
himself
bleeding
to
death

and
he
saw
above
him
the
remote

lofty

and
everlasting
sky

He
knew
it
was
Napoleon


his
hero


but
at
that
moment
Napoleon
seemed
to
him
such
a
small

insignificant
creature
compared
with
what
was
passing
now
between
himself
and
that
lofty
infinite
sky
with
the
clouds
flying
over
it

At
that
moment
it
meant
nothing
to
him
who
might
be
standing
over
him

or
what
was
said
of
him

he
was
only
glad
that
people
were
standing
near
him
and
only
wished
that
they
would
help
him
and
bring
him
back
to
life

which
seemed
to
him
so
beautiful
now
that
he
had
today
learned
to
understand
it
so
differently

He
collected
all
his
strength

to
stir
and
utter
a
sound

He
feebly
moved
his
leg
and
uttered
a
weak

sickly
groan
which
aroused
his
own
pity





Ah

He
is
alive




said
Napoleon




Lift
this
young
man
up
and
carry
him
to
the
dressing
station





Having
said
this

Napoleon
rode
on
to
meet
Marshal
Lannes

who

hat
in
hand

rode
up
smiling
to
the
Emperor
to
congratulate
him
on
the
victory


Prince
Andrew
remembered
nothing
more

he
lost
consciousness
from
the
terrible
pain
of
being
lifted
onto
the
stretcher

the
jolting
while
being
moved

and
the
probing
of
his
wound
at
the
dressing
station

He
did
not
regain
consciousness
till
late
in
the
day

when
with
other
wounded
and
captured
Russian
officers
he
was
carried
to
the
hospital

During
this
transfer
he
felt
a
little
stronger
and
was
able
to
look
about
him
and
even
speak


The
first
words
he
heard
on
coming
to
his
senses
were
those
of
a
French
convoy
officer

who
said
rapidly




We
must
halt
here

the
Emperor
will
pass
here
immediately

it
will
please
him
to
see
these
gentlemen
prisoners








There
are
so
many
prisoners
today

nearly
the
whole
Russian
army

that
he
is
probably
tired
of
them




said
another
officer





All
the
same

They
say
this
one
is
the
commander
of
all
the
Emperor
Alexander


s
Guards




said
the
first
one

indicating
a
Russian
officer
in
the
white
uniform
of
the
Horse
Guards


Bolk

nski
recognized
Prince
Repn

n
whom
he
had
met
in
Petersburg
society

Beside
him
stood
a
lad
of
nineteen

also
a
wounded
officer
of
the
Horse
Guards


Bonaparte

having
come
up
at
a
gallop

stopped
his
horse





Which
is
the
senior




he
asked

on
seeing
the
prisoners


They
named
the
colonel

Prince
Repn

n





You
are
the
commander
of
the
Emperor
Alexander


s
regiment
of
Horse
Guards




asked
Napoleon





I
commanded
a
squadron




replied
Repn

n





Your
regiment
fulfilled
its
duty
honorably




said
Napoleon





The
praise
of
a
great
commander
is
a
soldier


s
highest
reward




said
Repn

n





I
bestow
it
with
pleasure




said
Napoleon




And
who
is
that
young
man
beside
you





Prince
Repn

n
named
Lieutenant
Sukht

len


After
looking
at
him
Napoleon
smiled





He


s
very
young
to
come
to
meddle
with
us








Youth
is
no
hindrance
to
courage




muttered
Sukht

len
in
a
failing
voice





A
splendid
reply




said
Napoleon




Young
man

you
will
go
far





Prince
Andrew

who
had
also
been
brought
forward
before
the
Emperor


s
eyes
to
complete
the
show
of
prisoners

could
not
fail
to
attract
his
attention

Napoleon
apparently
remembered
seeing
him
on
the
battlefield
and

addressing
him

again
used
the
epithet



young
man



that
was
connected
in
his
memory
with
Prince
Andrew





Well

and
you

young
man




said
he




How
do
you
feel

mon
brave





Though
five
minutes
before

Prince
Andrew
had
been
able
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
soldiers
who
were
carrying
him

now
with
his
eyes
fixed
straight
on
Napoleon

he
was
silent




So
insignificant
at
that
moment
seemed
to
him
all
the
interests
that
engrossed
Napoleon

so
mean
did
his
hero
himself
with
his
paltry
vanity
and
joy
in
victory
appear

compared
to
the
lofty

equitable

and
kindly
sky
which
he
had
seen
and
understood

that
he
could
not
answer
him


Everything
seemed
so
futile
and
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
stern
and
solemn
train
of
thought
that
weakness
from
loss
of
blood

suffering

and
the
nearness
of
death
aroused
in
him

Looking
into
Napoleon


s
eyes
Prince
Andrew
thought
of
the
insignificance
of
greatness

the
unimportance
of
life
which
no
one
could
understand

and
the
still
greater
unimportance
of
death

the
meaning
of
which
no
one
alive
could
understand
or
explain


The
Emperor
without
waiting
for
an
answer
turned
away
and
said
to
one
of
the
officers
as
he
went




Have
these
gentlemen
attended
to
and
taken
to
my
bivouac

let
my
doctor

Larrey

examine
their
wounds

Au
revoir

Prince
Repn

n




and
he
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
away


His
face
shone
with
self
satisfaction
and
pleasure


The
soldiers
who
had
carried
Prince
Andrew
had
noticed
and
taken
the
little
gold
icon
Princess
Mary
had
hung
round
her
brother


s
neck

but
seeing
the
favor
the
Emperor
showed
the
prisoners

they
now
hastened
to
return
the
holy
image


Prince
Andrew
did
not
see
how
and
by
whom
it
was
replaced

but
the
little
icon
with
its
thin
gold
chain
suddenly
appeared
upon
his
chest
outside
his
uniform





It
would
be
good




thought
Prince
Andrew

glancing
at
the
icon
his
sister
had
hung
round
his
neck
with
such
emotion
and
reverence




it
would
be
good
if
everything
were
as
clear
and
simple
as
it
seems
to
Mary

How
good
it
would
be
to
know
where
to
seek
for
help
in
this
life

and
what
to
expect
after
it
beyond
the
grave

How
happy
and
calm
I
should
be
if
I
could
now
say




Lord

have
mercy
on
me







But
to
whom
should
I
say
that

Either
to
a
Power
indefinable

incomprehensible

which
I
not
only
cannot
address
but
which
I
cannot
even
express
in
words


the
Great
All
or
Nothing




said
he
to
himself




or
to
that
God
who
has
been
sewn
into
this
amulet
by
Mary

There
is
nothing
certain

nothing
at
all
except
the
unimportance
of
everything
I
understand

and
the
greatness
of
something
incomprehensible
but
all
important





The
stretchers
moved
on

At
every
jolt
he
again
felt
unendurable
pain

his
feverishness
increased
and
he
grew
delirious

Visions
of
his
father

wife

sister

and
future
son

and
the
tenderness
he
had
felt
the
night
before
the
battle

the
figure
of
the
insignificant
little
Napoleon

and
above
all
this
the
lofty
sky

formed
the
chief
subjects
of
his
delirious
fancies


The
quiet
home
life
and
peaceful
happiness
of
Bald
Hills
presented
itself
to
him

He
was
already
enjoying
that
happiness
when
that
little
Napoleon
had
suddenly
appeared
with
his
unsympathizing
look
of
shortsighted
delight
at
the
misery
of
others

and
doubts
and
torments
had
followed

and
only
the
heavens
promised
peace

Toward
morning
all
these
dreams
melted
and
merged
into
the
chaos
and
darkness
of
unconciousness
and
oblivion
which
in
the
opinion
of
Napoleon


s
doctor

Larrey

was
much
more
likely
to
end
in
death
than
in
convalescence





He
is
a
nervous

bilious
subject




said
Larrey




and
will
not
recover





And
Prince
Andrew

with
others
fatally
wounded

was
left
to
the
care
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
district






BOOK
FOUR











CHAPTER
I

Early
in
the
year





Nicholas
Rost

v
returned
home
on
leave

Den

sov
was
going
home
to
Vor

nezh
and
Rost

v
persuaded
him
to
travel
with
him
as
far
as
Moscow
and
to
stay
with
him
there

Meeting
a
comrade
at
the
last
post
station
but
one
before
Moscow

Den

sov
had
drunk
three
bottles
of
wine
with
him
and

despite
the
jolting
ruts
across
the
snow
covered
road

did
not
once
wake
up
on
the
way
to
Moscow

but
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
sleigh
beside
Rost

v

who
grew
more
and
more
impatient
the
nearer
they
got
to
Moscow





How
much
longer

How
much
longer

Oh

these
insufferable
streets

shops

bakers



signboards

street
lamps

and
sleighs




thought
Rost

v

when
their
leave
permits
had
been
passed
at
the
town
gate
and
they
had
entered
Moscow





Den

sov

We


re
here

He


s
asleep




he
added

leaning
forward
with
his
whole
body
as
if
in
that
position
he
hoped
to
hasten
the
speed
of
the
sleigh


Den

sov
gave
no
answer





There


s
the
corner
at
the
crossroads

where
the
cabman

Zakh

r

has
his
stand

and
there


s
Zakh

r
himself
and
still
the
same
horse

And
here


s
the
little
shop
where
we
used
to
buy
gingerbread

Can


t
you
hurry
up

Now
then








Which
house
is
it




asked
the
driver





Why

that
one

right
at
the
end

the
big
one

Don


t
you
see

That


s
our
house




said
Rost

v




Of
course

it


s
our
house

Den

sov

Den

sov

We


re
almost
there





Den

sov
raised
his
head

coughed

and
made
no
answer





Dm

tri




said
Rost

v
to
his
valet
on
the
box




those
lights
are
in
our
house

aren


t
they








Yes

sir

and
there


s
a
light
in
your
father


s
study








Then
they


ve
not
gone
to
bed
yet

What
do
you
think

Mind
now

don


t
forget
to
put
out
my
new
coat




added
Rost

v

fingering
his
new
mustache




Now
then

get
on




he
shouted
to
the
driver




Do
wake
up

V

ska




he
went
on

turning
to
Den

sov

whose
head
was
again
nodding




Come

get
on

You
shall
have
three
rubles
for
vodka


get
on




Rost

v
shouted

when
the
sleigh
was
only
three
houses
from
his
door

It
seemed
to
him
the
horses
were
not
moving
at
all

At
last
the
sleigh
bore
to
the
right

drew
up
at
an
entrance

and
Rost

v
saw
overhead
the
old
familiar
cornice
with
a
bit
of
plaster
broken
off

the
porch

and
the
post
by
the
side
of
the
pavement

He
sprang
out
before
the
sleigh
stopped

and
ran
into
the
hall

The
house
stood
cold
and
silent

as
if
quite
regardless
of
who
had
come
to
it

There
was
no
one
in
the
hall




Oh
God

Is
everyone
all
right




he
thought

stopping
for
a
moment
with
a
sinking
heart

and
then
immediately
starting
to
run
along
the
hall
and
up
the
warped
steps
of
the
familiar
staircase

The
well
known
old
door
handle

which
always
angered
the
countess
when
it
was
not
properly
cleaned

turned
as
loosely
as
ever

A
solitary
tallow
candle
burned
in
the
anteroom


Old
Michael
was
asleep
on
the
chest

Prok

fy

the
footman

who
was
so
strong
that
he
could
lift
the
back
of
the
carriage
from
behind

sat
plaiting
slippers
out
of
cloth
selvedges

He
looked
up
at
the
opening
door
and
his
expression
of
sleepy
indifference
suddenly
changed
to
one
of
delighted
amazement





Gracious
heavens

The
young
count




he
cried

recognizing
his
young
master




Can
it
be

My
treasure




and
Prok

fy

trembling
with
excitement

rushed
toward
the
drawing
room
door

probably
in
order
to
announce
him

but

changing
his
mind

came
back
and
stooped
to
kiss
the
young
man


s
shoulder





All
well




asked
Rost

v

drawing
away
his
arm





Yes

God
be
thanked

Yes

They


ve
just
finished
supper

Let
me
have
a
look
at
you

your
excellency








Is
everything
quite
all
right








The
Lord
be
thanked

yes





Rost

v

who
had
completely
forgotten
Den

sov

not
wishing
anyone
to
forestall
him

threw
off
his
fur
coat
and
ran
on
tiptoe
through
the
large
dark
ballroom

All
was
the
same

there
were
the
same
old
card
tables
and
the
same
chandelier
with
a
cover
over
it

but
someone
had
already
seen
the
young
master

and

before
he
had
reached
the
drawing
room

something
flew
out
from
a
side
door
like
a
tornado
and
began
hugging
and
kissing
him

Another
and
yet
another
creature
of
the
same
kind
sprang
from
a
second
door
and
a
third

more
hugging

more
kissing

more
outcries

and
tears
of
joy

He
could
not
distinguish
which
was
Papa

which
Nat

sha

and
which
P

tya

Everyone
shouted

talked

and
kissed
him
at
the
same
time

Only
his
mother
was
not
there

he
noticed
that





And
I
did
not
know



Nicholas



My
darling











Here
he
is



our
own



K

lya



dear
fellow



How
he
has
changed




Where
are
the
candles




Tea














Nicholas





And
me

kiss
me








Dearest



and
me





S

nya

Nat

sha

P

tya

Anna
Mikh

ylovna

V

ra

and
the
old
count
were
all
hugging
him

and
the
serfs

men
and
maids

flocked
into
the
room

exclaiming
and
oh
ing
and
ah
ing


P

tya

clinging
to
his
legs

kept
shouting




And
me
too





Nat

sha

after
she
had
pulled
him
down
toward
her
and
covered
his
face
with
kisses

holding
him
tight
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat

sprang
away
and
pranced
up
and
down
in
one
place
like
a
goat
and
shrieked
piercingly


All
around
were
loving
eyes
glistening
with
tears
of
joy

and
all
around
were
lips
seeking
a
kiss


S

nya
too

all
rosy
red

clung
to
his
arm
and

radiant
with
bliss

looked
eagerly
toward
his
eyes

waiting
for
the
look
for
which
she
longed

S

nya
now
was
sixteen
and
she
was
very
pretty

especially
at
this
moment
of
happy

rapturous
excitement

She
gazed
at
him

not
taking
her
eyes
off
him

and
smiling
and
holding
her
breath

He
gave
her
a
grateful
look

but
was
still
expectant
and
looking
for
someone

The
old
countess
had
not
yet
come

But
now
steps
were
heard
at
the
door

steps
so
rapid
that
they
could
hardly
be
his
mother


s


Yet
it
was
she

dressed
in
a
new
gown
which
he
did
not
know

made
since
he
had
left

All
the
others
let
him
go

and
he
ran
to
her

When
they
met

she
fell
on
his
breast

sobbing

She
could
not
lift
her
face

but
only
pressed
it
to
the
cold
braiding
of
his
hussar


s
jacket

Den

sov

who
had
come
into
the
room
unnoticed
by
anyone

stood
there
and
wiped
his
eyes
at
the
sight





Vas

li
Den

sov

your
son


s
friend




he
said

introducing
himself
to
the
count

who
was
looking
inquiringly
at
him





You
are
most
welcome

I
know

I
know




said
the
count

kissing
and
embracing
Den

sov




Nicholas
wrote
us



Nat

sha

V

ra

look

Here
is
Den

sov





The
same
happy

rapturous
faces
turned
to
the
shaggy
figure
of
Den

sov





Darling
Den

sov




screamed
Nat

sha

beside
herself
with
rapture

springing
to
him

putting
her
arms
round
him

and
kissing
him

This
escapade
made
everybody
feel
confused

Den

sov
blushed
too

but
smiled
and

taking
Nat

sha


s
hand

kissed
it


Den

sov
was
shown
to
the
room
prepared
for
him

and
the
Rost

vs
all
gathered
round
Nicholas
in
the
sitting
room


The
old
countess

not
letting
go
of
his
hand
and
kissing
it
every
moment

sat
beside
him

the
rest

crowding
round
him

watched
every
movement

word

or
look
of
his

never
taking
their
blissfully
adoring
eyes
off
him

His
brother
and
sisters
struggled
for
the
places
nearest
to
him
and
disputed
with
one
another
who
should
bring
him
his
tea

handkerchief

and
pipe


Rost

v
was
very
happy
in
the
love
they
showed
him

but
the
first
moment
of
meeting
had
been
so
beatific
that
his
present
joy
seemed
insufficient

and
he
kept
expecting
something
more

more
and
yet
more


Next
morning

after
the
fatigues
of
their
journey

the
travelers
slept
till
ten
o


clock


In
the
room
next
their
bedroom
there
was
a
confusion
of
sabers

satchels

sabretaches

open
portmanteaus

and
dirty
boots

Two
freshly
cleaned
pairs
with
spurs
had
just
been
placed
by
the
wall

The
servants
were
bringing
in
jugs
and
basins

hot
water
for
shaving

and
their
well
brushed
clothes

There
was
a
masculine
odor
and
a
smell
of
tobacco





Hallo

Gw

ska


my
pipe




came
Vas

li
Den

sov


s
husky
voice




Wost

v

get
up





Rost

v

rubbing
his
eyes
that
seemed
glued
together

raised
his
disheveled
head
from
the
hot
pillow





Why

is
it
late








Late

It


s
nearly
ten
o


clock




answered
Nat

sha


s
voice

A
rustle
of
starched
petticoats
and
the
whispering
and
laughter
of
girls



voices
came
from
the
adjoining
room

The
door
was
opened
a
crack
and
there
was
a
glimpse
of
something
blue

of
ribbons

black
hair

and
merry
faces

It
was
Nat

sha

S

nya

and
P

tya

who
had
come
to
see
whether
they
were
getting
up





Nicholas

Get
up




Nat

sha


s
voice
was
again
heard
at
the
door





Directly





Meanwhile

P

tya

having
found
and
seized
the
sabers
in
the
outer
room

with
the
delight
boys
feel
at
the
sight
of
a
military
elder
brother

and
forgetting
that
it
was
unbecoming
for
the
girls
to
see
men
undressed

opened
the
bedroom
door





Is
this
your
saber




he
shouted


The
girls
sprang
aside

Den

sov
hid
his
hairy
legs
under
the
blanket

looking
with
a
scared
face
at
his
comrade
for
help

The
door

having
let
P

tya
in

closed
again

A
sound
of
laughter
came
from
behind
it





Nicholas

Come
out
in
your
dressing
gown




said
Nat

sha


s
voice





Is
this
your
saber




asked
P

tya




Or
is
it
yours




he
said

addressing
the
black
mustached
Den

sov
with
servile
deference


Rost

v
hurriedly
put
something
on
his
feet

drew
on
his
dressing
gown

and
went
out

Nat

sha
had
put
on
one
spurred
boot
and
was
just
getting
her
foot
into
the
other

S

nya

when
he
came
in

was
twirling
round
and
was
about
to
expand
her
dresses
into
a
balloon
and
sit
down

They
were
dressed
alike

in
new
pale
blue
frocks

and
were
both
fresh

rosy

and
bright

S

nya
ran
away

but
Nat

sha

taking
her
brother


s
arm

led
him
into
the
sitting
room

where
they
began
talking

They
hardly
gave
one
another
time
to
ask
questions
and
give
replies
concerning
a
thousand
little
matters
which
could
not
interest
anyone
but
themselves

Nat

sha
laughed
at
every
word
he
said
or
that
she
said
herself

not
because
what
they
were
saying
was
amusing

but
because
she
felt
happy
and
was
unable
to
control
her
joy
which
expressed
itself
by
laughter





Oh

how
nice

how
splendid




she
said
to
everything


Rost

v
felt
that

under
the
influence
of
the
warm
rays
of
love

that
childlike
smile
which
had
not
once
appeared
on
his
face
since
he
left
home
now
for
the
first
time
after
eighteen
months
again
brightened
his
soul
and
his
face





No

but
listen




she
said




now
you
are
quite
a
man

aren


t
you

I


m
awfully
glad
you


re
my
brother




She
touched
his
mustache




I
want
to
know
what
you
men
are
like

Are
you
the
same
as
we

No








Why
did
S

nya
run
away




asked
Rost

v





Ah

yes

That


s
a
whole
long
story

How
are
you
going
to
speak
to
her


thou
or
you








As
may
happen




said
Rost

v





No

call
her
you

please

I


ll
tell
you
all
about
it
some
other
time

No

I


ll
tell
you
now

You
know
S

nya


s
my
dearest
friend

Such
a
friend
that
I
burned
my
arm
for
her
sake

Look
here





She
pulled
up
her
muslin
sleeve
and
showed
him
a
red
scar
on
her
long

slender

delicate
arm

high
above
the
elbow
on
that
part
that
is
covered
even
by
a
ball
dress





I
burned
this
to
prove
my
love
for
her

I
just
heated
a
ruler
in
the
fire
and
pressed
it
there





Sitting
on
the
sofa
with
the
little
cushions
on
its
arms

in
what
used
to
be
his
old
schoolroom

and
looking
into
Nat

sha


s
wildly
bright
eyes

Rost

v
re
entered
that
world
of
home
and
childhood
which
had
no
meaning
for
anyone
else

but
gave
him
some
of
the
best
joys
of
his
life

and
the
burning
of
an
arm
with
a
ruler
as
a
proof
of
love
did
not
seem
to
him
senseless

he
understood
and
was
not
surprised
at
it





Well

and
is
that
all




he
asked





We
are
such
friends

such
friends

All
that
ruler
business
was
just
nonsense

but
we
are
friends
forever

She

if
she
loves
anyone

does
it
for
life

but
I
don


t
understand
that

I
forget
quickly








Well

what
then








Well

she
loves
me
and
you
like
that





Nat

sha
suddenly
flushed





Why

you
remember
before
you
went
away




Well

she
says
you
are
to
forget
all
that




She
says




I
shall
love
him
always

but
let
him
be
free




Isn


t
that
lovely
and
noble

Yes

very
noble

Isn


t
it




asked
Nat

sha

so
seriously
and
excitedly
that
it
was
evident
that
what
she
was
now
saying
she
had
talked
of
before

with
tears


Rost

v
became
thoughtful





I
never
go
back
on
my
word




he
said




Besides

S

nya
is
so
charming
that
only
a
fool
would
renounce
such
happiness








No

no




cried
Nat

sha




she
and
I
have
already
talked
it
over

We
knew
you


d
say
so

But
it
won


t
do

because
you
see

if
you
say
that


if
you
consider
yourself
bound
by
your
promise


it
will
seem
as
if
she
had
not
meant
it
seriously

It
makes
it
as
if
you
were
marrying
her
because
you
must

and
that
wouldn


t
do
at
all





Rost

v
saw
that
it
had
been
well
considered
by
them

S

nya
had
already
struck
him
by
her
beauty
on
the
preceding
day

Today

when
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her

she
seemed
still
more
lovely

She
was
a
charming
girl
of
sixteen

evidently
passionately
in
love
with
him

he
did
not
doubt
that
for
an
instant


Why
should
he
not
love
her
now

and
even
marry
her

Rost

v
thought

but
just
now
there
were
so
many
other
pleasures
and
interests
before
him




Yes

they
have
taken
a
wise
decision




he
thought




I
must
remain
free








Well
then

that


s
excellent




said
he




We


ll
talk
it
over
later
on

Oh

how
glad
I
am
to
have
you








Well

and
are
you
still
true
to
Bor

s




he
continued





Oh

what
nonsense




cried
Nat

sha

laughing




I
don


t
think
about
him
or
anyone
else

and
I
don


t
want
anything
of
the
kind








Dear
me

Then
what
are
you
up
to
now








Now




repeated
Nat

sha

and
a
happy
smile
lit
up
her
face




Have
you
seen
Duport








No








Not
seen
Duport


the
famous
dancer

Well
then

you
won


t
understand

That


s
what
I


m
up
to





Curving
her
arms

Nat

sha
held
out
her
skirts
as
dancers
do

ran
back
a
few
steps

turned

cut
a
caper

brought
her
little
feet
sharply
together

and
made
some
steps
on
the
very
tips
of
her
toes





See

I


m
standing

See




she
said

but
could
not
maintain
herself
on
her
toes
any
longer




So
that


s
what
I


m
up
to

I


ll
never
marry
anyone

but
will
be
a
dancer

Only
don


t
tell
anyone





Rost

v
laughed
so
loud
and
merrily
that
Den

sov

in
his
bedroom

felt
envious
and
Nat

sha
could
not
help
joining
in





No

but
don


t
you
think
it


s
nice




she
kept
repeating





Nice

And
so
you
no
longer
wish
to
marry
Bor

s





Nat

sha
flared
up




I
don


t
want
to
marry
anyone

And
I


ll
tell
him
so
when
I
see
him








Dear
me




said
Rost

v





But
that


s
all
rubbish




Nat

sha
chattered
on




And
is
Den

sov
nice




she
asked





Yes

indeed








Oh

well
then

good
by

go
and
dress

Is
he
very
terrible

Den

sov








Why
terrible




asked
Nicholas




No

V

ska
is
a
splendid
fellow








You
call
him
V

ska

That


s
funny

And
is
he
very
nice








Very








Well
then

be
quick

We


ll
all
have
breakfast
together





And
Nat

sha
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
on
tiptoe

like
a
ballet
dancer

but
smiling
as
only
happy
girls
of
fifteen
can
smile

When
Rost

v
met
S

nya
in
the
drawing
room

he
reddened

He
did
not
know
how
to
behave
with
her

The
evening
before

in
the
first
happy
moment
of
meeting

they
had
kissed
each
other

but
today
they
felt
it
could
not
be
done

he
felt
that
everybody

including
his
mother
and
sisters

was
looking
inquiringly
at
him
and
watching
to
see
how
he
would
behave
with
her

He
kissed
her
hand
and
addressed
her
not
as
thou
but
as
you


S

nya

But
their
eyes
met
and
said
thou

and
exchanged
tender
kisses

Her
looks
asked
him
to
forgive
her
for
having
dared

by
Nat

sha


s
intermediacy

to
remind
him
of
his
promise

and
then
thanked
him
for
his
love

His
looks
thanked
her
for
offering
him
his
freedom
and
told
her
that
one
way
or
another
he
would
never
cease
to
love
her

for
that
would
be
impossible





How
strange
it
is




said
V

ra

selecting
a
moment
when
all
were
silent




that
S

nya
and
Nicholas
now
say
you
to
one
another
and
meet
like
strangers





V

ra


s
remark
was
correct

as
her
remarks
always
were

but

like
most
of
her
observations

it
made
everyone
feel
uncomfortable

not
only
S

nya

Nicholas

and
Nat

sha

but
even
the
old
countess

who


dreading
this
love
affair
which
might
hinder
Nicholas
from
making
a
brilliant
match


blushed
like
a
girl


Den

sov

to
Rost

v


s
surprise

appeared
in
the
drawing
room
with
pomaded
hair

perfumed

and
in
a
new
uniform

looking
just
as
smart
as
he
made
himself
when
going
into
battle

and
he
was
more
amiable
to
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
than
Rost

v
had
ever
expected
to
see
him






CHAPTER
II

On
his
return
to
Moscow
from
the
army

Nicholas
Rost

v
was
welcomed
by
his
home
circle
as
the
best
of
sons

a
hero

and
their
darling
Nik

lenka

by
his
relations
as
a
charming

attractive

and
polite
young
man

by
his
acquaintances
as
a
handsome
lieutenant
of
hussars

a
good
dancer

and
one
of
the
best
matches
in
the
city


The
Rost

vs
knew
everybody
in
Moscow

The
old
count
had
money
enough
that
year

as
all
his
estates
had
been
remortgaged

and
so
Nicholas

acquiring
a
trotter
of
his
own

very
stylish
riding
breeches
of
the
latest
cut

such
as
no
one
else
yet
had
in
Moscow

and
boots
of
the
latest
fashion

with
extremely
pointed
toes
and
small
silver
spurs

passed
his
time
very
gaily

After
a
short
period
of
adapting
himself
to
the
old
conditions
of
life

Nicholas
found
it
very
pleasant
to
be
at
home
again

He
felt
that
he
had
grown
up
and
matured
very
much

His
despair
at
failing
in
a
Scripture
examination

his
borrowing
money
from
Gavr

l
to
pay
a
sleigh
driver

his
kissing
S

nya
on
the
sly


he
now
recalled
all
this
as
childishness
he
had
left
immeasurably
behind

Now
he
was
a
lieutenant
of
hussars

in
a
jacket
laced
with
silver

and
wearing
the
Cross
of
St

George

awarded
to
soldiers
for
bravery
in
action

and
in
the
company
of
well
known

elderly

and
respected
racing
men
was
training
a
trotter
of
his
own
for
a
race

He
knew
a
lady
on
one
of
the
boulevards
whom
he
visited
of
an
evening

He
led
the
mazurka
at
the
Arkh

rovs



ball

talked
about
the
war
with
Field
Marshal
K

menski

visited
the
English
Club

and
was
on
intimate
terms
with
a
colonel
of
forty
to
whom
Den

sov
had
introduced
him


His
passion
for
the
Emperor
had
cooled
somewhat
in
Moscow

But
still

as
he
did
not
see
him
and
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
him

he
often
spoke
about
him
and
about
his
love
for
him

letting
it
be
understood
that
he
had
not
told
all
and
that
there
was
something
in
his
feelings
for
the
Emperor
not
everyone
could
understand

and
with
his
whole
soul
he
shared
the
adoration
then
common
in
Moscow
for
the
Emperor

who
was
spoken
of
as
the



angel
incarnate





During
Rost

v


s
short
stay
in
Moscow

before
rejoining
the
army

he
did
not
draw
closer
to
S

nya

but
rather
drifted
away
from
her

She
was
very
pretty
and
sweet

and
evidently
deeply
in
love
with
him

but
he
was
at
the
period
of
youth
when
there
seems
so
much
to
do
that
there
is
no
time
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
a
young
man
fears
to
bind
himself
and
prizes
his
freedom
which
he
needs
for
so
many
other
things

When
he
thought
of
S

nya

during
this
stay
in
Moscow

he
said
to
himself




Ah

there
will
be

and
there
are

many
more
such
girls
somewhere
whom
I
do
not
yet
know

There
will
be
time
enough
to
think
about
love
when
I
want
to

but
now
I
have
no
time




Besides

it
seemed
to
him
that
the
society
of
women
was
rather
derogatory
to
his
manhood

He
went
to
balls
and
into
ladies



society
with
an
affectation
of
doing
so
against
his
will

The
races

the
English
Club

sprees
with
Den

sov

and
visits
to
a
certain
house


that
was
another
matter
and
quite
the
thing
for
a
dashing
young
hussar


At
the
beginning
of
March

old
Count
Ily


Rost

v
was
very
busy
arranging
a
dinner
in
honor
of
Prince
Bagrati

n
at
the
English
Club


The
count
walked
up
and
down
the
hall
in
his
dressing
gown

giving
orders
to
the
club
steward
and
to
the
famous
Feokt

st

the
club


s
head
cook

about
asparagus

fresh
cucumbers

strawberries

veal

and
fish
for
this
dinner

The
count
had
been
a
member
and
on
the
committee
of
the
club
from
the
day
it
was
founded

To
him
the
club
entrusted
the
arrangement
of
the
festival
in
honor
of
Bagrati

n

for
few
men
knew
so
well
how
to
arrange
a
feast
on
an
open
handed

hospitable
scale

and
still
fewer
men
would
be
so
well
able
and
willing
to
make
up
out
of
their
own
resources
what
might
be
needed
for
the
success
of
the
fete

The
club
cook
and
the
steward
listened
to
the
count


s
orders
with
pleased
faces

for
they
knew
that
under
no
other
management
could
they
so
easily
extract
a
good
profit
for
themselves
from
a
dinner
costing
several
thousand
rubles





Well
then

mind
and
have
cocks



comb
in
the
turtle
soup

you
know








Shall
we
have
three
cold
dishes
then




asked
the
cook


The
count
considered





We
can


t
have
less


yes

three



the
mayonnaise

that


s
one




said
he

bending
down
a
finger





Then
am
I
to
order
those
large
sterlets




asked
the
steward





Yes

it
can


t
be
helped
if
they
won


t
take
less

Ah

dear
me

I
was
forgetting

We
must
have
another
entr

e

Ah

goodness
gracious




he
clutched
at
his
head




Who
is
going
to
get
me
the
flowers

Dm

tri

Eh

Dm

tri

Gallop
off
to
our
Moscow
estate




he
said
to
the
factotum
who
appeared
at
his
call




Hurry
off
and
tell
Maks

m

the
gardener

to
set
the
serfs
to
work

Say
that
everything
out
of
the
hothouses
must
be
brought
here
well
wrapped
up
in
felt

I
must
have
two
hundred
pots
here
on
Friday





Having
given
several
more
orders

he
was
about
to
go
to
his



little
countess



to
have
a
rest

but
remembering
something
else
of
importance

he
returned
again

called
back
the
cook
and
the
club
steward

and
again
began
giving
orders

A
light
footstep
and
the
clinking
of
spurs
were
heard
at
the
door

and
the
young
count

handsome

rosy

with
a
dark
little
mustache

evidently
rested
and
made
sleeker
by
his
easy
life
in
Moscow

entered
the
room





Ah

my
boy

my
head


s
in
a
whirl




said
the
old
man
with
a
smile

as
if
he
felt
a
little
confused
before
his
son




Now

if
you
would
only
help
a
bit

I
must
have
singers
too

I
shall
have
my
own
orchestra

but
shouldn


t
we
get
the
gypsy
singers
as
well

You
military
men
like
that
sort
of
thing








Really

Papa

I
believe
Prince
Bagrati

n
worried
himself
less
before
the
battle
of
Sch

n
Grabern
than
you
do
now




said
his
son
with
a
smile


The
old
count
pretended
to
be
angry





Yes

you
talk

but
try
it
yourself





And
the
count
turned
to
the
cook

who

with
a
shrewd
and
respectful
expression

looked
observantly
and
sympathetically
at
the
father
and
son





What
have
the
young
people
come
to
nowadays

eh

Feokt

st




said
he




Laughing
at
us
old
fellows








That


s
so

your
excellency

all
they
have
to
do
is
to
eat
a
good
dinner

but
providing
it
and
serving
it
all
up

that


s
not
their
business








That


s
it

that


s
it




exclaimed
the
count

and
gaily
seizing
his
son
by
both
hands

he
cried




Now
I


ve
got
you

so
take
the
sleigh
and
pair
at
once

and
go
to
Bez

khov


s

and
tell
him



Count
Ily


has
sent
you
to
ask
for
strawberries
and
fresh
pineapples




We
can


t
get
them
from
anyone
else

He


s
not
there
himself

so
you


ll
have
to
go
in
and
ask
the
princesses

and
from
there
go
on
to
the
Rasguly

y


the
coachman
Ip

tka
knows


and
look
up
the
gypsy
Ily

shka

the
one
who
danced
at
Count
Orl

v


s

you
remember

in
a
white
Cossack
coat

and
bring
him
along
to
me








And
am
I
to
bring
the
gypsy
girls
along
with
him




asked
Nicholas

laughing




Dear

dear








At
that
moment

with
noiseless
footsteps
and
with
the
businesslike

preoccupied

yet
meekly
Christian
look
which
never
left
her
face

Anna
Mikh

ylovna
entered
the
hall

Though
she
came
upon
the
count
in
his
dressing
gown
every
day

he
invariably
became
confused
and
begged
her
to
excuse
his
costume





No
matter
at
all

my
dear
count




she
said

meekly
closing
her
eyes




But
I


ll
go
to
Bez

khov


s
myself

Pierre
has
arrived

and
now
we
shall
get
anything
we
want
from
his
hothouses

I
have
to
see
him
in
any
case

He
has
forwarded
me
a
letter
from
Bor

s

Thank
God

Bor

s
is
now
on
the
staff





The
count
was
delighted
at
Anna
Mikh

ylovna


s
taking
upon
herself
one
of
his
commissions
and
ordered
the
small
closed
carriage
for
her





Tell
Bez

khov
to
come

I


ll
put
his
name
down

Is
his
wife
with
him




he
asked


Anna
Mikh

ylovna
turned
up
her
eyes

and
profound
sadness
was
depicted
on
her
face





Ah

my
dear
friend

he
is
very
unfortunate




she
said




If
what
we
hear
is
true

it
is
dreadful

How
little
we
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
when
we
were
rejoicing
at
his
happiness

And
such
a
lofty
angelic
soul
as
young
Bez

khov

Yes

I
pity
him
from
my
heart

and
shall
try
to
give
him
what
consolation
I
can








Wh
what
is
the
matter




asked
both
the
young
and
old
Rost

v


Anna
Mikh

ylovna
sighed
deeply





D

lokhov

Mary
Iv

novna


s
son




she
said
in
a
mysterious
whisper




has
compromised
her
completely

they
say

Pierre
took
him
up

invited
him
to
his
house
in
Petersburg

and
now



she
has
come
here
and
that
daredevil
after
her




said
Anna
Mikh

ylovna

wishing
to
show
her
sympathy
for
Pierre

but
by
involuntary
intonations
and
a
half
smile
betraying
her
sympathy
for
the



daredevil




as
she
called
D

lokhov




They
say
Pierre
is
quite
broken
by
his
misfortune








Dear

dear

But
still
tell
him
to
come
to
the
club


it
will
all
blow
over

It
will
be
a
tremendous
banquet





Next
day

the
third
of
March

soon
after
one
o


clock

two
hundred
and
fifty
members
of
the
English
Club
and
fifty
guests
were
awaiting
the
guest
of
honor
and
hero
of
the
Austrian
campaign

Prince
Bagrati

n

to
dinner


On
the
first
arrival
of
the
news
of
the
battle
of
Austerlitz

Moscow
had
been
bewildered

At
that
time

the
Russians
were
so
used
to
victories
that
on
receiving
news
of
the
defeat
some
would
simply
not
believe
it

while
others
sought
some
extraordinary
explanation
of
so
strange
an
event

In
the
English
Club

where
all
who
were
distinguished

important

and
well
informed
foregathered
when
the
news
began
to
arrive
in
December

nothing
was
said
about
the
war
and
the
last
battle

as
though
all
were
in
a
conspiracy
of
silence

The
men
who
set
the
tone
in
conversation


Count
Rostopch

n

Prince
Y

ri
Dolgor

kov

Val

ev

Count
Mark

v

and
Prince
Vy

zemski


did
not
show
themselves
at
the
club

but
met
in
private
houses
in
intimate
circles

and
the
Moscovites
who
took
their
opinions
from
others


Ily


Rost

v
among
them


remained
for
a
while
without
any
definite
opinion
on
the
subject
of
the
war
and
without
leaders

The
Moscovites
felt
that
something
was
wrong
and
that
to
discuss
the
bad
news
was
difficult

and
so
it
was
best
to
be
silent

But
after
a
while

just
as
a
jury
comes
out
of
its
room

the
bigwigs
who
guided
the
club


s
opinion
reappeared

and
everybody
began
speaking
clearly
and
definitely

Reasons
were
found
for
the
incredible

unheard
of

and
impossible
event
of
a
Russian
defeat

everything
became
clear

and
in
all
corners
of
Moscow
the
same
things
began
to
be
said

These
reasons
were
the
treachery
of
the
Austrians

a
defective
commissariat

the
treachery
of
the
Pole
Przebysz

wski
and
of
the
Frenchman
Langeron

Kut

zov


s
incapacity

and

it
was
whispered

the
youth
and
inexperience
of
the
sovereign

who
had
trusted
worthless
and
insignificant
people

But
the
army

the
Russian
army

everyone
declared

was
extraordinary
and
had
achieved
miracles
of
valor

The
soldiers

officers

and
generals
were
heroes

But
the
hero
of
heroes
was
Prince
Bagrati

n

distinguished
by
his
Sch

n
Grabern
affair
and
by
the
retreat
from
Austerlitz

where
he
alone
had
withdrawn
his
column
unbroken
and
had
all
day
beaten
back
an
enemy
force
twice
as
numerous
as
his
own

What
also
conduced
to
Bagrati

n


s
being
selected
as
Moscow


s
hero
was
the
fact
that
he
had
no
connections
in
the
city
and
was
a
stranger
there

In
his
person

honor
was
shown
to
a
simple
fighting
Russian
soldier
without
connections
and
intrigues

and
to
one
who
was
associated
by
memories
of
the
Italian
campaign
with
the
name
of
Suv

rov

Moreover

paying
such
honor
to
Bagrati

n
was
the
best
way
of
expressing
disapproval
and
dislike
of
Kut

zov





Had
there
been
no
Bagrati

n

it
would
have
been
necessary
to
invent
him




said
the
wit
Shinsh

n

parodying
the
words
of
Voltaire

Kut

zov
no
one
spoke
of

except
some
who
abused
him
in
whispers

calling
him
a
court
weathercock
and
an
old
satyr


All
Moscow
repeated
Prince
Dolgor

kov


s
saying




If
you
go
on
modeling
and
modeling
you
must
get
smeared
with
clay




suggesting
consolation
for
our
defeat
by
the
memory
of
former
victories

and
the
words
of
Rostopch

n

that
French
soldiers
have
to
be
incited
to
battle
by
highfalutin
words

and
Germans
by
logical
arguments
to
show
them
that
it
is
more
dangerous
to
run
away
than
to
advance

but
that
Russian
soldiers
only
need
to
be
restrained
and
held
back

On
all
sides

new
and
fresh
anecdotes
were
heard
of
individual
examples
of
heroism
shown
by
our
officers
and
men
at
Austerlitz

One
had
saved
a
standard

another
had
killed
five
Frenchmen

a
third
had
loaded
five
cannon
singlehanded

Berg
was
mentioned

by
those
who
did
not
know
him

as
having

when
wounded
in
the
right
hand

taken
his
sword
in
the
left

and
gone
forward

Of
Bolk

nski

nothing
was
said

and
only
those
who
knew
him
intimately
regretted
that
he
had
died
so
young

leaving
a
pregnant
wife
with
his
eccentric
father






CHAPTER
III

On
that
third
of
March

all
the
rooms
in
the
English
Club
were
filled
with
a
hum
of
conversation

like
the
hum
of
bees
swarming
in
springtime

The
members
and
guests
of
the
club
wandered
hither
and
thither

sat

stood

met

and
separated

some
in
uniform
and
some
in
evening
dress

and
a
few
here
and
there
with
powdered
hair
and
in
Russian
kaft

ns

Powdered
footmen

in
livery
with
buckled
shoes
and
smart
stockings

stood
at
every
door
anxiously
noting
visitors



every
movement
in
order
to
offer
their
services

Most
of
those
present
were
elderly

respected
men
with
broad

self
confident
faces

fat
fingers

and
resolute
gestures
and
voices

This
class
of
guests
and
members
sat
in
certain
habitual
places
and
met
in
certain
habitual
groups

A
minority
of
those
present
were
casual
guests


chiefly
young
men

among
whom
were
Den

sov

Rost

v

and
D

lokhov


who
was
now
again
an
officer
in
the
Sem

nov
regiment

The
faces
of
these
young
people

especially
those
who
were
military
men

bore
that
expression
of
condescending
respect
for
their
elders
which
seems
to
say
to
the
older
generation




We
are
prepared
to
respect
and
honor
you

but
all
the
same
remember
that
the
future
belongs
to
us





Nesv

tski
was
there
as
an
old
member
of
the
club

Pierre

who
at
his
wife


s
command
had
let
his
hair
grow
and
abandoned
his
spectacles

went
about
the
rooms
fashionably
dressed
but
looking
sad
and
dull

Here

as
elsewhere

he
was
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
subservience
to
his
wealth

and
being
in
the
habit
of
lording
it
over
these
people

he
treated
them
with
absent
minded
contempt


By
his
age
he
should
have
belonged
to
the
younger
men

but
by
his
wealth
and
connections
he
belonged
to
the
groups
of
old
and
honored
guests

and
so
he
went
from
one
group
to
another

Some
of
the
most
important
old
men
were
the
center
of
groups
which
even
strangers
approached
respectfully
to
hear
the
voices
of
well
known
men

The
largest
circles
formed
round
Count
Rostopch

n

Val

ev

and
Nar

shkin

Rostopch

n
was
describing
how
the
Russians
had
been
overwhelmed
by
flying
Austrians
and
had
had
to
force
their
way
through
them
with
bayonets


Val

ev
was
confidentially
telling
that
Uv

rov
had
been
sent
from
Petersburg
to
ascertain
what
Moscow
was
thinking
about
Austerlitz


In
the
third
circle

Nar

shkin
was
speaking
of
the
meeting
of
the
Austrian
Council
of
War
at
which
Suv

rov
crowed
like
a
cock
in
reply
to
the
nonsense
talked
by
the
Austrian
generals

Shinsh

n

standing
close
by

tried
to
make
a
joke

saying
that
Kut

zov
had
evidently
failed
to
learn
from
Suv

rov
even
so
simple
a
thing
as
the
art
of
crowing
like
a
cock

but
the
elder
members
glanced
severely
at
the
wit

making
him
feel
that
in
that
place
and
on
that
day

it
was
improper
to
speak
so
of
Kut

zov


Count
Ily


Rost

v

hurried
and
preoccupied

went
about
in
his
soft
boots
between
the
dining
and
drawing
rooms

hastily
greeting
the
important
and
unimportant

all
of
whom
he
knew

as
if
they
were
all
equals

while
his
eyes
occasionally
sought
out
his
fine
well
set
up
young
son

resting
on
him
and
winking
joyfully
at
him

Young
Rost

v
stood
at
a
window
with
D

lokhov

whose
acquaintance
he
had
lately
made
and
highly
valued

The
old
count
came
up
to
them
and
pressed
D

lokhov


s
hand





Please
come
and
visit
us



you
know
my
brave
boy



been
together
out
there



both
playing
the
hero



Ah

Vas

li
Ign

tovich



How
d


ye
do

old
fellow




he
said

turning
to
an
old
man
who
was
passing

but
before
he
had
finished
his
greeting
there
was
a
general
stir

and
a
footman
who
had
run
in
announced

with
a
frightened
face




He


s
arrived





Bells
rang

the
stewards
rushed
forward

and


like
rye
shaken
together
in
a
shovel


the
guests
who
had
been
scattered
about
in
different
rooms
came
together
and
crowded
in
the
large
drawing
room
by
the
door
of
the
ballroom


Bagrati

n
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
anteroom
without
hat
or
sword

which

in
accord
with
the
club
custom

he
had
given
up
to
the
hall
porter

He
had
no
lambskin
cap
on
his
head

nor
had
he
a
loaded
whip
over
his
shoulder

as
when
Rost

v
had
seen
him
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
Austerlitz

but
wore
a
tight
new
uniform
with
Russian
and
foreign
Orders

and
the
Star
of
St

George
on
his
left
breast

Evidently
just
before
coming
to
the
dinner
he
had
had
his
hair
and
whiskers
trimmed

which
changed
his
appearance
for
the
worse

There
was
something
na

vely
festive
in
his
air

which

in
conjunction
with
his
firm
and
virile
features

gave
him
a
rather
comical
expression

Beklesh

v
and
Theodore
Uv

rov

who
had
arrived
with
him

paused
at
the
doorway
to
allow
him

as
the
guest
of
honor

to
enter
first

Bagrati

n
was
embarrassed

not
wishing
to
avail
himself
of
their
courtesy

and
this
caused
some
delay
at
the
doors

but
after
all
he
did
at
last
enter
first

He
walked
shyly
and
awkwardly
over
the
parquet
floor
of
the
reception
room

not
knowing
what
to
do
with
his
hands

he
was
more
accustomed
to
walk
over
a
plowed
field
under
fire

as
he
had
done
at
the
head
of
the
Kursk
regiment
at
Sch

n
Grabern


and
he
would
have
found
that
easier

The
committeemen
met
him
at
the
first
door
and

expressing
their
delight
at
seeing
such
a
highly
honored
guest

took
possession
of
him
as
it
were

without
waiting
for
his
reply

surrounded
him

and
led
him
to
the
drawing
room

It
was
at
first
impossible
to
enter
the
drawing
room
door
for
the
crowd
of
members
and
guests
jostling
one
another
and
trying
to
get
a
good
look
at
Bagrati

n
over
each
other


s
shoulders

as
if
he
were
some
rare
animal

Count
Ily


Rost

v

laughing
and
repeating
the
words




Make
way

dear
boy

Make
way

make
way




pushed
through
the
crowd
more
energetically
than
anyone

led
the
guests
into
the
drawing
room

and
seated
them
on
the
center
sofa

The
bigwigs

the
most
respected
members
of
the
club

beset
the
new
arrivals

Count
Ily



again
thrusting
his
way
through
the
crowd

went
out
of
the
drawing
room
and
reappeared
a
minute
later
with
another
committeeman

carrying
a
large
silver
salver
which
he
presented
to
Prince
Bagrati

n

On
the
salver
lay
some
verses
composed
and
printed
in
the
hero


s
honor

Bagrati

n

on
seeing
the
salver

glanced
around
in
dismay

as
though
seeking
help

But
all
eyes
demanded
that
he
should
submit

Feeling
himself
in
their
power

he
resolutely
took
the
salver
with
both
hands
and
looked
sternly
and
reproachfully
at
the
count
who
had
presented
it
to
him

Someone
obligingly
took
the
dish
from
Bagrati

n

or
he
would

it
seemed

have
held
it
till
evening
and
have
gone
in
to
dinner
with
it

and
drew
his
attention
to
the
verses





Well

I
will
read
them

then




Bagrati

n
seemed
to
say

and

fixing
his
weary
eyes
on
the
paper

began
to
read
them
with
a
fixed
and
serious
expression

But
the
author
himself
took
the
verses
and
began
reading
them
aloud

Bagrati

n
bowed
his
head
and
listened





Bring
glory
then
to
Alexander


s
reign



And
on
the
throne
our
Titus
shield




A
dreaded
foe
be
thou

kindhearted
as
a
man




A
Rhipheus
at
home

a
Caesar
in
the
field




E


en
fortunate
Napoleon



Knows
by
experience

now

Bagrati

n




And
dare
not
Herculean
Russians
trouble




But
before
he
had
finished
reading

a
stentorian
major
domo
announced
that
dinner
was
ready

The
door
opened

and
from
the
dining
room
came
the
resounding
strains
of
the
polonaise





Conquest


s
joyful
thunder
waken




Triumph

valiant
Russians

now





and
Count
Rost

v

glancing
angrily
at
the
author
who
went
on
reading
his
verses

bowed
to
Bagrati

n

Everyone
rose

feeling
that
dinner
was
more
important
than
verses

and
Bagrati

n

again
preceding
all
the
rest

went
in
to
dinner

He
was
seated
in
the
place
of
honor
between
two
Alexanders


Beklesh

v
and
Nar

shkin


which
was
a
significant
allusion
to
the
name
of
the
sovereign

Three
hundred
persons
took
their
seats
in
the
dining
room

according
to
their
rank
and
importance

the
more
important
nearer
to
the
honored
guest

as
naturally
as
water
flows
deepest
where
the
land
lies
lowest


Just
before
dinner

Count
Ily


Rost

v
presented
his
son
to
Bagrati

n

who
recognized
him
and
said
a
few
words
to
him

disjointed
and
awkward

as
were
all
the
words
he
spoke
that
day

and
Count
Ily


looked
joyfully
and
proudly
around
while
Bagrati

n
spoke
to
his
son


Nicholas
Rost

v

with
Den

sov
and
his
new
acquaintance

D

lokhov

sat
almost
at
the
middle
of
the
table

Facing
them
sat
Pierre

beside
Prince
Nesv

tski

Count
Ily


Rost

v
with
the
other
members
of
the
committee
sat
facing
Bagrati

n
and

as
the
very
personification
of
Moscow
hospitality

did
the
honors
to
the
prince


His
efforts
had
not
been
in
vain

The
dinner

both
the
Lenten
and
the
other
fare

was
splendid

yet
he
could
not
feel
quite
at
ease
till
the
end
of
the
meal

He
winked
at
the
butler

whispered
directions
to
the
footmen

and
awaited
each
expected
dish
with
some
anxiety

Everything
was
excellent

With
the
second
course

a
gigantic
sterlet

at
sight
of
which
Ily


Rost

v
blushed
with
self
conscious
pleasure


the
footmen
began
popping
corks
and
filling
the
champagne
glasses

After
the
fish

which
made
a
certain
sensation

the
count
exchanged
glances
with
the
other
committeemen




There
will
be
many
toasts

it


s
time
to
begin




he
whispered

and
taking
up
his
glass

he
rose

All
were
silent

waiting
for
what
he
would
say





To
the
health
of
our
Sovereign

the
Emperor




he
cried

and
at
the
same
moment
his
kindly
eyes
grew
moist
with
tears
of
joy
and
enthusiasm

The
band
immediately
struck
up



Conquest


s
joyful
thunder
waken






All
rose
and
cried



Hurrah




Bagrati

n
also
rose
and
shouted



Hurrah




in
exactly
the
same
voice
in
which
he
had
shouted
it
on
the
field
at
Sch

n
Grabern

Young
Rost

v


s
ecstatic
voice
could
be
heard
above
the
three
hundred
others

He
nearly
wept




To
the
health
of
our
Sovereign

the
Emperor




he
roared




Hurrah




and
emptying
his
glass
at
one
gulp
he
dashed
it
to
the
floor

Many
followed
his
example

and
the
loud
shouting
continued
for
a
long
time

When
the
voices
subsided

the
footmen
cleared
away
the
broken
glass
and
everybody
sat
down
again

smiling
at
the
noise
they
had
made
and
exchanging
remarks

The
old
count
rose
once
more

glanced
at
a
note
lying
beside
his
plate

and
proposed
a
toast




To
the
health
of
the
hero
of
our
last
campaign

Prince
Peter
Iv

novich
Bagrati

n




and
again
his
blue
eyes
grew
moist




Hurrah




cried
the
three
hundred
voices
again

but
instead
of
the
band
a
choir
began
singing
a
cantata
composed
by
Paul
Iv

novich
Kut

zov





Russians

O


er
all
barriers
on




Courage

Bagrati

n




He

their
knees




etc


As
soon
as
the
singing
was
over

another
and
another
toast
was
proposed
and
Count
Ily


Rost

v
became
more
and
more
moved

more
glass
was
smashed

and
the
shouting
grew
louder

They
drank

to
the

to
all

and
to
all
the
club
guests

and
finally
to
Count
Ily


Rost

v
separately

as
the
organizer
of
the
banquet

At
that
toast

the
count
took
out
his
handkerchief
and

covering
his
face

wept
outright






CHAPTER
IV

Pierre
sat
opposite
D

lokhov
and
Nicholas
Rost

v

As
usual

he
ate
and
drank
much

and
eagerly

But
those
who
knew
him
intimately
noticed
that
some
great
change
had
come
over
him
that
day

He
was
silent
all
through
dinner
and
looked
about

blinking
and
scowling

or

with
fixed
eyes
and
a
look
of
complete
absent
mindedness

kept
rubbing
the
bridge
of
his
nose

His
face
was
depressed
and
gloomy

He
seemed
to
see
and
hear
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
and
to
be
absorbed
by
some
depressing
and
unsolved
problem


The
unsolved
problem
that
tormented
him
was
caused
by
hints
given
by
the
princess

his
cousin

at
Moscow

concerning
D

lokhov


s
intimacy
with
his
wife

and
by
an
anonymous
letter
he
had
received
that
morning

which
in
the
mean
jocular
way
common
to
anonymous
letters
said
that
he
saw
badly
through
his
spectacles

but
that
his
wife


s
connection
with
D

lokhov
was
a
secret
to
no
one
but
himself

Pierre
absolutely
disbelieved
both
the
princess



hints
and
the
letter

but
he
feared
now
to
look
at
D

lokhov

who
was
sitting
opposite
him

Every
time
he
chanced
to
meet
D

lokhov


s
handsome
insolent
eyes

Pierre
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
in
his
soul
and
turned
quickly
away

Involuntarily
recalling
his
wife


s
past
and
her
relations
with
D

lokhov

Pierre
saw
clearly
that
what
was
said
in
the
letter
might
be
true

or
might
at
least
seem
to
be
true
had
it
not
referred
to
his
wife

He
involuntarily
remembered
how
D

lokhov

who
had
fully
recovered
his
former
position
after
the
campaign

had
returned
to
Petersburg
and
come
to
him

Availing
himself
of
his
friendly
relations
with
Pierre
as
a
boon
companion

D

lokhov
had
come
straight
to
his
house

and
Pierre
had
put
him
up
and
lent
him
money

Pierre
recalled
how
H

l

ne
had
smilingly
expressed
disapproval
of
D

lokhov


s
living
at
their
house

and
how
cynically
D

lokhov
had
praised
his
wife


s
beauty
to
him
and
from
that
time
till
they
came
to
Moscow
had
not
left
them
for
a
day





Yes

he
is
very
handsome




thought
Pierre




and
I
know
him

It
would
be
particularly
pleasant
to
him
to
dishonor
my
name
and
ridicule
me

just
because
I
have
exerted
myself
on
his
behalf

befriended
him

and
helped
him

I
know
and
understand
what
a
spice
that
would
add
to
the
pleasure
of
deceiving
me

if
it
really
were
true

Yes

if
it
were
true

but
I
do
not
believe
it

I
have
no
right
to

and
can


t

believe
it




He
remembered
the
expression
D

lokhov


s
face
assumed
in
his
moments
of
cruelty

as
when
tying
the
policeman
to
the
bear
and
dropping
them
into
the
water

or
when
he
challenged
a
man
to
a
duel
without
any
reason

or
shot
a
post
boy


s
horse
with
a
pistol

That
expression
was
often
on
D

lokhov


s
face
when
looking
at
him




Yes

he
is
a
bully




thought
Pierre




to
kill
a
man
means
nothing
to
him

It
must
seem
to
him
that
everyone
is
afraid
of
him

and
that
must
please
him

He
must
think
that
I

too

am
afraid
of
him


and
in
fact
I
am
afraid
of
him




he
thought

and
again
he
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
in
his
soul

D

lokhov

Den

sov

and
Rost

v
were
now
sitting
opposite
Pierre
and
seemed
very
gay

Rost

v
was
talking
merrily
to
his
two
friends

one
of
whom
was
a
dashing
hussar
and
the
other
a
notorious
duelist
and
rake

and
every
now
and
then
he
glanced
ironically
at
Pierre

whose
preoccupied

absent
minded

and
massive
figure
was
a
very
noticeable
one
at
the
dinner

Rost

v
looked
inimically
at
Pierre

first
because
Pierre
appeared
to
his
hussar
eyes
as
a
rich
civilian

the
husband
of
a
beauty

and
in
a
word


an
old
woman

and
secondly
because
Pierre
in
his
preoccupation
and
absent
mindedness
had
not
recognized
Rost

v
and
had
not
responded
to
his
greeting

When
the
Emperor


s
health
was
drunk

Pierre

lost
in
thought

did
not
rise
or
lift
his
glass





What
are
you
about




shouted
Rost

v

looking
at
him
in
an
ecstasy
of
exasperation




Don


t
you
hear
it


s
His
Majesty
the
Emperor


s
health





Pierre
sighed

rose
submissively

emptied
his
glass

and

waiting
till
all
were
seated
again

turned
with
his
kindly
smile
to
Rost

v





Why

I
didn


t
recognize
you




he
said

But
Rost

v
was
otherwise
engaged

he
was
shouting



Hurrah








Why
don


t
you
renew
the
acquaintance




said
D

lokhov
to
Rost

v





Confound
him

he


s
a
fool




said
Rost

v





One
should
make
up
to
the
husbands
of
pretty
women




said
Den

sov


Pierre
did
not
catch
what
they
were
saying

but
knew
they
were
talking
about
him

He
reddened
and
turned
away





Well

now
to
the
health
of
handsome
women




said
D

lokhov

and
with
a
serious
expression

but
with
a
smile
lurking
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth

he
turned
with
his
glass
to
Pierre





Here


s
to
the
health
of
lovely
women

Peterkin


and
their
lovers




he
added


Pierre

with
downcast
eyes

drank
out
of
his
glass
without
looking
at
D

lokhov
or
answering
him

The
footman

who
was
distributing
leaflets
with
Kut

zov


s
cantata

laid
one
before
Pierre
as
one
of
the
principal
guests

He
was
just
going
to
take
it
when
D

lokhov

leaning
across

snatched
it
from
his
hand
and
began
reading
it

Pierre
looked
at
D

lokhov
and
his
eyes
dropped

the
something
terrible
and
monstrous
that
had
tormented
him
all
dinnertime
rose
and
took
possession
of
him

He
leaned
his
whole
massive
body
across
the
table





How
dare
you
take
it




he
shouted


Hearing
that
cry
and
seeing
to
whom
it
was
addressed

Nesv

tski
and
the
neighbor
on
his
right
quickly
turned
in
alarm
to
Bez

khov





Don


t

Don


t

What
are
you
about




whispered
their
frightened
voices


D

lokhov
looked
at
Pierre
with
clear

mirthful

cruel
eyes

and
that
smile
of
his
which
seemed
to
say




Ah

This
is
what
I
like








You
shan


t
have
it




he
said
distinctly


Pale

with
quivering
lips

Pierre
snatched
the
copy





You




you



scoundrel

I
challenge
you




he
ejaculated

and

pushing
back
his
chair

he
rose
from
the
table


At
the
very
instant
he
did
this
and
uttered
those
words

Pierre
felt
that
the
question
of
his
wife


s
guilt
which
had
been
tormenting
him
the
whole
day
was
finally
and
indubitably
answered
in
the
affirmative

He
hated
her
and
was
forever
sundered
from
her

Despite
Den

sov


s
request
that
he
would
take
no
part
in
the
matter

Rost

v
agreed
to
be
D

lokhov


s
second

and
after
dinner
he
discussed
the
arrangements
for
the
duel
with
Nesv

tski

Bez

khov


s
second

Pierre
went
home

but
Rost

v
with
D

lokhov
and
Den

sov
stayed
on
at
the
club
till
late

listening
to
the
gypsies
and
other
singers





Well
then

till
tomorrow
at
Sok

lniki




said
D

lokhov

as
he
took
leave
of
Rost

v
in
the
club
porch





And
do
you
feel
quite
calm




Rost

v
asked


D

lokhov
paused





Well

you
see

I


ll
tell
you
the
whole
secret
of
dueling
in
two
words

If
you
are
going
to
fight
a
duel

and
you
make
a
will
and
write
affectionate
letters
to
your
parents

and
if
you
think
you
may
be
killed

you
are
a
fool
and
are
lost
for
certain

But
go
with
the
firm
intention
of
killing
your
man
as
quickly
and
surely
as
possible

and
then
all
will
be
right

as
our
bear
huntsman
at
Kostrom


used
to
tell
me




Everyone
fears
a
bear




he
says




but
when
you
see
one
your
fear


s
all
gone

and
your
only
thought
is
not
to
let
him
get
away




And
that


s
how
it
is
with
me




demain

mon
cher













Till
tomorrow

my
dear
fellow


Next
day

at
eight
in
the
morning

Pierre
and
Nesv

tski
drove
to
the
Sok

lniki
forest
and
found
D

lokhov

Den

sov

and
Rost

v
already
there

Pierre
had
the
air
of
a
man
preoccupied
with
considerations
which
had
no
connection
with
the
matter
in
hand

His
haggard
face
was
yellow

He
had
evidently
not
slept
that
night

He
looked
about
distractedly
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
as
if
dazzled
by
the
sun

He
was
entirely
absorbed
by
two
considerations

his
wife


s
guilt

of
which
after
his
sleepless
night
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt

and
the
guiltlessness
of
D

lokhov

who
had
no
reason
to
preserve
the
honor
of
a
man
who
was
nothing
to
him







I
should
perhaps
have
done
the
same
thing
in
his
place




thought
Pierre




It


s
even
certain
that
I
should
have
done
the
same

then
why
this
duel

this
murder

Either
I
shall
kill
him

or
he
will
hit
me
in
the
head

or
elbow

or
knee

Can


t
I
go
away
from
here

run
away

bury
myself
somewhere




passed
through
his
mind

But
just
at
moments
when
such
thoughts
occurred
to
him

he
would
ask
in
a
particularly
calm
and
absent
minded
way

which
inspired
the
respect
of
the
onlookers




Will
it
be
long

Are
things
ready





When
all
was
ready

the
sabers
stuck
in
the
snow
to
mark
the
barriers

and
the
pistols
loaded

Nesv

tski
went
up
to
Pierre





I
should
not
be
doing
my
duty

Count




he
said
in
timid
tones




and
should
not
justify
your
confidence
and
the
honor
you
have
done
me
in
choosing
me
for
your
second

if
at
this
grave

this
very
grave

moment
I
did
not
tell
you
the
whole
truth

I
think
there
is
no
sufficient
ground
for
this
affair

or
for
blood
to
be
shed
over
it




You
were
not
right

not
quite
in
the
right

you
were
impetuous










Oh
yes

it
is
horribly
stupid




said
Pierre





Then
allow
me
to
express
your
regrets

and
I
am
sure
your
opponent
will
accept
them




said
Nesv

tski

who
like
the
others
concerned
in
the
affair

and
like
everyone
in
similar
cases

did
not
yet
believe
that
the
affair
had
come
to
an
actual
duel





You
know

Count

it
is
much
more
honorable
to
admit
one


s
mistake
than
to
let
matters
become
irreparable

There
was
no
insult
on
either
side

Allow
me
to
convey











No

What
is
there
to
talk
about




said
Pierre




It


s
all
the
same




Is
everything
ready




he
added




Only
tell
me
where
to
go
and
where
to
shoot




he
said
with
an
unnaturally
gentle
smile


He
took
the
pistol
in
his
hand
and
began
asking
about
the
working
of
the
trigger

as
he
had
not
before
held
a
pistol
in
his
hand


a
fact
that
he
did
not
wish
to
confess





Oh
yes

like
that

I
know

I
only
forgot




said
he





No
apologies

none
whatever




said
D

lokhov
to
Den

sov

who
on
his
side
had
been
attempting
a
reconciliation


and
he
also
went
up
to
the
appointed
place


The
spot
chosen
for
the
duel
was
some
eighty
paces
from
the
road

where
the
sleighs
had
been
left

in
a
small
clearing
in
the
pine
forest
covered
with
melting
snow

the
frost
having
begun
to
break
up
during
the
last
few
days

The
antagonists
stood
forty
paces
apart
at
the
farther
edge
of
the
clearing

The
seconds

measuring
the
paces

left
tracks
in
the
deep
wet
snow
between
the
place
where
they
had
been
standing
and
Nesv

tski


s
and
D

lokhov


s
sabers

which
were
stuck
into
the
ground
ten
paces
apart
to
mark
the
barrier

It
was
thawing
and
misty

at
forty
paces



distance
nothing
could
be
seen

For
three
minutes
all
had
been
ready

but
they
still
delayed
and
all
were
silent






CHAPTER
V




Well
begin




said
D

lokhov





All
right




said
Pierre

still
smiling
in
the
same
way

A
feeling
of
dread
was
in
the
air

It
was
evident
that
the
affair
so
lightly
begun
could
no
longer
be
averted
but
was
taking
its
course
independently
of
men


s
will


Den

sov
first
went
to
the
barrier
and
announced




As
the
adve


sawies
have
wefused
a
weconciliation

please
pwoceed

Take
your
pistols

and
at
the
word
thwee
begin
to
advance





O
ne

T
wo

Thwee




he
shouted
angrily
and
stepped
aside


The
combatants
advanced
along
the
trodden
tracks

nearer
and
nearer
to
one
another

beginning
to
see
one
another
through
the
mist

They
had
the
right
to
fire
when
they
liked
as
they
approached
the
barrier

D

lokhov
walked
slowly
without
raising
his
pistol

looking
intently
with
his
bright

sparkling
blue
eyes
into
his
antagonist


s
face

His
mouth
wore
its
usual
semblance
of
a
smile





So
I
can
fire
when
I
like




said
Pierre

and
at
the
word



three




he
went
quickly
forward

missing
the
trodden
path
and
stepping
into
the
deep
snow

He
held
the
pistol
in
his
right
hand
at
arm


s
length

apparently
afraid
of
shooting
himself
with
it

His
left
hand
he
held
carefully
back

because
he
wished
to
support
his
right
hand
with
it
and
knew
he
must
not
do
so

Having
advanced
six
paces
and
strayed
off
the
track
into
the
snow

Pierre
looked
down
at
his
feet

then
quickly
glanced
at
D

lokhov
and

bending
his
finger
as
he
had
been
shown

fired

Not
at
all
expecting
so
loud
a
report

Pierre
shuddered
at
the
sound
and
then

smiling
at
his
own
sensations

stood
still

The
smoke

rendered
denser
by
the
mist

prevented
him
from
seeing
anything
for
an
instant

but
there
was
no
second
report
as
he
had
expected

He
only
heard
D

lokhov


s
hurried
steps

and
his
figure
came
in
view
through
the
smoke

He
was
pressing
one
hand
to
his
left
side

while
the
other
clutched
his
drooping
pistol

His
face
was
pale

Rost

v
ran
toward
him
and
said
something





No
o
o




muttered
D

lokhov
through
his
teeth




no

it


s
not
over




And
after
stumbling
a
few
staggering
steps
right
up
to
the
saber

he
sank
on
the
snow
beside
it

His
left
hand
was
bloody

he
wiped
it
on
his
coat
and
supported
himself
with
it

His
frowning
face
was
pallid
and
quivered





Plea






began
D

lokhov

but
could
not
at
first
pronounce
the
word





Please




he
uttered
with
an
effort


Pierre

hardly
restraining
his
sobs

began
running
toward
D

lokhov
and
was
about
to
cross
the
space
between
the
barriers

when
D

lokhov
cried





To
your
barrier




and
Pierre

grasping
what
was
meant

stopped
by
his
saber

Only
ten
paces
divided
them

D

lokhov
lowered
his
head
to
the
snow

greedily
bit
at
it

again
raised
his
head

adjusted
himself

drew
in
his
legs
and
sat
up

seeking
a
firm
center
of
gravity

He
sucked
and
swallowed
the
cold
snow

his
lips
quivered
but
his
eyes

still
smiling

glittered
with
effort
and
exasperation
as
he
mustered
his
remaining
strength

He
raised
his
pistol
and
aimed





Sideways

Cover
yourself
with
your
pistol




ejaculated
Nesv

tski





Cover
yourself




even
Den

sov
cried
to
his
adversary


Pierre

with
a
gentle
smile
of
pity
and
remorse

his
arms
and
legs
helplessly
spread
out

stood
with
his
broad
chest
directly
facing
D

lokhov
and
looked
sorrowfully
at
him

Den

sov

Rost

v

and
Nesv

tski
closed
their
eyes

At
the
same
instant
they
heard
a
report
and
D

lokhov


s
angry
cry





Missed




shouted
D

lokhov

and
he
lay
helplessly

face
downwards
on
the
snow


Pierre
clutched
his
temples

and
turning
round
went
into
the
forest

trampling
through
the
deep
snow

and
muttering
incoherent
words





Folly



folly

Death



lies






he
repeated

puckering
his
face


Nesv

tski
stopped
him
and
took
him
home


Rost

v
and
Den

sov
drove
away
with
the
wounded
D

lokhov


The
latter
lay
silent
in
the
sleigh
with
closed
eyes
and
did
not
answer
a
word
to
the
questions
addressed
to
him

But
on
entering
Moscow
he
suddenly
came
to
and

lifting
his
head
with
an
effort

took
Rost

v

who
was
sitting
beside
him

by
the
hand

Rost

v
was
struck
by
the
totally
altered
and
unexpectedly
rapturous
and
tender
expression
on
D

lokhov


s
face





Well

How
do
you
feel




he
asked





Bad

But
it


s
not
that

my
friend






said
D

lokhov
with
a
gasping
voice




Where
are
we

In
Moscow

I
know

I
don


t
matter

but
I
have
killed
her

killed



She
won


t
get
over
it

She
won


t
survive











Who




asked
Rost

v





My
mother

My
mother

my
angel

my
adored
angel
mother




and
D

lokhov
pressed
Rost

v


s
hand
and
burst
into
tears


When
he
had
become
a
little
quieter

he
explained
to
Rost

v
that
he
was
living
with
his
mother

who

if
she
saw
him
dying

would
not
survive
it

He
implored
Rost

v
to
go
on
and
prepare
her


Rost

v
went
on
ahead
to
do
what
was
asked

and
to
his
great
surprise
learned
that
D

lokhov
the
brawler

D

lokhov
the
bully

lived
in
Moscow
with
an
old
mother
and
a
hunchback
sister

and
was
the
most
affectionate
of
sons
and
brothers






CHAPTER
VI

Pierre
had
of
late
rarely
seen
his
wife
alone

Both
in
Petersburg
and
in
Moscow
their
house
was
always
full
of
visitors

The
night
after
the
duel
he
did
not
go
to
his
bedroom
but

as
he
often
did

remained
in
his
father


s
room

that
huge
room
in
which
Count
Bez

khov
had
died


He
lay
down
on
the
sofa
meaning
to
fall
asleep
and
forget
all
that
had
happened
to
him

but
could
not
do
so

Such
a
storm
of
feelings

thoughts

and
memories
suddenly
arose
within
him
that
he
could
not
fall
asleep

nor
even
remain
in
one
place

but
had
to
jump
up
and
pace
the
room
with
rapid
steps

Now
he
seemed
to
see
her
in
the
early
days
of
their
marriage

with
bare
shoulders
and
a
languid

passionate
look
on
her
face

and
then
immediately
he
saw
beside
her
D

lokhov


s
handsome

insolent

hard

and
mocking
face
as
he
had
seen
it
at
the
banquet

and
then
that
same
face
pale

quivering

and
suffering

as
it
had
been
when
he
reeled
and
sank
on
the
snow





What
has
happened




he
asked
himself




I
have
killed
her
lover

yes

killed
my
wife


s
lover

Yes

that
was
it

And
why

How
did
I
come
to
do
it









Because
you
married
her




answered
an
inner
voice





But
in
what
was
I
to
blame




he
asked




In
marrying
her
without
loving
her

in
deceiving
yourself
and
her




And
he
vividly
recalled
that
moment
after
supper
at
Prince
Vas

li


s

when
he
spoke
those
words
he
had
found
so
difficult
to
utter




I
love
you







It
all
comes
from
that

Even
then
I
felt
it




he
thought




I
felt
then
that
it
was
not
so

that
I
had
no
right
to
do
it

And
so
it
turns
out





He
remembered
his
honeymoon
and
blushed
at
the
recollection

Particularly
vivid

humiliating

and
shameful
was
the
recollection
of
how
one
day
soon
after
his
marriage
he
came
out
of
the
bedroom
into
his
study
a
little
before
noon
in
his
silk
dressing
gown
and
found
his
head
steward
there

who

bowing
respectfully

looked
into
his
face
and
at
his
dressing
gown
and
smiled
slightly

as
if
expressing
respectful
understanding
of
his
employer


s
happiness





But
how
often
I
have
felt
proud
of
her

proud
of
her
majestic
beauty
and
social
tact




thought
he




been
proud
of
my
house

in
which
she
received
all
Petersburg

proud
of
her
unapproachability
and
beauty

So
this
is
what
I
was
proud
of

I
then
thought
that
I
did
not
understand
her

How
often
when
considering
her
character
I
have
told
myself
that
I
was
to
blame
for
not
understanding
her

for
not
understanding
that
constant
composure
and
complacency
and
lack
of
all
interests
or
desires

and
the
whole
secret
lies
in
the
terrible
truth
that
she
is
a
depraved
woman

Now
I
have
spoken
that
terrible
word
to
myself
all
has
become
clear





Anatole
used
to
come
to
borrow
money
from
her
and
used
to
kiss
her
naked
shoulders

She
did
not
give
him
the
money

but
let
herself
be
kissed

Her
father
in
jest
tried
to
rouse
her
jealousy

and
she
replied
with
a
calm
smile
that
she
was
not
so
stupid
as
to
be
jealous




Let
him
do
what
he
pleases




she
used
to
say
of
me

One
day
I
asked
her
if
she
felt
any
symptoms
of
pregnancy

She
laughed
contemptuously
and
said
she
was
not
a
fool
to
want
to
have
children

and
that
she
was
not
going
to
have
any
children
by
me





Then
he
recalled
the
coarseness
and
bluntness
of
her
thoughts
and
the
vulgarity
of
the
expressions
that
were
natural
to
her

though
she
had
been
brought
up
in
the
most
aristocratic
circles





I


m
not
such
a
fool




Just
you
try
it
on




Allez
vous
promener






she
used
to
say

Often
seeing
the
success
she
had
with
young
and
old
men
and
women
Pierre
could
not
understand
why
he
did
not
love
her











You
clear
out
of
this









Yes

I
never
loved
her




said
he
to
himself




I
knew
she
was
a
depraved
woman




he
repeated




but
dared
not
admit
it
to
myself

And
now
there


s
D

lokhov
sitting
in
the
snow
with
a
forced
smile
and
perhaps
dying

while
meeting
my
remorse
with
some
forced
bravado





Pierre
was
one
of
those
people
who

in
spite
of
an
appearance
of
what
is
called
weak
character

do
not
seek
a
confidant
in
their
troubles

He
digested
his
sufferings
alone





It
is
all

all
her
fault




he
said
to
himself




but
what
of
that

Why
did
I
bind
myself
to
her

Why
did
I
say



Je
vous
aime





to
her

which
was
a
lie

and
worse
than
a
lie

I
am
guilty
and
must
endure



what

A
slur
on
my
name

A
misfortune
for
life

Oh

that


s
nonsense




he
thought




The
slur
on
my
name
and
honor


that


s
all
apart
from
myself











I
love
you





Louis
XVI
was
executed
because
they
said
he
was
dishonorable
and
a
criminal




came
into
Pierre


s
head




and
from
their
point
of
view
they
were
right

as
were
those
too
who
canonized
him
and
died
a
martyr


s
death
for
his
sake

Then
Robespierre
was
beheaded
for
being
a
despot

Who
is
right
and
who
is
wrong

No
one

But
if
you
are
alive


live

tomorrow
you


ll
die
as
I
might
have
died
an
hour
ago

And
is
it
worth
tormenting
oneself

when
one
has
only
a
moment
of
life
in
comparison
with
eternity





But
at
the
moment
when
he
imagined
himself
calmed
by
such
reflections

she
suddenly
came
into
his
mind
as
she
was
at
the
moments
when
he
had
most
strongly
expressed
his
insincere
love
for
her

and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
and
had
again
to
get
up
and
move
about
and
break
and
tear
whatever
came
to
his
hand




Why
did
I
tell
her
that



Je
vous
aime







he
kept
repeating
to
himself

And
when
he
had
said
it
for
the
tenth
time

Moli

re


s
words




Mais
que
diable
allait
il
faire
dans
cette
gal

re






occurred
to
him

and
he
began
to
laugh
at
himself













But
what
the
devil
was
he
doing
in
that
galley






In
the
night
he
called
his
valet
and
told
him
to
pack
up
to
go
to
Petersburg

He
could
not
imagine
how
he
could
speak
to
her
now

He
resolved
to
go
away
next
day
and
leave
a
letter
informing
her
of
his
intention
to
part
from
her
forever


Next
morning
when
the
valet
came
into
the
room
with
his
coffee

Pierre
was
lying
asleep
on
the
ottoman
with
an
open
book
in
his
hand


He
woke
up
and
looked
round
for
a
while
with
a
startled
expression

unable
to
realize
where
he
was





The
countess
told
me
to
inquire
whether
your
excellency
was
at
home




said
the
valet


But
before
Pierre
could
decide
what
answer
he
would
send

the
countess
herself
in
a
white
satin
dressing
gown
embroidered
with
silver
and
with
simply
dressed
hair

two
immense
plaits
twice
round
her
lovely
head
like
a
coronet

entered
the
room

calm
and
majestic

except
that
there
was
a
wrathful
wrinkle
on
her
rather
prominent
marble
brow

With
her
imperturbable
calm
she
did
not
begin
to
speak
in
front
of
the
valet

She
knew
of
the
duel
and
had
come
to
speak
about
it

She
waited
till
the
valet
had
set
down
the
coffee
things
and
left
the
room

Pierre
looked
at
her
timidly
over
his
spectacles

and
like
a
hare
surrounded
by
hounds
who
lays
back
her
ears
and
continues
to
crouch
motionless
before
her
enemies

he
tried
to
continue
reading

But
feeling
this
to
be
senseless
and
impossible

he
again
glanced
timidly
at
her

She
did
not
sit
down
but
looked
at
him
with
a
contemptuous
smile

waiting
for
the
valet
to
go





Well

what


s
this
now

What
have
you
been
up
to
now

I
should
like
to
know




she
asked
sternly





I

What
have
I







stammered
Pierre





So
it
seems
you


re
a
hero

eh

Come
now

what
was
this
duel
about

What
is
it
meant
to
prove

What

I
ask
you





Pierre
turned
over
heavily
on
the
ottoman
and
opened
his
mouth

but
could
not
reply





If
you
won


t
answer

I


ll
tell
you






H

l

ne
went
on




You
believe
everything
you


re
told

You
were
told






H

l

ne
laughed




that
D

lokhov
was
my
lover




she
said
in
French
with
her
coarse
plainness
of
speech

uttering
the
word
amant
as
casually
as
any
other
word




and
you
believed
it

Well

what
have
you
proved

What
does
this
duel
prove

That
you


re
a
fool

que
vous


tes
un
sot

but
everybody
knew
that

What
will
be
the
result

That
I
shall
be
the
laughingstock
of
all
Moscow

that
everyone
will
say
that
you

drunk
and
not
knowing
what
you
were
about

challenged
a
man
you
are
jealous
of
without
cause




H

l

ne
raised
her
voice
and
became
more
and
more
excited




A
man
who


s
a
better
man
than
you
in
every
way










Hm



Hm







growled
Pierre

frowning
without
looking
at
her

and
not
moving
a
muscle





And
how
could
you
believe
he
was
my
lover

Why

Because
I
like
his
company

If
you
were
cleverer
and
more
agreeable

I
should
prefer
yours








Don


t
speak
to
me



I
beg
you




muttered
Pierre
hoarsely





Why
shouldn


t
I
speak

I
can
speak
as
I
like

and
I
tell
you
plainly
that
there
are
not
many
wives
with
husbands
such
as
you
who
would
not
have
taken
lovers

des
amants


but
I
have
not
done
so




said
she


Pierre
wished
to
say
something

looked
at
her
with
eyes
whose
strange
expression
she
did
not
understand

and
lay
down
again

He
was
suffering
physically
at
that
moment

there
was
a
weight
on
his
chest
and
he
could
not
breathe

He
knew
that
he
must
do
something
to
put
an
end
to
this
suffering

but
what
he
wanted
to
do
was
too
terrible





We
had
better
separate




he
muttered
in
a
broken
voice





Separate

Very
well

but
only
if
you
give
me
a
fortune




said
H

l

ne




Separate

That


s
a
thing
to
frighten
me
with





Pierre
leaped
up
from
the
sofa
and
rushed
staggering
toward
her





I


ll
kill
you




he
shouted

and
seizing
the
marble
top
of
a
table
with
a
strength
he
had
never
before
felt

he
made
a
step
toward
her
brandishing
the
slab


H

l

ne


s
face
became
terrible

she
shrieked
and
sprang
aside

His
father


s
nature
showed
itself
in
Pierre

He
felt
the
fascination
and
delight
of
frenzy

He
flung
down
the
slab

broke
it

and
swooping
down
on
her
with
outstretched
hands
shouted




Get
out




in
such
a
terrible
voice
that
the
whole
house
heard
it
with
horror

God
knows
what
he
would
have
done
at
that
moment
had
H

l

ne
not
fled
from
the
room



A
week
later
Pierre
gave
his
wife
full
power
to
control
all
his
estates
in
Great
Russia

which
formed
the
larger
part
of
his
property

and
left
for
Petersburg
alone






CHAPTER
VII

Two
months
had
elapsed
since
the
news
of
the
battle
of
Austerlitz
and
the
loss
of
Prince
Andrew
had
reached
Bald
Hills

and
in
spite
of
the
letters
sent
through
the
embassy
and
all
the
searches
made

his
body
had
not
been
found
nor
was
he
on
the
list
of
prisoners

What
was
worst
of
all
for
his
relations
was
the
fact
that
there
was
still
a
possibility
of
his
having
been
picked
up
on
the
battlefield
by
the
people
of
the
place
and
that
he
might
now
be
lying

recovering
or
dying

alone
among
strangers
and
unable
to
send
news
of
himself

The
gazettes
from
which
the
old
prince
first
heard
of
the
defeat
at
Austerlitz
stated

as
usual
very
briefly
and
vaguely

that
after
brilliant
engagements
the
Russians
had
had
to
retreat
and
had
made
their
withdrawal
in
perfect
order

The
old
prince
understood
from
this
official
report
that
our
army
had
been
defeated

A
week
after
the
gazette
report
of
the
battle
of
Austerlitz
came
a
letter
from
Kut

zov
informing
the
prince
of
the
fate
that
had
befallen
his
son





Your
son




wrote
Kut

zov




fell
before
my
eyes

a
standard
in
his
hand
and
at
the
head
of
a
regiment


he
fell
as
a
hero

worthy
of
his
father
and
his
fatherland

To
the
great
regret
of
myself
and
of
the
whole
army
it
is
still
uncertain
whether
he
is
alive
or
not

I
comfort
myself
and
you
with
the
hope
that
your
son
is
alive

for
otherwise
he
would
have
been
mentioned
among
the
officers
found
on
the
field
of
battle

a
list
of
whom
has
been
sent
me
under
flag
of
truce





After
receiving
this
news
late
in
the
evening

when
he
was
alone
in
his
study

the
old
prince
went
for
his
walk
as
usual
next
morning

but
he
was
silent
with
his
steward

the
gardener

and
the
architect

and
though
he
looked
very
grim
he
said
nothing
to
anyone


When
Princess
Mary
went
to
him
at
the
usual
hour
he
was
working
at
his
lathe
and

as
usual

did
not
look
round
at
her





Ah

Princess
Mary




he
said
suddenly
in
an
unnatural
voice

throwing
down
his
chisel


The
wheel
continued
to
revolve
by
its
own
impetus

and
Princess
Mary
long
remembered
the
dying
creak
of
that
wheel

which
merged
in
her
memory
with
what
followed



She
approached
him

saw
his
face

and
something
gave
way
within
her

Her
eyes
grew
dim

By
the
expression
of
her
father


s
face

not
sad

not
crushed

but
angry
and
working
unnaturally

she
saw
that
hanging
over
her
and
about
to
crush
her
was
some
terrible
misfortune

the
worst
in
life

one
she
had
not
yet
experienced

irreparable
and
incomprehensible


the
death
of
one
she
loved





Father

Andrew






said
the
ungraceful

awkward
princess
with
such
an
indescribable
charm
of
sorrow
and
self
forgetfulness
that
her
father
could
not
bear
her
look
but
turned
away
with
a
sob





Bad
news

He


s
not
among
the
prisoners
nor
among
the
killed

Kut

zov
writes






and
he
screamed
as
piercingly
as
if
he
wished
to
drive
the
princess
away
by
that
scream






Killed





The
princess
did
not
fall
down
or
faint

She
was
already
pale

but
on
hearing
these
words
her
face
changed
and
something
brightened
in
her
beautiful

radiant
eyes

It
was
as
if
joy


a
supreme
joy
apart
from
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
this
world


overflowed
the
great
grief
within
her

She
forgot
all
fear
of
her
father

went
up
to
him

took
his
hand

and
drawing
him
down
put
her
arm
round
his
thin

scraggy
neck





Father




she
said




do
not
turn
away
from
me

let
us
weep
together








Scoundrels

Blackguards




shrieked
the
old
man

turning
his
face
away
from
her




Destroying
the
army

destroying
the
men

And
why

Go

go
and
tell
Lise





The
princess
sank
helplessly
into
an
armchair
beside
her
father
and
wept

She
saw
her
brother
now
as
he
had
been
at
the
moment
when
he
took
leave
of
her
and
of
Lise

his
look
tender
yet
proud

She
saw
him
tender
and
amused
as
he
was
when
he
put
on
the
little
icon




Did
he
believe

Had
he
repented
of
his
unbelief

Was
he
now
there

There
in
the
realms
of
eternal
peace
and
blessedness




she
thought





Father

tell
me
how
it
happened




she
asked
through
her
tears





Go

Go

Killed
in
battle

where
the
best
of
Russian
men
and
Russia


s
glory
were
led
to
destruction

Go

Princess
Mary

Go
and
tell
Lise

I
will
follow





When
Princess
Mary
returned
from
her
father

the
little
princess
sat
working
and
looked
up
with
that
curious
expression
of
inner

happy
calm
peculiar
to
pregnant
women

It
was
evident
that
her
eyes
did
not
see
Princess
Mary
but
were
looking
within



into
herself



at
something
joyful
and
mysterious
taking
place
within
her





Mary




she
said

moving
away
from
the
embroidery
frame
and
lying
back




give
me
your
hand




She
took
her
sister
in
law


s
hand
and
held
it
below
her
waist


Her
eyes
were
smiling
expectantly

her
downy
lip
rose
and
remained
lifted
in
childlike
happiness


Princess
Mary
knelt
down
before
her
and
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
her
sister
in
law


s
dress





There

there

Do
you
feel
it

I
feel
so
strange

And
do
you
know

Mary

I
am
going
to
love
him
very
much




said
Lise

looking
with
bright
and
happy
eyes
at
her
sister
in
law


Princess
Mary
could
not
lift
her
head

she
was
weeping





What
is
the
matter

Mary








Nothing



only
I
feel
sad



sad
about
Andrew




she
said

wiping
away
her
tears
on
her
sister
in
law


s
knee


Several
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
Princess
Mary
began
trying
to
prepare
her
sister
in
law

and
every
time
began
to
cry

Unobservant
as
was
the
little
princess

these
tears

the
cause
of
which
she
did
not
understand

agitated
her

She
said
nothing
but
looked
about
uneasily
as
if
in
search
of
something

Before
dinner
the
old
prince

of
whom
she
was
always
afraid

came
into
her
room
with
a
peculiarly
restless
and
malign
expression
and
went
out
again
without
saying
a
word

She
looked
at
Princess
Mary

then
sat
thinking
for
a
while
with
that
expression
of
attention
to
something
within
her
that
is
only
seen
in
pregnant
women

and
suddenly
began
to
cry





Has
anything
come
from
Andrew




she
asked





No

you
know
it


s
too
soon
for
news

But
my
father
is
anxious
and
I
feel
afraid








So
there


s
nothing








Nothing




answered
Princess
Mary

looking
firmly
with
her
radiant
eyes
at
her
sister
in
law


She
had
determined
not
to
tell
her
and
persuaded
her
father
to
hide
the
terrible
news
from
her
till
after
her
confinement

which
was
expected
within
a
few
days

Princess
Mary
and
the
old
prince
each
bore
and
hid
their
grief
in
their
own
way

The
old
prince
would
not
cherish
any
hope

he
made
up
his
mind
that
Prince
Andrew
had
been
killed

and
though
he
sent
an
official
to
Austria
to
seek
for
traces
of
his
son

he
ordered
a
monument
from
Moscow
which
he
intended
to
erect
in
his
own
garden
to
his
memory

and
he
told
everybody
that
his
son
had
been
killed

He
tried
not
to
change
his
former
way
of
life

but
his
strength
failed
him

He
walked
less

ate
less

slept
less

and
became
weaker
every
day

Princess
Mary
hoped

She
prayed
for
her
brother
as
living
and
was
always
awaiting
news
of
his
return






CHAPTER
VIII




Dearest




said
the
little
princess
after
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
March

and
her
downy
little
lip
rose
from
old
habit

but
as
sorrow
was
manifest
in
every
smile

the
sound
of
every
word

and
even
every
footstep
in
that
house
since
the
terrible
news
had
come

so
now
the
smile
of
the
little
princess


influenced
by
the
general
mood
though
without
knowing
its
cause


was
such
as
to
remind
one
still
more
of
the
general
sorrow





Dearest

I


m
afraid
this
morning


s
fruschtique




as
F

ka
the
cook
calls
it


has
disagreed
with
me











Fr

hst

ck

breakfast





What
is
the
matter
with
you

my
darling

You
look
pale

Oh

you
are
very
pale




said
Princess
Mary
in
alarm

running
with
her
soft

ponderous
steps
up
to
her
sister
in
law





Your
excellency

should
not
Mary
Bogd

novna
be
sent
for




said
one
of
the
maids
who
was
present


Mary
Bogd

novna
was
a
midwife
from
the
neighboring
town

who
had
been
at
Bald
Hills
for
the
last
fortnight






Oh
yes




assented
Princess
Mary




perhaps
that


s
it

I


ll
go

Courage

my
angel




She
kissed
Lise
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room





Oh

no

no




And
besides
the
pallor
and
the
physical
suffering
on
the
little
princess



face

an
expression
of
childish
fear
of
inevitable
pain
showed
itself





No

it


s
only
indigestion




Say
it


s
only
indigestion

say
so

Mary

Say






And
the
little
princess
began
to
cry
capriciously
like
a
suffering
child
and
to
wring
her
little
hands
even
with
some
affectation

Princess
Mary
ran
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
Mary
Bogd

novna





Mon
Dieu

Mon
Dieu

Oh




she
heard
as
she
left
the
room


The
midwife
was
already
on
her
way
to
meet
her

rubbing
her
small

plump
white
hands
with
an
air
of
calm
importance





Mary
Bogd

novna

I
think
it


s
beginning




said
Princess
Mary
looking
at
the
midwife
with
wide
open
eyes
of
alarm





Well

the
Lord
be
thanked

Princess




said
Mary
Bogd

novna

not
hastening
her
steps




You
young
ladies
should
not
know
anything
about
it








But
how
is
it
the
doctor
from
Moscow
is
not
here
yet




said
the
princess


In
accordance
with
Lise


s
and
Prince
Andrew


s
wishes
they
had
sent
in
good
time
to
Moscow
for
a
doctor
and
were
expecting
him
at
any
moment






No
matter

Princess

don


t
be
alarmed




said
Mary
Bogd

novna




We


ll
manage
very
well
without
a
doctor





Five
minutes
later
Princess
Mary
from
her
room
heard
something
heavy
being
carried
by

She
looked
out

The
men
servants
were
carrying
the
large
leather
sofa
from
Prince
Andrew


s
study
into
the
bedroom

On
their
faces
was
a
quiet
and
solemn
look


Princess
Mary
sat
alone
in
her
room
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
house

now
and
then
opening
her
door
when
someone
passed
and
watching
what
was
going
on
in
the
passage

Some
women
passing
with
quiet
steps
in
and
out
of
the
bedroom
glanced
at
the
princess
and
turned
away

She
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions

and
shut
the
door
again

now
sitting
down
in
her
easy
chair

now
taking
her
prayer
book

now
kneeling
before
the
icon
stand

To
her
surprise
and
distress
she
found
that
her
prayers
did
not
calm
her
excitement

Suddenly
her
door
opened
softly
and
her
old
nurse

Prask

vya
S

vishna

who
hardly
ever
came
to
that
room
as
the
old
prince
had
forbidden
it

appeared
on
the
threshold
with
a
shawl
round
her
head





I


ve
come
to
sit
with
you
a
bit

M

sha




said
the
nurse




and
here
I


ve
brought
the
prince


s
wedding
candles
to
light
before
his
saint

my
angel




she
said
with
a
sigh





Oh

nurse

I


m
so
glad








God
is
merciful

birdie





The
nurse
lit
the
gilt
candles
before
the
icons
and
sat
down
by
the
door
with
her
knitting

Princess
Mary
took
a
book
and
began
reading

Only
when
footsteps
or
voices
were
heard
did
they
look
at
one
another

the
princess
anxious
and
inquiring

the
nurse
encouraging

Everyone
in
the
house
was
dominated
by
the
same
feeling
that
Princess
Mary
experienced
as
she
sat
in
her
room

But
owing
to
the
superstition
that
the
fewer
the
people
who
know
of
it
the
less
a
woman
in
travail
suffers

everyone
tried
to
pretend
not
to
know

no
one
spoke
of
it

but
apart
from
the
ordinary
staid
and
respectful
good
manners
habitual
in
the
prince


s
household

a
common
anxiety

a
softening
of
the
heart

and
a
consciousness
that
something
great
and
mysterious
was
being
accomplished
at
that
moment
made
itself
felt


There
was
no
laughter
in
the
maids



large
hall

In
the
men
servants



hall
all
sat
waiting

silently
and
alert

In
the
outlying
serfs



quarters
torches
and
candles
were
burning
and
no
one
slept

The
old
prince

stepping
on
his
heels

paced
up
and
down
his
study
and
sent
T

khon
to
ask
Mary
Bogd

novna
what
news






Say
only
that



the
prince
told
me
to
ask




and
come
and
tell
me
her
answer








Inform
the
prince
that
labor
has
begun




said
Mary
Bogd

novna

giving
the
messenger
a
significant
look


T

khon
went
and
told
the
prince





Very
good




said
the
prince
closing
the
door
behind
him

and
T

khon
did
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
from
the
study
after
that


After
a
while
he
re
entered
it
as
if
to
snuff
the
candles

and

seeing
the
prince
was
lying
on
the
sofa

looked
at
him

noticed
his
perturbed
face

shook
his
head

and
going
up
to
him
silently
kissed
him
on
the
shoulder
and
left
the
room
without
snuffing
the
candles
or
saying
why
he
had
entered

The
most
solemn
mystery
in
the
world
continued
its
course

Evening
passed

night
came

and
the
feeling
of
suspense
and
softening
of
heart
in
the
presence
of
the
unfathomable
did
not
lessen
but
increased

No
one
slept


It
was
one
of
those
March
nights
when
winter
seems
to
wish
to
resume
its
sway
and
scatters
its
last
snows
and
storms
with
desperate
fury

A
relay
of
horses
had
been
sent
up
the
highroad
to
meet
the
German
doctor
from
Moscow
who
was
expected
every
moment

and
men
on
horseback
with
lanterns
were
sent
to
the
crossroads
to
guide
him
over
the
country
road
with
its
hollows
and
snow
covered
pools
of
water


Princess
Mary
had
long
since
put
aside
her
book

she
sat
silent

her
luminous
eyes
fixed
on
her
nurse


s
wrinkled
face

every
line
of
which
she
knew
so
well


on
the
lock
of
gray
hair
that
escaped
from
under
the
kerchief

and
the
loose
skin
that
hung
under
her
chin


Nurse
S

vishna

knitting
in
hand

was
telling
in
low
tones

scarcely
hearing
or
understanding
her
own
words

what
she
had
told
hundreds
of
times
before

how
the
late
princess
had
given
birth
to
Princess
Mary
in
Kishen

v
with
only
a
Moldavian
peasant
woman
to
help
instead
of
a
midwife





God
is
merciful

doctors
are
never
needed




she
said


Suddenly
a
gust
of
wind
beat
violently
against
the
casement
of
the
window

from
which
the
double
frame
had
been
removed

by
order
of
the
prince

one
window
frame
was
removed
in
each
room
as
soon
as
the
larks
returned


and

forcing
open
a
loosely
closed
latch

set
the
damask
curtain
flapping
and
blew
out
the
candle
with
its
chill

snowy
draft

Princess
Mary
shuddered

her
nurse

putting
down
the
stocking
she
was
knitting

went
to
the
window
and
leaning
out
tried
to
catch
the
open
casement

The
cold
wind
flapped
the
ends
of
her
kerchief
and
her
loose
locks
of
gray
hair





Princess

my
dear

there


s
someone
driving
up
the
avenue




she
said

holding
the
casement
and
not
closing
it




With
lanterns

Most
likely
the
doctor








Oh

my
God

thank
God




said
Princess
Mary




I
must
go
and
meet
him

he
does
not
know
Russian





Princess
Mary
threw
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
ran
to
meet
the
newcomer

As
she
was
crossing
the
anteroom
she
saw
through
the
window
a
carriage
with
lanterns

standing
at
the
entrance

She
went
out
on
the
stairs

On
a
banister
post
stood
a
tallow
candle
which
guttered
in
the
draft

On
the
landing
below

Philip

the
footman

stood
looking
scared
and
holding
another
candle

Still
lower

beyond
the
turn
of
the
staircase

one
could
hear
the
footstep
of
someone
in
thick
felt
boots

and
a
voice
that
seemed
familiar
to
Princess
Mary
was
saying
something





Thank
God




said
the
voice




And
Father








Gone
to
bed




replied
the
voice
of
Demy

n
the
house
steward

who
was
downstairs


Then
the
voice
said
something
more

Demy

n
replied

and
the
steps
in
the
felt
boots
approached
the
unseen
bend
of
the
staircase
more
rapidly





It


s
Andrew




thought
Princess
Mary




No
it
can


t
be

that
would
be
too
extraordinary




and
at
the
very
moment
she
thought
this

the
face
and
figure
of
Prince
Andrew

in
a
fur
cloak
the
deep
collar
of
which
covered
with
snow

appeared
on
the
landing
where
the
footman
stood
with
the
candle

Yes

it
was
he

pale

thin

with
a
changed
and
strangely
softened
but
agitated
expression
on
his
face

He
came
up
the
stairs
and
embraced
his
sister





You
did
not
get
my
letter




he
asked

and
not
waiting
for
a
reply


which
he
would
not
have
received

for
the
princess
was
unable
to
speak


he
turned
back

rapidly
mounted
the
stairs
again
with
the
doctor
who
had
entered
the
hall
after
him

they
had
met
at
the
last
post
station


and
again
embraced
his
sister





What
a
strange
fate

M

sha
darling




And
having
taken
off
his
cloak
and
felt
boots

he
went
to
the
little
princess



apartment






CHAPTER
IX

The
little
princess
lay
supported
by
pillows

with
a
white
cap
on
her
head

the
pains
had
just
left
her


Strands
of
her
black
hair
lay
round
her
inflamed
and
perspiring
cheeks

her
charming
rosy
mouth
with
its
downy
lip
was
open
and
she
was
smiling
joyfully

Prince
Andrew
entered
and
paused
facing
her
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
on
which
she
was
lying

Her
glittering
eyes

filled
with
childlike
fear
and
excitement

rested
on
him
without
changing
their
expression




I
love
you
all
and
have
done
no
harm
to
anyone

why
must
I
suffer
so

Help
me




her
look
seemed
to
say

She
saw
her
husband

but
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
his
appearance
before
her
now

Prince
Andrew
went
round
the
sofa
and
kissed
her
forehead





My
darling




he
said


a
word
he
had
never
used
to
her
before




God
is
merciful








She
looked
at
him
inquiringly
and
with
childlike
reproach





I
expected
help
from
you
and
I
get
none

none
from
you
either




said
her
eyes

She
was
not
surprised
at
his
having
come

she
did
not
realize
that
he
had
come

His
coming
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
sufferings
or
with
their
relief

The
pangs
began
again
and
Mary
Bogd

novna
advised
Prince
Andrew
to
leave
the
room


The
doctor
entered

Prince
Andrew
went
out
and

meeting
Princess
Mary

again
joined
her

They
began
talking
in
whispers

but
their
talk
broke
off
at
every
moment

They
waited
and
listened





Go

dear




said
Princess
Mary


Prince
Andrew
went
again
to
his
wife
and
sat
waiting
in
the
room
next
to
hers

A
woman
came
from
the
bedroom
with
a
frightened
face
and
became
confused
when
she
saw
Prince
Andrew

He
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
remained
so
for
some
minutes

Piteous

helpless

animal
moans
came
through
the
door

Prince
Andrew
got
up

went
to
the
door

and
tried
to
open
it

Someone
was
holding
it
shut





You
can


t
come
in

You
can


t




said
a
terrified
voice
from
within


He
began
pacing
the
room

The
screaming
ceased

and
a
few
more
seconds
went
by

Then
suddenly
a
terrible
shriek


it
could
not
be
hers

she
could
not
scream
like
that


came
from
the
bedroom

Prince
Andrew
ran
to
the
door

the
scream
ceased
and
he
heard
the
wail
of
an
infant





What
have
they
taken
a
baby
in
there
for




thought
Prince
Andrew
in
the
first
second




A
baby

What
baby




Why
is
there
a
baby
there

Or
is
the
baby
born





Then
suddenly
he
realized
the
joyful
significance
of
that
wail

tears
choked
him

and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
window
sill
he
began
to
cry

sobbing
like
a
child

The
door
opened

The
doctor
with
his
shirt
sleeves
tucked
up

without
a
coat

pale
and
with
a
trembling
jaw

came
out
of
the
room

Prince
Andrew
turned
to
him

but
the
doctor
gave
him
a
bewildered
look
and
passed
by
without
a
word

A
woman
rushed
out
and
seeing
Prince
Andrew
stopped

hesitating
on
the
threshold

He
went
into
his
wife


s
room

She
was
lying
dead

in
the
same
position
he
had
seen
her
in
five
minutes
before
and

despite
the
fixed
eyes
and
the
pallor
of
the
cheeks

the
same
expression
was
on
her
charming
childlike
face
with
its
upper
lip
covered
with
tiny
black
hair





I
love
you
all

and
have
done
no
harm
to
anyone

and
what
have
you
done
to
me






said
her
charming

pathetic

dead
face


In
a
corner
of
the
room
something
red
and
tiny
gave
a
grunt
and
squealed
in
Mary
Bogd

novna


s
trembling
white
hands



Two
hours
later
Prince
Andrew

stepping
softly

went
into
his
father


s
room

The
old
man
already
knew
everything

He
was
standing
close
to
the
door
and
as
soon
as
it
opened
his
rough
old
arms
closed
like
a
vise
round
his
son


s
neck

and
without
a
word
he
began
to
sob
like
a
child



Three
days
later
the
little
princess
was
buried

and
Prince
Andrew
went
up
the
steps
to
where
the
coffin
stood

to
give
her
the
farewell
kiss

And
there
in
the
coffin
was
the
same
face

though
with
closed
eyes




Ah

what
have
you
done
to
me




it
still
seemed
to
say

and
Prince
Andrew
felt
that
something
gave
way
in
his
soul
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
sin
he
could
neither
remedy
nor
forget

He
could
not
weep

The
old
man
too
came
up
and
kissed
the
waxen
little
hands
that
lay
quietly
crossed
one
on
the
other
on
her
breast

and
to
him

too

her
face
seemed
to
say




Ah

what
have
you
done
to
me

and
why




And
at
the
sight
the
old
man
turned
angrily
away



Another
five
days
passed

and
then
the
young
Prince
Nicholas
Andr

evich
was
baptized

The
wet
nurse
supported
the
coverlet
with
her
chin

while
the
priest
with
a
goose
feather
anointed
the
boy


s
little
red
and
wrinkled
soles
and
palms


His
grandfather

who
was
his
godfather

trembling
and
afraid
of
dropping
him

carried
the
infant
round
the
battered
tin
font
and
handed
him
over
to
the
godmother

Princess
Mary

Prince
Andrew
sat
in
another
room

faint
with
fear
lest
the
baby
should
be
drowned
in
the
font

and
awaited
the
termination
of
the
ceremony

He
looked
up
joyfully
at
the
baby
when
the
nurse
brought
it
to
him
and
nodded
approval
when
she
told
him
that
the
wax
with
the
baby


s
hair
had
not
sunk
in
the
font
but
had
floated






CHAPTER
X

Rost

v


s
share
in
D

lokhov


s
duel
with
Bez

khov
was
hushed
up
by
the
efforts
of
the
old
count

and
instead
of
being
degraded
to
the
ranks
as
he
expected
he
was
appointed
an
adjutant
to
the
governor
general
of
Moscow

As
a
result
he
could
not
go
to
the
country
with
the
rest
of
the
family

but
was
kept
all
summer
in
Moscow
by
his
new
duties

D

lokhov
recovered

and
Rost

v
became
very
friendly
with
him
during
his
convalescence

D

lokhov
lay
ill
at
his
mother


s
who
loved
him
passionately
and
tenderly

and
old
Mary
Iv

novna

who
had
grown
fond
of
Rost

v
for
his
friendship
to
her
F

dya

often
talked
to
him
about
her
son





Yes

Count




she
would
say




he
is
too
noble
and
pure
souled
for
our
present

depraved
world

No
one
now
loves
virtue

it
seems
like
a
reproach
to
everyone

Now
tell
me

Count

was
it
right

was
it
honorable

of
Bez

khov

And
F

dya

with
his
noble
spirit

loved
him
and
even
now
never
says
a
word
against
him

Those
pranks
in
Petersburg
when
they
played
some
tricks
on
a
policeman

didn


t
they
do
it
together

And
there

Bez

khov
got
off
scotfree

while
F

dya
had
to
bear
the
whole
burden
on
his
shoulders

Fancy
what
he
had
to
go
through

It


s
true
he
has
been
reinstated

but
how
could
they
fail
to
do
that

I
think
there
were
not
many
such
gallant
sons
of
the
fatherland
out
there
as
he

And
now


this
duel

Have
these
people
no
feeling

or
honor

Knowing
him
to
be
an
only
son

to
challenge
him
and
shoot
so
straight

It


s
well
God
had
mercy
on
us

And
what
was
it
for

Who
doesn


t
have
intrigues
nowadays

Why

if
he
was
so
jealous

as
I
see
things
he
should
have
shown
it
sooner

but
he
lets
it
go
on
for
months

And
then
to
call
him
out

reckoning
on
F

dya
not
fighting
because
he
owed
him
money

What
baseness

What
meanness

I
know
you
understand
F

dya

my
dear
count

that

believe
me

is
why
I
am
so
fond
of
you

Few
people
do
understand
him

He
is
such
a
lofty

heavenly
soul





D

lokhov
himself
during
his
convalescence
spoke
to
Rost

v
in
a
way
no
one
would
have
expected
of
him





I
know
people
consider
me
a
bad
man




he
said




Let
them

I
don


t
care
a
straw
about
anyone
but
those
I
love

but
those
I
love

I
love
so
that
I
would
give
my
life
for
them

and
the
others
I


d
throttle
if
they
stood
in
my
way

I
have
an
adored

a
priceless
mother

and
two
or
three
friends


you
among
them


and
as
for
the
rest
I
only
care
about
them
in
so
far
as
they
are
harmful
or
useful

And
most
of
them
are
harmful

especially
the
women

Yes

dear
boy




he
continued




I
have
met
loving

noble

high
minded
men

but
I
have
not
yet
met
any
women


countesses
or
cooks


who
were
not
venal

I
have
not
yet
met
that
divine
purity
and
devotion
I
look
for
in
women

If
I
found
such
a
one
I


d
give
my
life
for
her

But
those







and
he
made
a
gesture
of
contempt




And
believe
me

if
I
still
value
my
life
it
is
only
because
I
still
hope
to
meet
such
a
divine
creature

who
will
regenerate

purify

and
elevate
me

But
you
don


t
understand
it








Oh

yes

I
quite
understand




answered
Rost

v

who
was
under
his
new
friend


s
influence


In
the
autumn
the
Rost

vs
returned
to
Moscow

Early
in
the
winter
Den

sov
also
came
back
and
stayed
with
them

The
first
half
of
the
winter
of






which
Nicholas
Rost

v
spent
in
Moscow

was
one
of
the
happiest

merriest
times
for
him
and
the
whole
family

Nicholas
brought
many
young
men
to
his
parents



house

V

ra
was
a
handsome
girl
of
twenty

S

nya
a
girl
of
sixteen
with
all
the
charm
of
an
opening
flower

Nat

sha

half
grown
up
and
half
child

was
now
childishly
amusing

now
girlishly
enchanting


At
that
time
in
the
Rost

vs



house
there
prevailed
an
amorous
atmosphere
characteristic
of
homes
where
there
are
very
young
and
very
charming
girls

Every
young
man
who
came
to
the
house


seeing
those
impressionable

smiling
young
faces

smiling
probably
at
their
own
happiness


feeling
the
eager
bustle
around
him

and
hearing
the
fitful
bursts
of
song
and
music
and
the
inconsequent
but
friendly
prattle
of
young
girls
ready
for
anything
and
full
of
hope


experienced
the
same
feeling

sharing
with
the
young
folk
of
the
Rost

vs



household
a
readiness
to
fall
in
love
and
an
expectation
of
happiness


Among
the
young
men
introduced
by
Rost

v
one
of
the
first
was
D

lokhov

whom
everyone
in
the
house
liked
except
Nat

sha

She
almost
quarreled
with
her
brother
about
him

She
insisted
that
he
was
a
bad
man

and
that
in
the
duel
with
Bez

khov

Pierre
was
right
and
D

lokhov
wrong

and
further
that
he
was
disagreeable
and
unnatural





There


s
nothing
for
me
to
understand




she
cried
out
with
resolute
self
will




he
is
wicked
and
heartless

There
now

I
like
your
Den

sov
though
he
is
a
rake
and
all
that

still
I
like
him

so
you
see
I
do
understand

I
don


t
know
how
to
put
it



with
this
one
everything
is
calculated

and
I
don


t
like
that

But
Den

sov










Oh

Den

sov
is
quite
different




replied
Nicholas

implying
that
even
Den

sov
was
nothing
compared
to
D

lokhov





you
must
understand
what
a
soul
there
is
in
D

lokhov

you
should
see
him
with
his
mother

What
a
heart








Well

I
don


t
know
about
that

but
I
am
uncomfortable
with
him

And
do
you
know
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
S

nya








What
nonsense










I


m
certain
of
it

you


ll
see





Nat

sha


s
prediction
proved
true

D

lokhov

who
did
not
usually
care
for
the
society
of
ladies

began
to
come
often
to
the
house

and
the
question
for
whose
sake
he
came

though
no
one
spoke
of
it

was
soon
settled

He
came
because
of
S

nya

And
S

nya

though
she
would
never
have
dared
to
say
so

knew
it
and
blushed
scarlet
every
time
D

lokhov
appeared


D

lokhov
often
dined
at
the
Rost

vs




never
missed
a
performance
at
which
they
were
present

and
went
to
Iogel


s
balls
for
young
people
which
the
Rost

vs
always
attended

He
was
pointedly
attentive
to
S

nya
and
looked
at
her
in
such
a
way
that
not
only
could
she
not
bear
his
glances
without
coloring

but
even
the
old
countess
and
Nat

sha
blushed
when
they
saw
his
looks


It
was
evident
that
this
strange

strong
man
was
under
the
irresistible
influence
of
the
dark

graceful
girl
who
loved
another


Rost

v
noticed
something
new
in
D

lokhov


s
relations
with
S

nya

but
he
did
not
explain
to
himself
what
these
new
relations
were




They


re
always
in
love
with
someone




he
thought
of
S

nya
and
Nat

sha

But
he
was
not
as
much
at
ease
with
S

nya
and
D

lokhov
as
before
and
was
less
frequently
at
home


In
the
autumn
of





everybody
had
again
begun
talking
of
the
war
with
Napoleon
with
even
greater
warmth
than
the
year
before

Orders
were
given
to
raise
recruits

ten
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
regular
army

and
besides
this

nine
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
militia

Everywhere
Bonaparte
was
anathematized
and
in
Moscow
nothing
but
the
coming
war
was
talked
of

For
the
Rost

v
family
the
whole
interest
of
these
preparations
for
war
lay
in
the
fact
that
Nicholas
would
not
hear
of
remaining
in
Moscow

and
only
awaited
the
termination
of
Den

sov


s
furlough
after
Christmas
to
return
with
him
to
their
regiment

His
approaching
departure
did
not
prevent
his
amusing
himself

but
rather
gave
zest
to
his
pleasures

He
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
away
from
home

at
dinners

parties

and
balls






CHAPTER
XI

On
the
third
day
after
Christmas
Nicholas
dined
at
home

a
thing
he
had
rarely
done
of
late

It
was
a
grand
farewell
dinner

as
he
and
Den

sov
were
leaving
to
join
their
regiment
after
Epiphany

About
twenty
people
were
present

including
D

lokhov
and
Den

sov


Never
had
love
been
so
much
in
the
air

and
never
had
the
amorous
atmosphere
made
itself
so
strongly
felt
in
the
Rost

vs



house
as
at
this
holiday
time




Seize
the
moments
of
happiness

love
and
be
loved

That
is
the
only
reality
in
the
world

all
else
is
folly

It
is
the
one
thing
we
are
interested
in
here




said
the
spirit
of
the
place


Nicholas

having
as
usual
exhausted
two
pairs
of
horses

without
visiting
all
the
places
he
meant
to
go
to
and
where
he
had
been
invited

returned
home
just
before
dinner

As
soon
as
he
entered
he
noticed
and
felt
the
tension
of
the
amorous
air
in
the
house

and
also
noticed
a
curious
embarrassment
among
some
of
those
present

S

nya

D

lokhov

and
the
old
countess
were
especially
disturbed

and
to
a
lesser
degree
Nat

sha

Nicholas
understood
that
something
must
have
happened
between
S

nya
and
D

lokhov
before
dinner

and
with
the
kindly
sensitiveness
natural
to
him
was
very
gentle
and
wary
with
them
both
at
dinner

On
that
same
evening
there
was
to
be
one
of
the
balls
that
Iogel

the
dancing
master

gave
for
his
pupils
during
the
holidays





Nicholas

will
you
come
to
Iogel


s

Please
do




said
Nat

sha




He
asked
you

and
Vas

li
Dm

trich


is
also
going











Den

sov





Where
would
I
not
go
at
the
countess



command




said
Den

sov

who
at
the
Rost

vs



had
jocularly
assumed
the
role
of
Nat

sha


s
knight




I


m
even
weady
to
dance
the
pas
de
ch

le








If
I
have
time




answered
Nicholas




But
I
promised
the
Arkh

rovs

they
have
a
party








And
you




he
asked
D

lokhov

but
as
soon
as
he
had
asked
the
question
he
noticed
that
it
should
not
have
been
put





Perhaps




coldly
and
angrily
replied
D

lokhov

glancing
at
S

nya

and

scowling

he
gave
Nicholas
just
such
a
look
as
he
had
given
Pierre
at
the
club
dinner





There
is
something
up




thought
Nicholas

and
he
was
further
confirmed
in
this
conclusion
by
the
fact
that
D

lokhov
left
immediately
after
dinner

He
called
Nat

sha
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter





And
I
was
looking
for
you




said
Nat

sha
running
out
to
him




I
told
you

but
you
would
not
believe
it




she
said
triumphantly




He
has
proposed
to
S

nya





Little
as
Nicholas
had
occupied
himself
with
S

nya
of
late

something
seemed
to
give
way
within
him
at
this
news

D

lokhov
was
a
suitable
and
in
some
respects
a
brilliant
match
for
the
dowerless

orphan
girl

From
the
point
of
view
of
the
old
countess
and
of
society
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
her
to
refuse
him

And
therefore
Nicholas



first
feeling
on
hearing
the
news
was
one
of
anger
with
S

nya




He
tried
to
say




That


s
capital

of
course
she


ll
forget
her
childish
promises
and
accept
the
offer




but
before
he
had
time
to
say
it
Nat

sha
began
again





And
fancy

she
refused
him
quite
definitely




adding

after
a
pause




she
told
him
she
loved
another








Yes

my
S

nya
could
not
have
done
otherwise




thought
Nicholas





Much
as
Mamma
pressed
her

she
refused

and
I
know
she
won


t
change
once
she
has
said










And
Mamma
pressed
her




said
Nicholas
reproachfully





Yes




said
Nat

sha




Do
you
know

Nicholas


don


t
be
angry


but
I
know
you
will
not
marry
her

I
know

heaven
knows
how

but
I
know
for
certain
that
you
won


t
marry
her








Now
you
don


t
know
that
at
all




said
Nicholas




But
I
must
talk
to
her

What
a
darling
S

nya
is




he
added
with
a
smile





Ah

she
is
indeed
a
darling

I


ll
send
her
to
you





And
Nat

sha
kissed
her
brother
and
ran
away


A
minute
later
S

nya
came
in
with
a
frightened

guilty

and
scared
look

Nicholas
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
hand

This
was
the
first
time
since
his
return
that
they
had
talked
alone
and
about
their
love





Sophie




he
began

timidly
at
first
and
then
more
and
more
boldly




if
you
wish
to
refuse
one
who
is
not
only
a
brilliant
and
advantageous
match
but
a
splendid

noble
fellow



he
is
my
friend







S

nya
interrupted
him





I
have
already
refused




she
said
hurriedly





If
you
are
refusing
for
my
sake

I
am
afraid
that
I







S

nya
again
interrupted

She
gave
him
an
imploring

frightened
look





Nicholas

don


t
tell
me
that




she
said





No

but
I
must

It
may
be
arrogant
of
me

but
still
it
is
best
to
say
it

If
you
refuse
him
on
my
account

I
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth

I
love
you

and
I
think
I
love
you
more
than
anyone
else











That
is
enough
for
me




said
S

nya

blushing





No

but
I
have
been
in
love
a
thousand
times
and
shall
fall
in
love
again

though
for
no
one
have
I
such
a
feeling
of
friendship

confidence

and
love
as
I
have
for
you

Then
I
am
young

Mamma
does
not
wish
it

In
a
word

I
make
no
promise

And
I
beg
you
to
consider
D

lokhov


s
offer




he
said

articulating
his
friend


s
name
with
difficulty





Don


t
say
that
to
me

I
want
nothing

I
love
you
as
a
brother
and
always
shall

and
I
want
nothing
more








You
are
an
angel

I
am
not
worthy
of
you

but
I
am
afraid
of
misleading
you





And
Nicholas
again
kissed
her
hand






CHAPTER
XII

Iogel


s
were
the
most
enjoyable
balls
in
Moscow

So
said
the
mothers
as
they
watched
their
young
people
executing
their
newly
learned
steps

and
so
said
the
youths
and
maidens
themselves
as
they
danced
till
they
were
ready
to
drop

and
so
said
the
grown
up
young
men
and
women
who
came
to
these
balls
with
an
air
of
condescension
and
found
them
most
enjoyable

That
year
two
marriages
had
come
of
these
balls

The
two
pretty
young
Princesses
Gorchak

v
met
suitors
there
and
were
married
and
so
further
increased
the
fame
of
these
dances

What
distinguished
them
from
others
was
the
absence
of
host
or
hostess
and
the
presence
of
the
good
natured
Iogel

flying
about
like
a
feather
and
bowing
according
to
the
rules
of
his
art

as
he
collected
the
tickets
from
all
his
visitors

There
was
the
fact
that
only
those
came
who
wished
to
dance
and
amuse
themselves
as
girls
of
thirteen
and
fourteen
do
who
are
wearing
long
dresses
for
the
first
time

With
scarcely
any
exceptions
they
all
were

or
seemed
to
be

pretty


so
rapturous
were
their
smiles
and
so
sparkling
their
eyes

Sometimes
the
best
of
the
pupils

of
whom
Nat

sha

who
was
exceptionally
graceful

was
first

even
danced
the
pas
de
ch

le

but
at
this
last
ball
only
the


cossaise

the
anglaise

and
the
mazurka

which
was
just
coming
into
fashion

were
danced

Iogel
had
taken
a
ballroom
in
Bez

khov


s
house

and
the
ball

as
everyone
said

was
a
great
success

There
were
many
pretty
girls
and
the
Rost

v
girls
were
among
the
prettiest

They
were
both
particularly
happy
and
gay

That
evening

proud
of
D

lokhov


s
proposal

her
refusal

and
her
explanation
with
Nicholas

S

nya
twirled
about
before
she
left
home
so
that
the
maid
could
hardly
get
her
hair
plaited

and
she
was
transparently
radiant
with
impulsive
joy


Nat

sha
no
less
proud
of
her
first
long
dress
and
of
being
at
a
real
ball
was
even
happier

They
were
both
dressed
in
white
muslin
with
pink
ribbons


Nat

sha
fell
in
love
the
very
moment
she
entered
the
ballroom

She
was
not
in
love
with
anyone
in
particular

but
with
everyone

Whatever
person
she
happened
to
look
at
she
was
in
love
with
for
that
moment





Oh

how
delightful
it
is




she
kept
saying

running
up
to
S

nya


Nicholas
and
Den

sov
were
walking
up
and
down

looking
with
kindly
patronage
at
the
dancers





How
sweet
she
is


she
will
be
a
weal
beauty




said
Den

sov





Who








Countess
Nat

sha




answered
Den

sov





And
how
she
dances

What
gwace




he
said
again
after
a
pause





Who
are
you
talking
about








About
your
sister




ejaculated
Den

sov
testily


Rost

v
smiled





My
dear
count

you
were
one
of
my
best
pupils


you
must
dance




said
little
Iogel
coming
up
to
Nicholas




Look
how
many
charming
young
ladies






He
turned
with
the
same
request
to
Den

sov
who
was
also
a
former
pupil
of
his





No

my
dear
fellow

I


ll
be
a
wallflower




said
Den

sov




Don


t
you
wecollect
what
bad
use
I
made
of
your
lessons








Oh
no




said
Iogel

hastening
to
reassure
him




You
were
only
inattentive

but
you
had
talent


oh
yes

you
had
talent





The
band
struck
up
the
newly
introduced
mazurka

Nicholas
could
not
refuse
Iogel
and
asked
S

nya
to
dance

Den

sov
sat
down
by
the
old
ladies
and

leaning
on
his
saber
and
beating
time
with
his
foot

told
them
something
funny
and
kept
them
amused

while
he
watched
the
young
people
dancing

Iogel
with
Nat

sha

his
pride
and
his
best
pupil

were
the
first
couple

Noiselessly

skillfully
stepping
with
his
little
feet
in
low
shoes

Iogel
flew
first
across
the
hall
with
Nat

sha

who

though
shy

went
on
carefully
executing
her
steps

Den

sov
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
and
beat
time
with
his
saber
in
a
way
that
clearly
indicated
that
if
he
was
not
dancing
it
was
because
he
would
not
and
not
because
he
could
not

In
the
middle
of
a
figure
he
beckoned
to
Rost

v
who
was
passing





This
is
not
at
all
the
thing




he
said




What
sort
of
Polish
mazuwka
is
this

But
she
does
dance
splendidly





Knowing
that
Den

sov
had
a
reputation
even
in
Poland
for
the
masterly
way
in
which
he
danced
the
mazurka

Nicholas
ran
up
to
Nat

sha





Go
and
choose
Den

sov

He
is
a
real
dancer

a
wonder




he
said


When
it
came
to
Nat

sha


s
turn
to
choose
a
partner

she
rose
and

tripping
rapidly
across
in
her
little
shoes
trimmed
with
bows

ran
timidly
to
the
corner
where
Den

sov
sat

She
saw
that
everybody
was
looking
at
her
and
waiting

Nicholas
saw
that
Den

sov
was
refusing
though
he
smiled
delightedly

He
ran
up
to
them





Please

Vas

li
Dm

trich




Nat

sha
was
saying




do
come








Oh
no

let
me
off

Countess




Den

sov
replied





Now
then

V

ska




said
Nicholas





They
coax
me
as
if
I
were
V

ska
the
cat




said
Den

sov
jokingly





I


ll
sing
for
you
a
whole
evening




said
Nat

sha





Oh

the
faiwy

She
can
do
anything
with
me




said
Den

sov

and
he
unhooked
his
saber

He
came
out
from
behind
the
chairs

clasped
his
partner


s
hand
firmly

threw
back
his
head

and
advanced
his
foot

waiting
for
the
beat

Only
on
horse
back
and
in
the
mazurka
was
Den

sov


s
short
stature
not
noticeable
and
he
looked
the
fine
fellow
he
felt
himself
to
be

At
the
right
beat
of
the
music
he
looked
sideways
at
his
partner
with
a
merry
and
triumphant
air

suddenly
stamped
with
one
foot

bounded
from
the
floor
like
a
ball

and
flew
round
the
room
taking
his
partner
with
him

He
glided
silently
on
one
foot
half
across
the
room

and
seeming
not
to
notice
the
chairs
was
dashing
straight
at
them

when
suddenly

clinking
his
spurs
and
spreading
out
his
legs

he
stopped
short
on
his
heels

stood
so
a
second

stamped
on
the
spot
clanking
his
spurs

whirled
rapidly
round

and

striking
his
left
heel
against
his
right

flew
round
again
in
a
circle

Nat

sha
guessed
what
he
meant
to
do

and
abandoning
herself
to
him
followed
his
lead
hardly
knowing
how

First
he
spun
her
round

holding
her
now
with
his
left

now
with
his
right
hand

then
falling
on
one
knee
he
twirled
her
round
him

and
again
jumping
up

dashed
so
impetuously
forward
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
rush
through
the
whole
suite
of
rooms
without
drawing
breath

and
then
he
suddenly
stopped
and
performed
some
new
and
unexpected
steps

When
at
last

smartly
whirling
his
partner
round
in
front
of
her
chair

he
drew
up
with
a
click
of
his
spurs
and
bowed
to
her

Nat

sha
did
not
even
make
him
a
curtsy

She
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
in
amazement

smiling
as
if
she
did
not
recognize
him





What
does
this
mean




she
brought
out


Although
Iogel
did
not
acknowledge
this
to
be
the
real
mazurka

everyone
was
delighted
with
Den

sov


s
skill

he
was
asked
again
and
again
as
a
partner

and
the
old
men
began
smilingly
to
talk
about
Poland
and
the
good
old
days

Den

sov

flushed
after
the
mazurka
and
mopping
himself
with
his
handkerchief

sat
down
by
Nat

sha
and
did
not
leave
her
for
the
rest
of
the
evening






CHAPTER
XIII

For
two
days
after
that
Rost

v
did
not
see
D

lokhov
at
his
own
or
at
D

lokhov


s
home

on
the
third
day
he
received
a
note
from
him


As
I
do
not
intend
to
be
at
your
house
again
for
reasons
you
know
of

and
am
going
to
rejoin
my
regiment

I
am
giving
a
farewell
supper
tonight
to
my
friends


come
to
the
English
Hotel


About
ten
o


clock
Rost

v
went
to
the
English
Hotel
straight
from
the
theater

where
he
had
been
with
his
family
and
Den

sov

He
was
at
once
shown
to
the
best
room

which
D

lokhov
had
taken
for
that
evening

Some
twenty
men
were
gathered
round
a
table
at
which
D

lokhov
sat
between
two
candles

On
the
table
was
a
pile
of
gold
and
paper
money

and
he
was
keeping
the
bank

Rost

v
had
not
seen
him
since
his
proposal
and
S

nya


s
refusal
and
felt
uncomfortable
at
the
thought
of
how
they
would
meet


D

lokhov


s
clear

cold
glance
met
Rost

v
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
door

as
though
he
had
long
expected
him





It


s
a
long
time
since
we
met




he
said




Thanks
for
coming

I


ll
just
finish
dealing

and
then
Ily

shka
will
come
with
his
chorus








I
called
once
or
twice
at
your
house




said
Rost

v

reddening


D

lokhov
made
no
reply





You
may
punt




he
said


Rost

v
recalled
at
that
moment
a
strange
conversation
he
had
once
had
with
D

lokhov




None
but
fools
trust
to
luck
in
play




D

lokhov
had
then
said





Or
are
you
afraid
to
play
with
me




D

lokhov
now
asked
as
if
guessing
Rost

v


s
thought


Beneath
his
smile
Rost

v
saw
in
him
the
mood
he
had
shown
at
the
club
dinner
and
at
other
times

when
as
if
tired
of
everyday
life
he
had
felt
a
need
to
escape
from
it
by
some
strange

and
usually
cruel

action


Rost

v
felt
ill
at
ease

He
tried

but
failed

to
find
some
joke
with
which
to
reply
to
D

lokhov


s
words

But
before
he
had
thought
of
anything

D

lokhov

looking
straight
in
his
face

said
slowly
and
deliberately
so
that
everyone
could
hear





Do
you
remember
we
had
a
talk
about
cards






He


s
a
fool
who
trusts
to
luck

one
should
make
certain




and
I
want
to
try








To
try
his
luck
or
the
certainty




Rost

v
asked
himself





Well

you


d
better
not
play




D

lokhov
added

and
springing
a
new
pack
of
cards
said




Bank

gentlemen





Moving
the
money
forward
he
prepared
to
deal

Rost

v
sat
down
by
his
side
and
at
first
did
not
play

D

lokhov
kept
glancing
at
him





Why
don


t
you
play




he
asked


And
strange
to
say
Nicholas
felt
that
he
could
not
help
taking
up
a
card

putting
a
small
stake
on
it

and
beginning
to
play





I
have
no
money
with
me




he
said





I


ll
trust
you





Rost

v
staked
five
rubles
on
a
card
and
lost

staked
again

and
again
lost

D

lokhov



killed




that
is

beat

ten
cards
of
Rost

v


s
running





Gentlemen




said
D

lokhov
after
he
had
dealt
for
some
time




Please
place
your
money
on
the
cards
or
I
may
get
muddled
in
the
reckoning





One
of
the
players
said
he
hoped
he
might
be
trusted





Yes

you
might

but
I
am
afraid
of
getting
the
accounts
mixed

So
I
ask
you
to
put
the
money
on
your
cards




replied
D

lokhov




Don


t
stint
yourself

we


ll
settle
afterwards




he
added

turning
to
Rost

v


The
game
continued

a
waiter
kept
handing
round
champagne


All
Rost

v


s
cards
were
beaten
and
he
had
eight
hundred
rubles
scored
up
against
him

He
wrote







rubles



on
a
card

but
while
the
waiter
filled
his
glass
he
changed
his
mind
and
altered
it
to
his
usual
stake
of
twenty
rubles





Leave
it




said
D

lokhov

though
he
did
not
seem
to
be
even
looking
at
Rost

v




you


ll
win
it
back
all
the
sooner

I
lose
to
the
others
but
win
from
you

Or
are
you
afraid
of
me




he
asked
again


Rost

v
submitted

He
let
the
eight
hundred
remain
and
laid
down
a
seven
of
hearts
with
a
torn
corner

which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
floor

He
well
remembered
that
seven
afterwards

He
laid
down
the
seven
of
hearts

on
which
with
a
broken
bit
of
chalk
he
had
written







rubles



in
clear
upright
figures

he
emptied
the
glass
of
warm
champagne
that
was
handed
him

smiled
at
D

lokhov


s
words

and
with
a
sinking
heart

waiting
for
a
seven
to
turn
up

gazed
at
D

lokhov


s
hands
which
held
the
pack

Much
depended
on
Rost

v


s
winning
or
losing
on
that
seven
of
hearts

On
the
previous
Sunday
the
old
count
had
given
his
son
two
thousand
rubles

and
though
he
always
disliked
speaking
of
money
difficulties
had
told
Nicholas
that
this
was
all
he
could
let
him
have
till
May

and
asked
him
to
be
more
economical
this
time

Nicholas
had
replied
that
it
would
be
more
than
enough
for
him
and
that
he
gave
his
word
of
honor
not
to
take
anything
more
till
the
spring

Now
only
twelve
hundred
rubles
was
left
of
that
money

so
that
this
seven
of
hearts
meant
for
him
not
only
the
loss
of
sixteen
hundred
rubles

but
the
necessity
of
going
back
on
his
word

With
a
sinking
heart
he
watched
D

lokhov


s
hands
and
thought




Now
then

make
haste
and
let
me
have
this
card
and
I


ll
take
my
cap
and
drive
home
to
supper
with
Den

sov

Nat

sha

and
S

nya

and
will
certainly
never
touch
a
card
again




At
that
moment
his
home
life

jokes
with
P

tya

talks
with
S

nya

duets
with
Nat

sha

piquet
with
his
father

and
even
his
comfortable
bed
in
the
house
on
the
Povarsk

ya
rose
before
him
with
such
vividness

clearness

and
charm
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
all
a
lost
and
unappreciated
bliss

long
past

He
could
not
conceive
that
a
stupid
chance

letting
the
seven
be
dealt
to
the
right
rather
than
to
the
left

might
deprive
him
of
all
this
happiness

newly
appreciated
and
newly
illumined

and
plunge
him
into
the
depths
of
unknown
and
undefined
misery

That
could
not
be

yet
he
awaited
with
a
sinking
heart
the
movement
of
D

lokhov


s
hands

Those
broad

reddish
hands

with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
cuffs

laid
down
the
pack
and
took
up
a
glass
and
a
pipe
that
were
handed
him





So
you
are
not
afraid
to
play
with
me




repeated
D

lokhov

and
as
if
about
to
tell
a
good
story
he
put
down
the
cards

leaned
back
in
his
chair

and
began
deliberately
with
a
smile





Yes

gentlemen

I


ve
been
told
there


s
a
rumor
going
about
Moscow
that
I


m
a
sharper

so
I
advise
you
to
be
careful








Come
now

deal




exclaimed
Rost

v





Oh

those
Moscow
gossips




said
D

lokhov

and
he
took
up
the
cards
with
a
smile





Aah




Rost

v
almost
screamed
lifting
both
hands
to
his
head

The
seven
he
needed
was
lying
uppermost

the
first
card
in
the
pack

He
had
lost
more
than
he
could
pay





Still

don


t
ruin
yourself




said
D

lokhov
with
a
side
glance
at
Rost

v
as
he
continued
to
deal






CHAPTER
XIV

An
hour
and
a
half
later
most
of
the
players
were
but
little
interested
in
their
own
play


The
whole
interest
was
concentrated
on
Rost

v

Instead
of
sixteen
hundred
rubles
he
had
a
long
column
of
figures
scored
against
him

which
he
had
reckoned
up
to
ten
thousand

but
that
now

as
he
vaguely
supposed

must
have
risen
to
fifteen
thousand

In
reality
it
already
exceeded
twenty
thousand
rubles

D

lokhov
was
no
longer
listening
to
stories
or
telling
them

but
followed
every
movement
of
Rost

v


s
hands
and
occasionally
ran
his
eyes
over
the
score
against
him

He
had
decided
to
play
until
that
score
reached
forty
three
thousand

He
had
fixed
on
that
number
because
forty
three
was
the
sum
of
his
and
S

nya


s
joint
ages

Rost

v

leaning
his
head
on
both
hands

sat
at
the
table
which
was
scrawled
over
with
figures

wet
with
spilled
wine

and
littered
with
cards

One
tormenting
impression
did
not
leave
him

that
those
broad
boned
reddish
hands
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
sleeves

those
hands
which
he
loved
and
hated

held
him
in
their
power





Six
hundred
rubles

ace

a
corner

a
nine



winning
it
back


s
impossible



Oh

how
pleasant
it
was
at
home




The
knave

double
or
quits



it
can


t
be




And
why
is
he
doing
this
to
me




Rost

v
pondered

Sometimes
he
staked
a
large
sum

but
D

lokhov
refused
to
accept
it
and
fixed
the
stake
himself

Nicholas
submitted
to
him

and
at
one
moment
prayed
to
God
as
he
had
done
on
the
battlefield
at
the
bridge
over
the
Enns

and
then
guessed
that
the
card
that
came
first
to
hand
from
the
crumpled
heap
under
the
table
would
save
him

now
counted
the
cords
on
his
coat
and
took
a
card
with
that
number
and
tried
staking
the
total
of
his
losses
on
it

then
he
looked
round
for
aid
from
the
other
players

or
peered
at
the
now
cold
face
of
D

lokhov
and
tried
to
read
what
was
passing
in
his
mind





He
knows
of
course
what
this
loss
means
to
me

He
can


t
want
my
ruin

Wasn


t
he
my
friend

Wasn


t
I
fond
of
him

But
it


s
not
his
fault

What


s
he
to
do
if
he
has
such
luck




And
it


s
not
my
fault
either




he
thought
to
himself




I
have
done
nothing
wrong

Have
I
killed
anyone

or
insulted
or
wished
harm
to
anyone

Why
such
a
terrible
misfortune

And
when
did
it
begin

Such
a
little
while
ago
I
came
to
this
table
with
the
thought
of
winning
a
hundred
rubles
to
buy
that
casket
for
Mamma


s
name
day
and
then
going
home

I
was
so
happy

so
free

so
lighthearted

And
I
did
not
realize
how
happy
I
was

When
did
that
end
and
when
did
this
new

terrible
state
of
things
begin

What
marked
the
change

I
sat
all
the
time
in
this
same
place
at
this
table

chose
and
placed
cards

and
watched
those
broad
boned
agile
hands
in
the
same
way

When
did
it
happen
and
what
has
happened

I
am
well
and
strong
and
still
the
same
and
in
the
same
place

No

it
can


t
be

Surely
it
will
all
end
in
nothing





He
was
flushed
and
bathed
in
perspiration

though
the
room
was
not
hot

His
face
was
terrible
and
piteous
to
see

especially
from
its
helpless
efforts
to
seem
calm


The
score
against
him
reached
the
fateful
sum
of
forty
three
thousand

Rost

v
had
just
prepared
a
card

by
bending
the
corner
of
which
he
meant
to
double
the
three
thousand
just
put
down
to
his
score

when
D

lokhov

slamming
down
the
pack
of
cards

put
it
aside
and
began
rapidly
adding
up
the
total
of
Rost

v


s
debt

breaking
the
chalk
as
he
marked
the
figures
in
his
clear

bold
hand





Supper

it


s
time
for
supper

And
here
are
the
gypsies





Some
swarthy
men
and
women
were
really
entering
from
the
cold
outside
and
saying
something
in
their
gypsy
accents

Nicholas
understood
that
it
was
all
over

but
he
said
in
an
indifferent
tone





Well

won


t
you
go
on

I
had
a
splendid
card
all
ready




as
if
it
were
the
fun
of
the
game
which
interested
him
most





It


s
all
up

I


m
lost




thought
he




Now
a
bullet
through
my
brain


that


s
all
that


s
left
me




And
at
the
same
time
he
said
in
a
cheerful
voice





Come
now

just
this
one
more
little
card








All
right




said
D

lokhov

having
finished
the
addition




All
right

Twenty
one
rubles




he
said

pointing
to
the
figure
twenty
one
by
which
the
total
exceeded
the
round
sum
of
forty
three
thousand

and
taking
up
a
pack
he
prepared
to
deal

Rost

v
submissively
unbent
the
corner
of
his
card
and

instead
of
the
six
thousand
he
had
intended

carefully
wrote
twenty
one





It


s
all
the
same
to
me




he
said




I
only
want
to
see
whether
you
will
let
me
win
this
ten

or
beat
it





D

lokhov
began
to
deal
seriously

Oh

how
Rost

v
detested
at
that
moment
those
hands
with
their
short
reddish
fingers
and
hairy
wrists

which
held
him
in
their
power




The
ten
fell
to
him





You
owe
forty
three
thousand

Count




said
D

lokhov

and
stretching
himself
he
rose
from
the
table




One
does
get
tired
sitting
so
long




he
added





Yes

I


m
tired
too




said
Rost

v


D

lokhov
cut
him
short

as
if
to
remind
him
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
jest





When
am
I
to
receive
the
money

Count





Rost

v

flushing

drew
D

lokhov
into
the
next
room





I
cannot
pay
it
all
immediately

Will
you
take
an
I
O
U





he
said





I
say

Rost

v




said
D

lokhov
clearly

smiling
and
looking
Nicholas
straight
in
the
eyes




you
know
the
saying




Lucky
in
love

unlucky
at
cards




Your
cousin
is
in
love
with
you

I
know








Oh

it


s
terrible
to
feel
oneself
so
in
this
man


s
power




thought
Rost

v

He
knew
what
a
shock
he
would
inflict
on
his
father
and
mother
by
the
news
of
this
loss

he
knew
what
a
relief
it
would
be
to
escape
it
all

and
felt
that
D

lokhov
knew
that
he
could
save
him
from
all
this
shame
and
sorrow

but
wanted
now
to
play
with
him
as
a
cat
does
with
a
mouse





Your
cousin






D

lokhov
started
to
say

but
Nicholas
interrupted
him





My
cousin
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
and
it


s
not
necessary
to
mention
her




he
exclaimed
fiercely





Then
when
am
I
to
have
it








Tomorrow




replied
Rost

v
and
left
the
room






CHAPTER
XV

To
say



tomorrow



and
keep
up
a
dignified
tone
was
not
difficult

but
to
go
home
alone

see
his
sisters

brother

mother

and
father

confess
and
ask
for
money
he
had
no
right
to
after
giving
his
word
of
honor

was
terrible


At
home

they
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed

The
young
people

after
returning
from
the
theater

had
had
supper
and
were
grouped
round
the
clavichord

As
soon
as
Nicholas
entered

he
was
enfolded
in
that
poetic
atmosphere
of
love
which
pervaded
the
Rost

v
household
that
winter
and

now
after
D

lokhov


s
proposal
and
Iogel


s
ball

seemed
to
have
grown
thicker
round
S

nya
and
Nat

sha
as
the
air
does
before
a
thunderstorm

S

nya
and
Nat

sha

in
the
light
blue
dresses
they
had
worn
at
the
theater

looking
pretty
and
conscious
of
it

were
standing
by
the
clavichord

happy
and
smiling

V

ra
was
playing
chess
with
Shinsh

n
in
the
drawing
room

The
old
countess

waiting
for
the
return
of
her
husband
and
son

sat
playing
patience
with
the
old
gentlewoman
who
lived
in
their
house

Den

sov

with
sparkling
eyes
and
ruffled
hair

sat
at
the
clavichord
striking
chords
with
his
short
fingers

his
legs
thrown
back
and
his
eyes
rolling
as
he
sang

with
his
small

husky

but
true
voice

some
verses
called



Enchantress




which
he
had
composed

and
to
which
he
was
trying
to
fit
music





Enchantress

say

to
my
forsaken
lyre



What
magic
power
is
this
recalls
me
still




What
spark
has
set
my
inmost
soul
on
fire




What
is
this
bliss
that
makes
my
fingers
thrill


He
was
singing
in
passionate
tones

gazing
with
his
sparkling
black
agate
eyes
at
the
frightened
and
happy
Nat

sha





Splendid

Excellent




exclaimed
Nat

sha




Another
verse




she
said

without
noticing
Nicholas





Everything


s
still
the
same
with
them




thought
Nicholas

glancing
into
the
drawing
room

where
he
saw
V

ra
and
his
mother
with
the
old
lady





Ah

and
here


s
Nicholas




cried
Nat

sha

running
up
to
him





Is
Papa
at
home




he
asked





I
am
so
glad
you


ve
come




said
Nat

sha

without
answering
him




We
are
enjoying
ourselves

Vas

li
Dm

trich
is
staying
a
day
longer
for
my
sake

Did
you
know








No

Papa
is
not
back
yet




said
S

nya





Nicholas

have
you
come

Come
here

dear




called
the
old
countess
from
the
drawing
room


Nicholas
went
to
her

kissed
her
hand

and
sitting
down
silently
at
her
table
began
to
watch
her
hands
arranging
the
cards

From
the
dancing
room

they
still
heard
the
laughter
and
merry
voices
trying
to
persuade
Nat

sha
to
sing





All
wight

All
wight




shouted
Den

sov




It


s
no
good
making
excuses
now

It


s
your
turn
to
sing
the
ba


cawolla


I
entweat
you





The
countess
glanced
at
her
silent
son





What
is
the
matter




she
asked





Oh

nothing




said
he

as
if
weary
of
being
continually
asked
the
same
question




Will
Papa
be
back
soon








I
expect
so








Everything


s
the
same
with
them

They
know
nothing
about
it

Where
am
I
to
go




thought
Nicholas

and
went
again
into
the
dancing
room
where
the
clavichord
stood


S

nya
was
sitting
at
the
clavichord

playing
the
prelude
to
Den

sov


s
favorite
barcarolle

Nat

sha
was
preparing
to
sing

Den

sov
was
looking
at
her
with
enraptured
eyes


Nicholas
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room





Why
do
they
want
to
make
her
sing

How
can
she
sing

There


s
nothing
to
be
happy
about




thought
he


S

nya
struck
the
first
chord
of
the
prelude





My
God

I


m
a
ruined
and
dishonored
man

A
bullet
through
my
brain
is
the
only
thing
left
me


not
singing




his
thoughts
ran
on




Go
away

But
where
to

It


s
one


let
them
sing





He
continued
to
pace
the
room

looking
gloomily
at
Den

sov
and
the
girls
and
avoiding
their
eyes





Nik

lenka

what
is
the
matter




S

nya


s
eyes
fixed
on
him
seemed
to
ask

She
noticed
at
once
that
something
had
happened
to
him


Nicholas
turned
away
from
her

Nat

sha
too

with
her
quick
instinct

had
instantly
noticed
her
brother


s
condition

But

though
she
noticed
it

she
was
herself
in
such
high
spirits
at
that
moment

so
far
from
sorrow

sadness

or
self
reproach

that
she
purposely
deceived
herself
as
young
people
often
do




No

I
am
too
happy
now
to
spoil
my
enjoyment
by
sympathy
with
anyone


s
sorrow




she
felt

and
she
said
to
herself




No

I
must
be
mistaken

he
must
be
feeling
happy

just
as
I
am








Now

S

nya




she
said

going
to
the
very
middle
of
the
room

where
she
considered
the
resonance
was
best


Having
lifted
her
head
and
let
her
arms
droop
lifelessly

as
ballet
dancers
do

Nat

sha

rising
energetically
from
her
heels
to
her
toes

stepped
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
still





Yes

that


s
me




she
seemed
to
say

answering
the
rapt
gaze
with
which
Den

sov
followed
her





And
what
is
she
so
pleased
about




thought
Nicholas

looking
at
his
sister




Why
isn


t
she
dull
and
ashamed





Nat

sha
took
the
first
note

her
throat
swelled

her
chest
rose

her
eyes
became
serious

At
that
moment
she
was
oblivious
of
her
surroundings

and
from
her
smiling
lips
flowed
sounds
which
anyone
may
produce
at
the
same
intervals
and
hold
for
the
same
time

but
which
leave
you
cold
a
thousand
times
and
the
thousand
and
first
time
thrill
you
and
make
you
weep


Nat

sha

that
winter

had
for
the
first
time
begun
to
sing
seriously

mainly
because
Den

sov
so
delighted
in
her
singing

She
no
longer
sang
as
a
child

there
was
no
longer
in
her
singing
that
comical

childish

painstaking
effect
that
had
been
in
it
before

but
she
did
not
yet
sing
well

as
all
the
connoisseurs
who
heard
her
said




It
is
not
trained

but
it
is
a
beautiful
voice
that
must
be
trained




Only
they
generally
said
this
some
time
after
she
had
finished
singing

While
that
untrained
voice

with
its
incorrect
breathing
and
labored
transitions

was
sounding

even
the
connoisseurs
said
nothing

but
only
delighted
in
it
and
wished
to
hear
it
again

In
her
voice
there
was
a
virginal
freshness

an
unconsciousness
of
her
own
powers

and
an
as
yet
untrained
velvety
softness

which
so
mingled
with
her
lack
of
art
in
singing
that
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
in
that
voice
could
be
altered
without
spoiling
it





What
is
this




thought
Nicholas

listening
to
her
with
widely
opened
eyes




What
has
happened
to
her

How
she
is
singing
today




And
suddenly
the
whole
world
centered
for
him
on
anticipation
of
the
next
note

the
next
phrase

and
everything
in
the
world
was
divided
into
three
beats




Oh
mio
crudele
affetto







One

two

three



one

two

three



One






Oh
mio
crudele
affetto







One

two

three



One




Oh

this
senseless
life
of
ours




thought
Nicholas




All
this
misery

and
money

and
D

lokhov

and
anger

and
honor


it


s
all
nonsense



but
this
is
real




Now
then

Nat

sha

now
then

dearest

Now
then

darling

How
will
she
take
that
si

She


s
taken
it

Thank
God




And
without
noticing
that
he
was
singing

to
strengthen
the
si
he
sung
a
second

a
third
below
the
high
note




Ah

God

How
fine

Did
I
really
take
it

How
fortunate




he
thought


Oh

how
that
chord
vibrated

and
how
moved
was
something
that
was
finest
in
Rost

v


s
soul

And
this
something
was
apart
from
everything
else
in
the
world
and
above
everything
in
the
world




What
were
losses

and
D

lokhov

and
words
of
honor




All
nonsense

One
might
kill
and
rob
and
yet
be
happy












CHAPTER
XVI

It
was
long
since
Rost

v
had
felt
such
enjoyment
from
music
as
he
did
that
day

But
no
sooner
had
Nat

sha
finished
her
barcarolle
than
reality
again
presented
itself

He
got
up
without
saying
a
word
and
went
downstairs
to
his
own
room

A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
old
count
came
in
from
his
club

cheerful
and
contented

Nicholas

hearing
him
drive
up

went
to
meet
him





Well


had
a
good
time




said
the
old
count

smiling
gaily
and
proudly
at
his
son


Nicholas
tried
to
say



Yes




but
could
not

and
he
nearly
burst
into
sobs

The
count
was
lighting
his
pipe
and
did
not
notice
his
son


s
condition





Ah

it
can


t
be
avoided




thought
Nicholas

for
the
first
and
last
time

And
suddenly

in
the
most
casual
tone

which
made
him
feel
ashamed
of
himself

he
said

as
if
merely
asking
his
father
to
let
him
have
the
carriage
to
drive
to
town





Papa

I
have
come
on
a
matter
of
business

I
was
nearly
forgetting

I
need
some
money








Dear
me




said
his
father

who
was
in
a
specially
good
humor




I
told
you
it
would
not
be
enough

How
much








Very
much




said
Nicholas
flushing

and
with
a
stupid
careless
smile

for
which
he
was
long
unable
to
forgive
himself




I
have
lost
a
little

I
mean
a
good
deal

a
great
deal


forty
three
thousand








What

To
whom




Nonsense




cried
the
count

suddenly
reddening
with
an
apoplectic
flush
over
neck
and
nape
as
old
people
do





I
promised
to
pay
tomorrow




said
Nicholas





Well







said
the
old
count

spreading
out
his
arms
and
sinking
helplessly
on
the
sofa





It
can


t
be
helped

It
happens
to
everyone




said
the
son

with
a
bold

free

and
easy
tone

while
in
his
soul
he
regarded
himself
as
a
worthless
scoundrel
whose
whole
life
could
not
atone
for
his
crime

He
longed
to
kiss
his
father


s
hands
and
kneel
to
beg
his
forgiveness

but
said

in
a
careless
and
even
rude
voice

that
it
happens
to
everyone


The
old
count
cast
down
his
eyes
on
hearing
his
son


s
words
and
began
bustlingly
searching
for
something





Yes

yes




he
muttered




it
will
be
difficult

I
fear

difficult
to
raise



happens
to
everybody

Yes

who
has
not
done
it





And
with
a
furtive
glance
at
his
son


s
face

the
count
went
out
of
the
room




Nicholas
had
been
prepared
for
resistance

but
had
not
at
all
expected
this





Papa

Pa
pa




he
called
after
him

sobbing




forgive
me




And
seizing
his
father


s
hand

he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
burst
into
tears


While
father
and
son
were
having
their
explanation

the
mother
and
daughter
were
having
one
not
less
important

Nat

sha
came
running
to
her
mother

quite
excited





Mamma




Mamma




He
has
made
me










Made
what








Made

made
me
an
offer

Mamma

Mamma




she
exclaimed


The
countess
did
not
believe
her
ears

Den

sov
had
proposed

To
whom

To
this
chit
of
a
girl

Nat

sha

who
not
so
long
ago
was
playing
with
dolls
and
who
was
still
having
lessons





Don


t

Nat

sha

What
nonsense




she
said

hoping
it
was
a
joke





Nonsense

indeed

I
am
telling
you
the
fact




said
Nat

sha
indignantly




I
come
to
ask
you
what
to
do

and
you
call
it



nonsense








The
countess
shrugged
her
shoulders





If
it
is
true
that
Monsieur
Den

sov
has
made
you
a
proposal

tell
him
he
is
a
fool

that


s
all








No

he


s
not
a
fool




replied
Nat

sha
indignantly
and
seriously





Well
then

what
do
you
want

You


re
all
in
love
nowadays

Well

if
you
are
in
love

marry
him




said
the
countess

with
a
laugh
of
annoyance




Good
luck
to
you








No

Mamma

I


m
not
in
love
with
him

I
suppose
I


m
not
in
love
with
him








Well
then

tell
him
so








Mamma

are
you
cross

Don


t
be
cross

dear

Is
it
my
fault








No

but
what
is
it

my
dear

Do
you
want
me
to
go
and
tell
him




said
the
countess
smiling





No

I
will
do
it
myself

only
tell
me
what
to
say

It


s
all
very
well
for
you




said
Nat

sha

with
a
responsive
smile




You
should
have
seen
how
he
said
it

I
know
he
did
not
mean
to
say
it

but
it
came
out
accidently








Well

all
the
same

you
must
refuse
him








No

I
mustn


t

I
am
so
sorry
for
him

He


s
so
nice








Well
then

accept
his
offer

It


s
high
time
for
you
to
be
married




answered
the
countess
sharply
and
sarcastically





No

Mamma

but
I


m
so
sorry
for
him

I
don


t
know
how
I


m
to
say
it








And
there


s
nothing
for
you
to
say

I
shall
speak
to
him
myself




said
the
countess

indignant
that
they
should
have
dared
to
treat
this
little
Nat

sha
as
grown
up





No

not
on
any
account

I
will
tell
him
myself

and
you


ll
listen
at
the
door




and
Nat

sha
ran
across
the
drawing
room
to
the
dancing
hall

where
Den

sov
was
sitting
on
the
same
chair
by
the
clavichord
with
his
face
in
his
hands


He
jumped
up
at
the
sound
of
her
light
step





Nataly




he
said

moving
with
rapid
steps
toward
her




decide
my
fate

It
is
in
your
hands








Vas

li
Dm

trich

I


m
so
sorry
for
you




No

but
you
are
so
nice



but
it
won


t
do


not
that



but
as
a
friend

I
shall
always
love
you





Den

sov
bent
over
her
hand
and
she
heard
strange
sounds
she
did
not
understand

She
kissed
his
rough
curly
black
head

At
this
instant

they
heard
the
quick
rustle
of
the
countess



dress

She
came
up
to
them





Vas

li
Dm

trich

I
thank
you
for
the
honor




she
said

with
an
embarrassed
voice

though
it
sounded
severe
to
Den

sov





but
my
daughter
is
so
young

and
I
thought
that

as
my
son


s
friend

you
would
have
addressed
yourself
first
to
me

In
that
case
you
would
not
have
obliged
me
to
give
this
refusal








Countess






said
Den

sov

with
downcast
eyes
and
a
guilty
face

He
tried
to
say
more

but
faltered


Nat

sha
could
not
remain
calm

seeing
him
in
such
a
plight

She
began
to
sob
aloud





Countess

I
have
done
w


ong




Den

sov
went
on
in
an
unsteady
voice




but
believe
me

I
so
adore
your
daughter
and
all
your
family
that
I
would
give
my
life
twice
over






He
looked
at
the
countess

and
seeing
her
severe
face
said




Well

good
by

Countess




and
kissing
her
hand

he
left
the
room
with
quick
resolute
strides

without
looking
at
Nat

sha



Next
day
Rost

v
saw
Den

sov
off

He
did
not
wish
to
stay
another
day
in
Moscow

All
Den

sov


s
Moscow
friends
gave
him
a
farewell
entertainment
at
the
gypsies




with
the
result
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
how
he
was
put
in
the
sleigh
or
of
the
first
three
stages
of
his
journey


After
Den

sov


s
departure

Rost

v
spent
another
fortnight
in
Moscow

without
going
out
of
the
house

waiting
for
the
money
his
father
could
not
at
once
raise

and
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
girls



room


S

nya
was
more
tender
and
devoted
to
him
than
ever

It
was
as
if
she
wanted
to
show
him
that
his
losses
were
an
achievement
that
made
her
love
him
all
the
more

but
Nicholas
now
considered
himself
unworthy
of
her


He
filled
the
girls



albums
with
verses
and
music

and
having
at
last
sent
D

lokhov
the
whole
forty
three
thousand
rubles
and
received
his
receipt

he
left
at
the
end
of
November

without
taking
leave
of
any
of
his
acquaintances

to
overtake
his
regiment
which
was
already
in
Poland






BOOK
FIVE
















CHAPTER
I

After
his
interview
with
his
wife
Pierre
left
for
Petersburg

At
the
Torzh

k
post
station

either
there
were
no
horses
or
the
postmaster
would
not
supply
them

Pierre
was
obliged
to
wait

Without
undressing

he
lay
down
on
the
leather
sofa
in
front
of
a
round
table

put
his
big
feet
in
their
overboots
on
the
table

and
began
to
reflect





Will
you
have
the
portmanteaus
brought
in

And
a
bed
got
ready

and
tea




asked
his
valet


Pierre
gave
no
answer

for
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything

He
had
begun
to
think
of
the
last
station
and
was
still
pondering
on
the
same
question


one
so
important
that
he
took
no
notice
of
what
went
on
around
him

Not
only
was
he
indifferent
as
to
whether
he
got
to
Petersburg
earlier
or
later

or
whether
he
secured
accommodation
at
this
station

but
compared
to
the
thoughts
that
now
occupied
him
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
he
remained
there
for
a
few
hours
or
for
the
rest
of
his
life


The
postmaster

his
wife

the
valet

and
a
peasant
woman
selling
Torzh

k
embroidery
came
into
the
room
offering
their
services

Without
changing
his
careless
attitude

Pierre
looked
at
them
over
his
spectacles
unable
to
understand
what
they
wanted
or
how
they
could
go
on
living
without
having
solved
the
problems
that
so
absorbed
him

He
had
been
engrossed
by
the
same
thoughts
ever
since
the
day
he
returned
from
Sok

lniki
after
the
duel
and
had
spent
that
first
agonizing

sleepless
night

But
now

in
the
solitude
of
the
journey

they
seized
him
with
special
force

No
matter
what
he
thought
about

he
always
returned
to
these
same
questions
which
he
could
not
solve
and
yet
could
not
cease
to
ask
himself

It
was
as
if
the
thread
of
the
chief
screw
which
held
his
life
together
were
stripped

so
that
the
screw
could
not
get
in
or
out

but
went
on
turning
uselessly
in
the
same
place


The
postmaster
came
in
and
began
obsequiously
to
beg
his
excellency
to
wait
only
two
hours

when

come
what
might

he
would
let
his
excellency
have
the
courier
horses

It
was
plain
that
he
was
lying
and
only
wanted
to
get
more
money
from
the
traveler





Is
this
good
or
bad




Pierre
asked
himself




It
is
good
for
me

bad
for
another
traveler

and
for
himself
it


s
unavoidable

because
he
needs
money
for
food

the
man
said
an
officer
had
once
given
him
a
thrashing
for
letting
a
private
traveler
have
the
courier
horses

But
the
officer
thrashed
him
because
he
had
to
get
on
as
quickly
as
possible

And
I




continued
Pierre




shot
D

lokhov
because
I
considered
myself
injured

and
Louis
XVI
was
executed
because
they
considered
him
a
criminal

and
a
year
later
they
executed
those
who
executed
him


also
for
some
reason

What
is
bad

What
is
good

What
should
one
love
and
what
hate

What
does
one
live
for

And
what
am
I

What
is
life

and
what
is
death

What
power
governs
all





There
was
no
answer
to
any
of
these
questions

except
one

and
that
not
a
logical
answer
and
not
at
all
a
reply
to
them

The
answer
was




You


ll
die
and
all
will
end

You


ll
die
and
know
all

or
cease
asking




But
dying
was
also
dreadful


The
Torzh

k
peddler
woman

in
a
whining
voice

went
on
offering
her
wares

especially
a
pair
of
goatskin
slippers




I
have
hundreds
of
rubles
I
don


t
know
what
to
do
with

and
she
stands
in
her
tattered
cloak
looking
timidly
at
me




he
thought




And
what
does
she
want
the
money
for

As
if
that
money
could
add
a
hair


s
breadth
to
happiness
or
peace
of
mind

Can
anything
in
the
world
make
her
or
me
less
a
prey
to
evil
and
death



death
which
ends
all
and
must
come
today
or
tomorrow


at
any
rate

in
an
instant
as
compared
with
eternity




And
again
he
twisted
the
screw
with
the
stripped
thread

and
again
it
turned
uselessly
in
the
same
place


His
servant
handed
him
a
half
cut
novel

in
the
form
of
letters

by
Madame
de
Souza

He
began
reading
about
the
sufferings
and
virtuous
struggles
of
a
certain
Emilie
de
Mansfeld




And
why
did
she
resist
her
seducer
when
she
loved
him




he
thought




God
could
not
have
put
into
her
heart
an
impulse
that
was
against
His
will

My
wife


as
she
once
was


did
not
struggle

and
perhaps
she
was
right

Nothing
has
been
found
out

nothing
discovered




Pierre
again
said
to
himself




All
we
can
know
is
that
we
know
nothing

And
that


s
the
height
of
human
wisdom





Everything
within
and
around
him
seemed
confused

senseless

and
repellent

Yet
in
this
very
repugnance
to
all
his
circumstances
Pierre
found
a
kind
of
tantalizing
satisfaction





I
make
bold
to
ask
your
excellency
to
move
a
little
for
this
gentleman




said
the
postmaster

entering
the
room
followed
by
another
traveler

also
detained
for
lack
of
horses


The
newcomer
was
a
short

large
boned

yellow
faced

wrinkled
old
man

with
gray
bushy
eyebrows
overhanging
bright
eyes
of
an
indefinite
grayish
color


Pierre
took
his
feet
off
the
table

stood
up

and
lay
down
on
a
bed
that
had
been
got
ready
for
him

glancing
now
and
then
at
the
newcomer

who

with
a
gloomy
and
tired
face

was
wearily
taking
off
his
wraps
with
the
aid
of
his
servant

and
not
looking
at
Pierre

With
a
pair
of
felt
boots
on
his
thin
bony
legs

and
keeping
on
a
worn

nankeen
covered

sheepskin
coat

the
traveler
sat
down
on
the
sofa

leaned
back
his
big
head
with
its
broad
temples
and
close
cropped
hair

and
looked
at
Bez

khov

The
stern

shrewd

and
penetrating
expression
of
that
look
struck
Pierre

He
felt
a
wish
to
speak
to
the
stranger

but
by
the
time
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
him
a
question
about
the
roads

the
traveler
had
closed
his
eyes

His
shriveled
old
hands
were
folded
and
on
the
finger
of
one
of
them
Pierre
noticed
a
large
cast
iron
ring
with
a
seal
representing
a
death


s
head

The
stranger
sat
without
stirring

either
resting
or

as
it
seemed
to
Pierre

sunk
in
profound
and
calm
meditation

His
servant
was
also
a
yellow

wrinkled
old
man

without
beard
or
mustache

evidently
not
because
he
was
shaven
but
because
they
had
never
grown

This
active
old
servant
was
unpacking
the
traveler


s
canteen
and
preparing
tea

He
brought
in
a
boiling
samovar

When
everything
was
ready

the
stranger
opened
his
eyes

moved
to
the
table

filled
a
tumbler
with
tea
for
himself
and
one
for
the
beardless
old
man
to
whom
he
passed
it

Pierre
began
to
feel
a
sense
of
uneasiness

and
the
need

even
the
inevitability

of
entering
into
conversation
with
this
stranger


The
servant
brought
back
his
tumbler
turned
upside
down



with
an
unfinished
bit
of
nibbled
sugar

and
asked
if
anything
more
would
be
wanted








To
indicate
he
did
not
want
more
tea





No

Give
me
the
book




said
the
stranger


The
servant
handed
him
a
book
which
Pierre
took
to
be
a
devotional
work

and
the
traveler
became
absorbed
in
it

Pierre
looked
at
him

All
at
once
the
stranger
closed
the
book

putting
in
a
marker

and
again

leaning
with
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
sofa

sat
in
his
former
position
with
his
eyes
shut

Pierre
looked
at
him
and
had
not
time
to
turn
away
when
the
old
man

opening
his
eyes

fixed
his
steady
and
severe
gaze
straight
on
Pierre


s
face


Pierre
felt
confused
and
wished
to
avoid
that
look

but
the
bright
old
eyes
attracted
him
irresistibly






CHAPTER
II




I
have
the
pleasure
of
addressing
Count
Bez

khov

if
I
am
not
mistaken




said
the
stranger
in
a
deliberate
and
loud
voice


Pierre
looked
silently
and
inquiringly
at
him
over
his
spectacles





I
have
heard
of
you

my
dear
sir




continued
the
stranger




and
of
your
misfortune




He
seemed
to
emphasize
the
last
word

as
if
to
say





Yes

misfortune

Call
it
what
you
please

I
know
that
what
happened
to
you
in
Moscow
was
a
misfortune









I
regret
it
very
much

my
dear
sir





Pierre
flushed
and

hurriedly
putting
his
legs
down
from
the
bed

bent
forward
toward
the
old
man
with
a
forced
and
timid
smile





I
have
not
referred
to
this
out
of
curiosity

my
dear
sir

but
for
greater
reasons





He
paused

his
gaze
still
on
Pierre

and
moved
aside
on
the
sofa
by
way
of
inviting
the
other
to
take
a
seat
beside
him

Pierre
felt
reluctant
to
enter
into
conversation
with
this
old
man

but

submitting
to
him
involuntarily

came
up
and
sat
down
beside
him





You
are
unhappy

my
dear
sir




the
stranger
continued




You
are
young
and
I
am
old

I
should
like
to
help
you
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power








Oh

yes




said
Pierre

with
a
forced
smile




I
am
very
grateful
to
you

Where
are
you
traveling
from





The
stranger


s
face
was
not
genial

it
was
even
cold
and
severe

but
in
spite
of
this

both
the
face
and
words
of
his
new
acquaintance
were
irresistibly
attractive
to
Pierre





But
if
for
any
reason
you
don


t
feel
inclined
to
talk
to
me




said
the
old
man




say
so

my
dear
sir




And
he
suddenly
smiled

in
an
unexpected
and
tenderly
paternal
way





Oh
no

not
at
all

On
the
contrary

I
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance




said
Pierre

And
again

glancing
at
the
stranger


s
hands

he
looked
more
closely
at
the
ring

with
its
skull


a
Masonic
sign





Allow
me
to
ask




he
said




are
you
a
Mason








Yes

I
belong
to
the
Brotherhood
of
the
Freemasons




said
the
stranger

looking
deeper
and
deeper
into
Pierre


s
eyes




And
in
their
name
and
my
own
I
hold
out
a
brotherly
hand
to
you








I
am
afraid




said
Pierre

smiling

and
wavering
between
the
confidence
the
personality
of
the
Freemason
inspired
in
him
and
his
own
habit
of
ridiculing
the
Masonic
beliefs





I
am
afraid
I
am
very
far
from
understanding


how
am
I
to
put
it



I
am
afraid
my
way
of
looking
at
the
world
is
so
opposed
to
yours
that
we
shall
not
understand
one
another








I
know
your
outlook




said
the
Mason




and
the
view
of
life
you
mention

and
which
you
think
is
the
result
of
your
own
mental
efforts

is
the
one
held
by
the
majority
of
people

and
is
the
invariable
fruit
of
pride

indolence

and
ignorance

Forgive
me

my
dear
sir

but
if
I
had
not
known
it
I
should
not
have
addressed
you

Your
view
of
life
is
a
regrettable
delusion








Just
as
I
may
suppose
you
to
be
deluded




said
Pierre

with
a
faint
smile





I
should
never
dare
to
say
that
I
know
the
truth




said
the
Mason

whose
words
struck
Pierre
more
and
more
by
their
precision
and
firmness




No
one
can
attain
to
truth
by
himself

Only
by
laying
stone
on
stone
with
the
cooperation
of
all

by
the
millions
of
generations
from
our
forefather
Adam
to
our
own
times

is
that
temple
reared
which
is
to
be
a
worthy
dwelling
place
of
the
Great
God




he
added

and
closed
his
eyes





I
ought
to
tell
you
that
I
do
not
believe



do
not
believe
in
God




said
Pierre

regretfully
and
with
an
effort

feeling
it
essential
to
speak
the
whole
truth


The
Mason
looked
intently
at
Pierre
and
smiled
as
a
rich
man
with
millions
in
hand
might
smile
at
a
poor
fellow
who
told
him
that
he

poor
man

had
not
the
five
rubles
that
would
make
him
happy





Yes

you
do
not
know
Him

my
dear
sir




said
the
Mason




You
cannot
know
Him

You
do
not
know
Him
and
that
is
why
you
are
unhappy








Yes

yes

I
am
unhappy




assented
Pierre




But
what
am
I
to
do








You
know
Him
not

my
dear
sir

and
so
you
are
very
unhappy

You
do
not
know
Him

but
He
is
here

He
is
in
me

He
is
in
my
words

He
is
in
thee

and
even
in
those
blasphemous
words
thou
hast
just
uttered




pronounced
the
Mason
in
a
stern
and
tremulous
voice


He
paused
and
sighed

evidently
trying
to
calm
himself





If
He
were
not




he
said
quietly




you
and
I
would
not
be
speaking
of
Him

my
dear
sir

Of
what

of
whom

are
we
speaking

Whom
hast
thou
denied




he
suddenly
asked
with
exulting
austerity
and
authority
in
his
voice




Who
invented
Him

if
He
did
not
exist

Whence
came
thy
conception
of
the
existence
of
such
an
incomprehensible
Being

didst
thou

and
why
did
the
whole
world

conceive
the
idea
of
the
existence
of
such
an
incomprehensible
Being

a
Being
all
powerful

eternal

and
infinite
in
all
His
attributes








He
stopped
and
remained
silent
for
a
long
time


Pierre
could
not
and
did
not
wish
to
break
this
silence





He
exists

but
to
understand
Him
is
hard




the
Mason
began
again

looking
not
at
Pierre
but
straight
before
him

and
turning
the
leaves
of
his
book
with
his
old
hands
which
from
excitement
he
could
not
keep
still




If
it
were
a
man
whose
existence
thou
didst
doubt
I
could
bring
him
to
thee

could
take
him
by
the
hand
and
show
him
to
thee

But
how
can
I

an
insignificant
mortal

show
His
omnipotence

His
infinity

and
all
His
mercy
to
one
who
is
blind

or
who
shuts
his
eyes
that
he
may
not
see
or
understand
Him
and
may
not
see
or
understand
his
own
vileness
and
sinfulness




He
paused
again




Who
art
thou

Thou
dreamest
that
thou
art
wise
because
thou
couldst
utter
those
blasphemous
words




he
went
on

with
a
somber
and
scornful
smile




And
thou
art
more
foolish
and
unreasonable
than
a
little
child

who

playing
with
the
parts
of
a
skillfully
made
watch

dares
to
say
that

as
he
does
not
understand
its
use

he
does
not
believe
in
the
master
who
made
it

To
know
Him
is
hard




For
ages

from
our
forefather
Adam
to
our
own
day

we
labor
to
attain
that
knowledge
and
are
still
infinitely
far
from
our
aim

but
in
our
lack
of
understanding
we
see
only
our
weakness
and
His
greatness








Pierre
listened
with
swelling
heart

gazing
into
the
Mason


s
face
with
shining
eyes

not
interrupting
or
questioning
him

but
believing
with
his
whole
soul
what
the
stranger
said

Whether
he
accepted
the
wise
reasoning
contained
in
the
Mason


s
words

or
believed
as
a
child
believes

in
the
speaker


s
tone
of
conviction
and
earnestness

or
the
tremor
of
the
speaker


s
voice


which
sometimes
almost
broke


or
those
brilliant
aged
eyes
grown
old
in
this
conviction

or
the
calm
firmness
and
certainty
of
his
vocation

which
radiated
from
his
whole
being

and
which
struck
Pierre
especially
by
contrast
with
his
own
dejection
and
hopelessness



at
any
rate

Pierre
longed
with
his
whole
soul
to
believe
and
he
did
believe

and
felt
a
joyful
sense
of
comfort

regeneration

and
return
to
life





He
is
not
to
be
apprehended
by
reason

but
by
life




said
the
Mason





I
do
not
understand




said
Pierre

feeling
with
dismay
doubts
reawakening

He
was
afraid
of
any
want
of
clearness

any
weakness

in
the
Mason


s
arguments

he
dreaded
not
to
be
able
to
believe
in
him




I
don


t
understand




he
said




how
it
is
that
the
mind
of
man
cannot
attain
the
knowledge
of
which
you
speak





The
Mason
smiled
with
his
gentle
fatherly
smile





The
highest
wisdom
and
truth
are
like
the
purest
liquid
we
may
wish
to
imbibe




he
said




Can
I
receive
that
pure
liquid
into
an
impure
vessel
and
judge
of
its
purity

Only
by
the
inner
purification
of
myself
can
I
retain
in
some
degree
of
purity
the
liquid
I
receive








Yes

yes

that
is
so




said
Pierre
joyfully





The
highest
wisdom
is
not
founded
on
reason
alone

not
on
those
worldly
sciences
of
physics

history

chemistry

and
the
like

into
which
intellectual
knowledge
is
divided

The
highest
wisdom
is
one

The
highest
wisdom
has
but
one
science


the
science
of
the
whole


the
science
explaining
the
whole
creation
and
man


s
place
in
it

To
receive
that
science
it
is
necessary
to
purify
and
renew
one


s
inner
self

and
so
before
one
can
know

it
is
necessary
to
believe
and
to
perfect
one


s
self

And
to
attain
this
end

we
have
the
light
called
conscience
that
God
has
implanted
in
our
souls








Yes

yes




assented
Pierre





Look
then
at
thy
inner
self
with
the
eyes
of
the
spirit

and
ask
thyself
whether
thou
art
content
with
thyself

What
hast
thou
attained
relying
on
reason
only

What
art
thou

You
are
young

you
are
rich

you
are
clever

you
are
well
educated

And
what
have
you
done
with
all
these
good
gifts

Are
you
content
with
yourself
and
with
your
life








No

I
hate
my
life




Pierre
muttered

wincing





Thou
hatest
it

Then
change
it

purify
thyself

and
as
thou
art
purified

thou
wilt
gain
wisdom

Look
at
your
life

my
dear
sir

How
have
you
spent
it

In
riotous
orgies
and
debauchery

receiving
everything
from
society
and
giving
nothing
in
return

You
have
become
the
possessor
of
wealth

How
have
you
used
it

What
have
you
done
for
your
neighbor

Have
you
ever
thought
of
your
tens
of
thousands
of
slaves

Have
you
helped
them
physically
and
morally

No

You
have
profited
by
their
toil
to
lead
a
profligate
life

That
is
what
you
have
done

Have
you
chosen
a
post
in
which
you
might
be
of
service
to
your
neighbor

No

You
have
spent
your
life
in
idleness

Then
you
married

my
dear
sir


took
on
yourself
responsibility
for
the
guidance
of
a
young
woman

and
what
have
you
done

You
have
not
helped
her
to
find
the
way
of
truth

my
dear
sir

but
have
thrust
her
into
an
abyss
of
deceit
and
misery

A
man
offended
you
and
you
shot
him

and
you
say
you
do
not
know
God
and
hate
your
life

There
is
nothing
strange
in
that

my
dear
sir





After
these
words

the
Mason

as
if
tired
by
his
long
discourse

again
leaned
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
closed
his
eyes

Pierre
looked
at
that
aged

stern

motionless

almost
lifeless
face
and
moved
his
lips
without
uttering
a
sound

He
wished
to
say




Yes

a
vile

idle

vicious
life




but
dared
not
break
the
silence


The
Mason
cleared
his
throat
huskily

as
old
men
do

and
called
his
servant





How
about
the
horses




he
asked

without
looking
at
Pierre





The
exchange
horses
have
just
come




answered
the
servant




Will
you
not
rest
here








No

tell
them
to
harness








Can
he
really
be
going
away
leaving
me
alone
without
having
told
me
all

and
without
promising
to
help
me




thought
Pierre

rising
with
downcast
head

and
he
began
to
pace
the
room

glancing
occasionally
at
the
Mason




Yes

I
never
thought
of
it

but
I
have
led
a
contemptible
and
profligate
life

though
I
did
not
like
it
and
did
not
want
to




thought
Pierre




But
this
man
knows
the
truth
and

if
he
wished
to

could
disclose
it
to
me





Pierre
wished
to
say
this
to
the
Mason

but
did
not
dare
to

The
traveler

having
packed
his
things
with
his
practiced
hands

began
fastening
his
coat

When
he
had
finished

he
turned
to
Bez

khov

and
said
in
a
tone
of
indifferent
politeness





Where
are
you
going
to
now

my
dear
sir








I




I


m
going
to
Petersburg




answered
Pierre

in
a
childlike

hesitating
voice




I
thank
you

I
agree
with
all
you
have
said

But
do
not
suppose
me
to
be
so
bad

With
my
whole
soul
I
wish
to
be
what
you
would
have
me
be

but
I
have
never
had
help
from
anyone




But
it
is
I

above
all

who
am
to
blame
for
everything

Help
me

teach
me

and
perhaps
I
may







Pierre
could
not
go
on

He
gulped
and
turned
away


The
Mason
remained
silent
for
a
long
time

evidently
considering





Help
comes
from
God
alone




he
said




but
such
measure
of
help
as
our
Order
can
bestow
it
will
render
you

my
dear
sir

You
are
going
to
Petersburg

Hand
this
to
Count
Willarski




he
took
out
his
notebook
and
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
folded
in
four





Allow
me
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice

When
you
reach
the
capital

first
of
all
devote
some
time
to
solitude
and
self
examination
and
do
not
resume
your
former
way
of
life

And
now
I
wish
you
a
good
journey

my
dear
sir




he
added

seeing
that
his
servant
had
entered






and
success





The
traveler
was
Joseph
Alex

evich
Bazd

ev

as
Pierre
saw
from
the
postmaster


s
book

Bazd

ev
had
been
one
of
the
best
known
Freemasons
and
Martinists

even
in
Nov

kov


s
time

For
a
long
while
after
he
had
gone

Pierre
did
not
go
to
bed
or
order
horses
but
paced
up
and
down
the
room

pondering
over
his
vicious
past

and
with
a
rapturous
sense
of
beginning
anew
pictured
to
himself
the
blissful

irreproachable

virtuous
future
that
seemed
to
him
so
easy

It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
vicious
only
because
he
had
somehow
forgotten
how
good
it
is
to
be
virtuous

Not
a
trace
of
his
former
doubts
remained
in
his
soul

He
firmly
believed
in
the
possibility
of
the
brotherhood
of
men
united
in
the
aim
of
supporting
one
another
in
the
path
of
virtue

and
that
is
how
Freemasonry
presented
itself
to
him






CHAPTER
III

On
reaching
Petersburg
Pierre
did
not
let
anyone
know
of
his
arrival

he
went
nowhere
and
spent
whole
days
in
reading
Thomas



Kempis

whose
book
had
been
sent
him
by
someone
unknown

One
thing
he
continually
realized
as
he
read
that
book

the
joy

hitherto
unknown
to
him

of
believing
in
the
possibility
of
attaining
perfection

and
in
the
possibility
of
active
brotherly
love
among
men

which
Joseph
Alex

evich
had
revealed
to
him

A
week
after
his
arrival

the
young
Polish
count

Willarski

whom
Pierre
had
known
slightly
in
Petersburg
society

came
into
his
room
one
evening
in
the
official
and
ceremonious
manner
in
which
D

lokhov


s
second
had
called
on
him

and

having
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
room

addressed
Pierre





I
have
come
to
you
with
a
message
and
an
offer

Count




he
said
without
sitting
down




A
person
of
very
high
standing
in
our
Brotherhood
has
made
application
for
you
to
be
received
into
our
Order
before
the
usual
term
and
has
proposed
to
me
to
be
your
sponsor

I
consider
it
a
sacred
duty
to
fulfill
that
person


s
wishes

Do
you
wish
to
enter
the
Brotherhood
of
Freemasons
under
my
sponsorship





The
cold

austere
tone
of
this
man

whom
he
had
almost
always
before
met
at
balls

amiably
smiling
in
the
society
of
the
most
brilliant
women

surprised
Pierre





Yes

I
do
wish
it




said
he


Willarski
bowed
his
head





One
more
question

Count




he
said




which
I
beg
you
to
answer
in
all
sincerity


not
as
a
future
Mason
but
as
an
honest
man

have
you
renounced
your
former
convictions


do
you
believe
in
God





Pierre
considered





Yes



yes

I
believe
in
God




he
said





In
that
case






began
Willarski

but
Pierre
interrupted
him





Yes

I
do
believe
in
God




he
repeated





In
that
case
we
can
go




said
Willarski




My
carriage
is
at
your
service





Willarski
was
silent
throughout
the
drive

To
Pierre


s
inquiries
as
to
what
he
must
do
and
how
he
should
answer

Willarski
only
replied
that
brothers
more
worthy
than
he
would
test
him
and
that
Pierre
had
only
to
tell
the
truth


Having
entered
the
courtyard
of
a
large
house
where
the
Lodge
had
its
headquarters

and
having
ascended
a
dark
staircase

they
entered
a
small
well
lit
anteroom
where
they
took
off
their
cloaks
without
the
aid
of
a
servant

From
there
they
passed
into
another
room

A
man
in
strange
attire
appeared
at
the
door

Willarski

stepping
toward
him

said
something
to
him
in
French
in
an
undertone
and
then
went
up
to
a
small
wardrobe
in
which
Pierre
noticed
garments
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before

Having
taken
a
kerchief
from
the
cupboard

Willarski
bound
Pierre


s
eyes
with
it
and
tied
it
in
a
knot
behind

catching
some
hairs
painfully
in
the
knot

Then
he
drew
his
face
down

kissed
him

and
taking
him
by
the
hand
led
him
forward

The
hairs
tied
in
the
knot
hurt
Pierre
and
there
were
lines
of
pain
on
his
face
and
a
shamefaced
smile

His
huge
figure

with
arms
hanging
down
and
with
a
puckered

though
smiling
face

moved
after
Willarski
with
uncertain

timid
steps


Having
led
him
about
ten
paces

Willarski
stopped





Whatever
happens
to
you




he
said




you
must
bear
it
all
manfully
if
you
have
firmly
resolved
to
join
our
Brotherhood





Pierre
nodded
affirmatively





When
you
hear
a
knock
at
the
door

you
will
uncover
your
eyes




added
Willarski




I
wish
you
courage
and
success




and

pressing
Pierre


s
hand

he
went
out


Left
alone

Pierre
went
on
smiling
in
the
same
way

Once
or
twice
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
hand
to
the
kerchief

as
if
wishing
to
take
it
off

but
let
it
drop
again

The
five
minutes
spent
with
his
eyes
bandaged
seemed
to
him
an
hour

His
arms
felt
numb

his
legs
almost
gave
way

it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
tired
out

He
experienced
a
variety
of
most
complex
sensations

He
felt
afraid
of
what
would
happen
to
him
and
still
more
afraid
of
showing
his
fear

He
felt
curious
to
know
what
was
going
to
happen
and
what
would
be
revealed
to
him

but
most
of
all

he
felt
joyful
that
the
moment
had
come
when
he
would
at
last
start
on
that
path
of
regeneration
and
on
the
actively
virtuous
life
of
which
he
had
been
dreaming
since
he
met
Joseph
Alex

evich

Loud
knocks
were
heard
at
the
door

Pierre
took
the
bandage
off
his
eyes
and
glanced
around
him

The
room
was
in
black
darkness

only
a
small
lamp
was
burning
inside
something
white

Pierre
went
nearer
and
saw
that
the
lamp
stood
on
a
black
table
on
which
lay
an
open
book

The
book
was
the
Gospel

and
the
white
thing
with
the
lamp
inside
was
a
human
skull
with
its
cavities
and
teeth

After
reading
the
first
words
of
the
Gospel




In
the
beginning
was
the
Word
and
the
Word
was
with
God




Pierre
went
round
the
table
and
saw
a
large
open
box
filled
with
something

It
was
a
coffin
with
bones
inside

He
was
not
at
all
surprised
by
what
he
saw

Hoping
to
enter
on
an
entirely
new
life
quite
unlike
the
old
one

he
expected
everything
to
be
unusual

even
more
unusual
than
what
he
was
seeing

A
skull

a
coffin

the
Gospel


it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
expected
all
this
and
even
more

Trying
to
stimulate
his
emotions
he
looked
around




God

death

love

the
brotherhood
of
man




he
kept
saying
to
himself

associating
these
words
with
vague
yet
joyful
ideas

The
door
opened
and
someone
came
in


By
the
dim
light

to
which
Pierre
had
already
become
accustomed

he
saw
a
rather
short
man

Having
evidently
come
from
the
light
into
the
darkness

the
man
paused

then
moved
with
cautious
steps
toward
the
table
and
placed
on
it
his
small
leather
gloved
hands


This
short
man
had
on
a
white
leather
apron
which
covered
his
chest
and
part
of
his
legs

he
had
on
a
kind
of
necklace
above
which
rose
a
high
white
ruffle

outlining
his
rather
long
face
which
was
lit
up
from
below





For
what
have
you
come
hither




asked
the
newcomer

turning
in
Pierre


s
direction
at
a
slight
rustle
made
by
the
latter




Why
have
you

who
do
not
believe
in
the
truth
of
the
light
and
who
have
not
seen
the
light

come
here

What
do
you
seek
from
us

Wisdom

virtue

enlightenment





At
the
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
stranger
came
in

Pierre
felt
a
sense
of
awe
and
veneration
such
as
he
had
experienced
in
his
boyhood
at
confession

he
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
one
socially
a
complete
stranger

yet
nearer
to
him
through
the
brotherhood
of
man

With
bated
breath
and
beating
heart
he
moved
toward
the
Rhetor

by
which
name
the
brother
who
prepared
a
seeker
for
entrance
into
the
Brotherhood
was
known


Drawing
nearer

he
recognized
in
the
Rhetor
a
man
he
knew

Smolyan

nov

and
it
mortified
him
to
think
that
the
newcomer
was
an
acquaintance


he
wished
him
simply
a
brother
and
a
virtuous
instructor

For
a
long
time
he
could
not
utter
a
word

so
that
the
Rhetor
had
to
repeat
his
question





Yes



I



I



desire
regeneration




Pierre
uttered
with
difficulty





Very
well




said
Smolyan

nov

and
went
on
at
once




Have
you
any
idea
of
the
means
by
which
our
holy
Order
will
help
you
to
reach
your
aim




said
he
quietly
and
quickly





I



hope



for
guidance



help



in
regeneration




said
Pierre

with
a
trembling
voice
and
some
difficulty
in
utterance
due
to
his
excitement
and
to
being
unaccustomed
to
speak
of
abstract
matters
in
Russian





What
is
your
conception
of
Freemasonry








I
imagine
that
Freemasonry
is
the
fraternity
and
equality
of
men
who
have
virtuous
aims




said
Pierre

feeling
ashamed
of
the
inadequacy
of
his
words
for
the
solemnity
of
the
moment

as
he
spoke




I
imagine










Good




said
the
Rhetor
quickly

apparently
satisfied
with
this
answer




Have
you
sought
for
means
of
attaining
your
aim
in
religion








No

I
considered
it
erroneous
and
did
not
follow
it




said
Pierre

so
softly
that
the
Rhetor
did
not
hear
him
and
asked
him
what
he
was
saying




I
have
been
an
atheist




answered
Pierre





You
are
seeking
for
truth
in
order
to
follow
its
laws
in
your
life

therefore
you
seek
wisdom
and
virtue

Is
that
not
so




said
the
Rhetor

after
a
moment


s
pause





Yes

yes




assented
Pierre


The
Rhetor
cleared
his
throat

crossed
his
gloved
hands
on
his
breast

and
began
to
speak





Now
I
must
disclose
to
you
the
chief
aim
of
our
Order




he
said




and
if
this
aim
coincides
with
yours

you
may
enter
our
Brotherhood
with
profit

The
first
and
chief
object
of
our
Order

the
foundation
on
which
it
rests
and
which
no
human
power
can
destroy

is
the
preservation
and
handing
on
to
posterity
of
a
certain
important
mystery



which
has
come
down
to
us
from
the
remotest
ages

even
from
the
first
man


a
mystery
on
which
perhaps
the
fate
of
mankind
depends

But
since
this
mystery
is
of
such
a
nature
that
nobody
can
know
or
use
it
unless
he
be
prepared
by
long
and
diligent
self
purification

not
everyone
can
hope
to
attain
it
quickly

Hence
we
have
a
secondary
aim

that
of
preparing
our
members
as
much
as
possible
to
reform
their
hearts

to
purify
and
enlighten
their
minds

by
means
handed
on
to
us
by
tradition
from
those
who
have
striven
to
attain
this
mystery

and
thereby
to
render
them
capable
of
receiving
it





By
purifying
and
regenerating
our
members
we
try

thirdly

to
improve
the
whole
human
race

offering
it
in
our
members
an
example
of
piety
and
virtue

and
thereby
try
with
all
our
might
to
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
world

Think
this
over
and
I
will
come
to
you
again








To
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
world






Pierre
repeated

and
a
mental
image
of
his
future
activity
in
this
direction
rose
in
his
mind

He
imagined
men
such
as
he
had
himself
been
a
fortnight
ago

and
he
addressed
an
edifying
exhortation
to
them

He
imagined
to
himself
vicious
and
unfortunate
people
whom
he
would
assist
by
word
and
deed

imagined
oppressors
whose
victims
he
would
rescue

Of
the
three
objects
mentioned
by
the
Rhetor

this
last

that
of
improving
mankind

especially
appealed
to
Pierre

The
important
mystery
mentioned
by
the
Rhetor

though
it
aroused
his
curiosity

did
not
seem
to
him
essential

and
the
second
aim

that
of
purifying
and
regenerating
himself

did
not
much
interest
him
because
at
that
moment
he
felt
with
delight
that
he
was
already
perfectly
cured
of
his
former
faults
and
was
ready
for
all
that
was
good


Half
an
hour
later

the
Rhetor
returned
to
inform
the
seeker
of
the
seven
virtues

corresponding
to
the
seven
steps
of
Solomon


s
temple

which
every
Freemason
should
cultivate
in
himself

These
virtues
were




Discretion

the
keeping
of
the
secrets
of
the
Order




Obedience
to
those
of
higher
ranks
in
the
Order




Morality




Love
of
mankind




Courage




Generosity




The
love
of
death





In
the
seventh
place

try

by
the
frequent
thought
of
death




the
Rhetor
said




to
bring
yourself
to
regard
it
not
as
a
dreaded
foe

but
as
a
friend
that
frees
the
soul
grown
weary
in
the
labors
of
virtue
from
this
distressful
life

and
leads
it
to
its
place
of
recompense
and
peace








Yes

that
must
be
so




thought
Pierre

when
after
these
words
the
Rhetor
went
away

leaving
him
to
solitary
meditation




It
must
be
so

but
I
am
still
so
weak
that
I
love
my
life

the
meaning
of
which
is
only
now
gradually
opening
before
me




But
five
of
the
other
virtues
which
Pierre
recalled

counting
them
on
his
fingers

he
felt
already
in
his
soul

courage

generosity

morality

love
of
mankind

and
especially
obedience


which
did
not
even
seem
to
him
a
virtue

but
a
joy


He
now
felt
so
glad
to
be
free
from
his
own
lawlessness
and
to
submit
his
will
to
those
who
knew
the
indubitable
truth


He
forgot
what
the
seventh
virtue
was
and
could
not
recall
it


The
third
time
the
Rhetor
came
back
more
quickly
and
asked
Pierre
whether
he
was
still
firm
in
his
intention
and
determined
to
submit
to
all
that
would
be
required
of
him





I
am
ready
for
everything




said
Pierre





I
must
also
inform
you




said
the
Rhetor




that
our
Order
delivers
its
teaching
not
in
words
only
but
also
by
other
means

which
may
perhaps
have
a
stronger
effect
on
the
sincere
seeker
after
wisdom
and
virtue
than
mere
words

This
chamber
with
what
you
see
therein
should
already
have
suggested
to
your
heart

if
it
is
sincere

more
than
words
could
do

You
will
perhaps
also
see
in
your
further
initiation
a
like
method
of
enlightenment

Our
Order
imitates
the
ancient
societies
that
explained
their
teaching
by
hieroglyphics

A
hieroglyph




said
the
Rhetor




is
an
emblem
of
something
not
cognizable
by
the
senses
but
which
possesses
qualities
resembling
those
of
the
symbol





Pierre
knew
very
well
what
a
hieroglyph
was

but
dared
not
speak

He
listened
to
the
Rhetor
in
silence

feeling
from
all
he
said
that
his
ordeal
was
about
to
begin





If
you
are
resolved

I
must
begin
your
initiation




said
the
Rhetor
coming
closer
to
Pierre




In
token
of
generosity
I
ask
you
to
give
me
all
your
valuables








But
I
have
nothing
here




replied
Pierre

supposing
that
he
was
asked
to
give
up
all
he
possessed





What
you
have
with
you

watch

money

rings








Pierre
quickly
took
out
his
purse
and
watch

but
could
not
manage
for
some
time
to
get
the
wedding
ring
off
his
fat
finger

When
that
had
been
done

the
Rhetor
said





In
token
of
obedience

I
ask
you
to
undress





Pierre
took
off
his
coat

waistcoat

and
left
boot
according
to
the
Rhetor


s
instructions

The
Mason
drew
the
shirt
back
from
Pierre


s
left
breast

and
stooping
down
pulled
up
the
left
leg
of
his
trousers
to
above
the
knee

Pierre
hurriedly
began
taking
off
his
right
boot
also
and
was
going
to
tuck
up
the
other
trouser
leg
to
save
this
stranger
the
trouble

but
the
Mason
told
him
that
was
not
necessary
and
gave
him
a
slipper
for
his
left
foot

With
a
childlike
smile
of
embarrassment

doubt

and
self
derision

which
appeared
on
his
face
against
his
will

Pierre
stood
with
his
arms
hanging
down
and
legs
apart

before
his
brother
Rhetor

and
awaited
his
further
commands





And
now

in
token
of
candor

I
ask
you
to
reveal
to
me
your
chief
passion




said
the
latter





My
passion

I
have
had
so
many




replied
Pierre





That
passion
which
more
than
all
others
caused
you
to
waver
on
the
path
of
virtue




said
the
Mason


Pierre
paused

seeking
a
reply





Wine

Gluttony

Idleness

Laziness

Irritability

Anger

Women




He
went
over
his
vices
in
his
mind

not
knowing
to
which
of
them
to
give
the
pre
eminence





Women




he
said
in
a
low

scarcely
audible
voice


The
Mason
did
not
move
and
for
a
long
time
said
nothing
after
this
answer

At
last
he
moved
up
to
Pierre
and

taking
the
kerchief
that
lay
on
the
table

again
bound
his
eyes





For
the
last
time
I
say
to
you


turn
all
your
attention
upon
yourself

put
a
bridle
on
your
senses

and
seek
blessedness

not
in
passion
but
in
your
own
heart

The
source
of
blessedness
is
not
without
us
but
within








Pierre
had
already
long
been
feeling
in
himself
that
refreshing
source
of
blessedness
which
now
flooded
his
heart
with
glad
emotion






CHAPTER
IV

Soon
after
this
there
came
into
the
dark
chamber
to
fetch
Pierre

not
the
Rhetor
but
Pierre


s
sponsor

Willarski

whom
he
recognized
by
his
voice

To
fresh
questions
as
to
the
firmness
of
his
resolution
Pierre
replied




Yes

yes

I
agree




and
with
a
beaming

childlike
smile

his
fat
chest
uncovered

stepping
unevenly
and
timidly
in
one
slippered
and
one
booted
foot

he
advanced

while
Willarski
held
a
sword
to
his
bare
chest

He
was
conducted
from
that
room
along
passages
that
turned
backwards
and
forwards
and
was
at
last
brought
to
the
doors
of
the
Lodge

Willarski
coughed

he
was
answered
by
the
Masonic
knock
with
mallets

the
doors
opened
before
them

A
bass
voice

Pierre
was
still
blindfolded

questioned
him
as
to
who
he
was

when
and
where
he
was
born

and
so
on

Then
he
was
again
led
somewhere
still
blindfolded

and
as
they
went
along
he
was
told
allegories
of
the
toils
of
his
pilgrimage

of
holy
friendship

of
the
Eternal
Architect
of
the
universe

and
of
the
courage
with
which
he
should
endure
toils
and
dangers

During
these
wanderings

Pierre
noticed
that
he
was
spoken
of
now
as
the



Seeker




now
as
the



Sufferer




and
now
as
the



Postulant




to
the
accompaniment
of
various
knockings
with
mallets
and
swords

As
he
was
being
led
up
to
some
object
he
noticed
a
hesitation
and
uncertainty
among
his
conductors

He
heard
those
around
him
disputing
in
whispers
and
one
of
them
insisting
that
he
should
be
led
along
a
certain
carpet

After
that
they
took
his
right
hand

placed
it
on
something

and
told
him
to
hold
a
pair
of
compasses
to
his
left
breast
with
the
other
hand
and
to
repeat
after
someone
who
read
aloud
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
laws
of
the
Order

The
candles
were
then
extinguished
and
some
spirit
lighted

as
Pierre
knew
by
the
smell

and
he
was
told
that
he
would
now
see
the
lesser
light

The
bandage
was
taken
off
his
eyes
and

by
the
faint
light
of
the
burning
spirit

Pierre

as
in
a
dream

saw
several
men
standing
before
him

wearing
aprons
like
the
Rhetor


s
and
holding
swords
in
their
hands
pointed
at
his
breast

Among
them
stood
a
man
whose
white
shirt
was
stained
with
blood

On
seeing
this

Pierre
moved
forward
with
his
breast
toward
the
swords

meaning
them
to
pierce
it

But
the
swords
were
drawn
back
from
him
and
he
was
at
once
blindfolded
again





Now
thou
hast
seen
the
lesser
light




uttered
a
voice

Then
the
candles
were
relit
and
he
was
told
that
he
would
see
the
full
light

the
bandage
was
again
removed
and
more
than
ten
voices
said
together




Sic
transit
gloria
mundi





Pierre
gradually
began
to
recover
himself
and
looked
about
at
the
room
and
at
the
people
in
it

Round
a
long
table
covered
with
black
sat
some
twelve
men
in
garments
like
those
he
had
already
seen

Some
of
them
Pierre
had
met
in
Petersburg
society

In
the
President


s
chair
sat
a
young
man
he
did
not
know

with
a
peculiar
cross
hanging
from
his
neck

On
his
right
sat
the
Italian
abb


whom
Pierre
had
met
at
Anna
P

vlovna


s
two
years
before

There
were
also
present
a
very
distinguished
dignitary
and
a
Swiss
who
had
formerly
been
tutor
at
the
Kur

gins




All
maintained
a
solemn
silence

listening
to
the
words
of
the
President

who
held
a
mallet
in
his
hand

Let
into
the
wall
was
a
star
shaped
light

At
one
side
of
the
table
was
a
small
carpet
with
various
figures
worked
upon
it

at
the
other
was
something
resembling
an
altar
on
which
lay
a
Testament
and
a
skull

Round
it
stood
seven
large
candlesticks
like
those
used
in
churches

Two
of
the
brothers
led
Pierre
up
to
the
altar

placed
his
feet
at
right
angles

and
bade
him
lie
down

saying
that
he
must
prostrate
himself
at
the
Gates
of
the
Temple





He
must
first
receive
the
trowel




whispered
one
of
the
brothers





Oh

hush

please




said
another


Pierre

perplexed

looked
round
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
without
obeying

and
suddenly
doubts
arose
in
his
mind




Where
am
I

What
am
I
doing

Aren


t
they
laughing
at
me

Shan


t
I
be
ashamed
to
remember
this




But
these
doubts
only
lasted
a
moment

Pierre
glanced
at
the
serious
faces
of
those
around

remembered
all
he
had
already
gone
through

and
realized
that
he
could
not
stop
halfway

He
was
aghast
at
his
hesitation
and

trying
to
arouse
his
former
devotional
feeling

prostrated
himself
before
the
Gates
of
the
Temple

And
really

the
feeling
of
devotion
returned
to
him
even
more
strongly
than
before

When
he
had
lain
there
some
time

he
was
told
to
get
up

and
a
white
leather
apron

such
as
the
others
wore

was
put
on
him

he
was
given
a
trowel
and
three
pairs
of
gloves

and
then
the
Grand
Master
addressed
him

He
told
him
that
he
should
try
to
do
nothing
to
stain
the
whiteness
of
that
apron

which
symbolized
strength
and
purity

then
of
the
unexplained
trowel

he
told
him
to
toil
with
it
to
cleanse
his
own
heart
from
vice

and
indulgently
to
smooth
with
it
the
heart
of
his
neighbor

As
to
the
first
pair
of
gloves

a
man


s

he
said
that
Pierre
could
not
know
their
meaning
but
must
keep
them

The
second
pair
of
man


s
gloves
he
was
to
wear
at
the
meetings

and
finally
of
the
third

a
pair
of
women


s
gloves

he
said




Dear
brother

these
woman


s
gloves
are
intended
for
you
too

Give
them
to
the
woman
whom
you
shall
honor
most
of
all

This
gift
will
be
a
pledge
of
your
purity
of
heart
to
her
whom
you
select
to
be
your
worthy
helpmeet
in
Masonry




And
after
a
pause

he
added




But
beware

dear
brother

that
these
gloves
do
not
deck
hands
that
are
unclean




While
the
Grand
Master
said
these
last
words
it
seemed
to
Pierre
that
he
grew
embarrassed

Pierre
himself
grew
still
more
confused

blushed
like
a
child
till
tears
came
to
his
eyes

began
looking
about
him
uneasily

and
an
awkward
pause
followed


This
silence
was
broken
by
one
of
the
brethren

who
led
Pierre
up
to
the
rug
and
began
reading
to
him
from
a
manuscript
book
an
explanation
of
all
the
figures
on
it

the
sun

the
moon

a
hammer

a
plumb
line

a
trowel

a
rough
stone
and
a
squared
stone

a
pillar

three
windows

and
so
on

Then
a
place
was
assigned
to
Pierre

he
was
shown
the
signs
of
the
Lodge

told
the
password

and
at
last
was
permitted
to
sit
down

The
Grand
Master
began
reading
the
statutes

They
were
very
long

and
Pierre

from
joy

agitation

and
embarrassment

was
not
in
a
state
to
understand
what
was
being
read

He
managed
to
follow
only
the
last
words
of
the
statutes
and
these
remained
in
his
mind





In
our
temples
we
recognize
no
other
distinctions




read
the
Grand
Master




but
those
between
virtue
and
vice

Beware
of
making
any
distinctions
which
may
infringe
equality

Fly
to
a
brother


s
aid
whoever
he
may
be

exhort
him
who
goeth
astray

raise
him
that
falleth

never
bear
malice
or
enmity
toward
thy
brother

Be
kindly
and
courteous

Kindle
in
all
hearts
the
flame
of
virtue

Share
thy
happiness
with
thy
neighbor

and
may
envy
never
dim
the
purity
of
that
bliss

Forgive
thy
enemy

do
not
avenge
thyself
except
by
doing
him
good

Thus
fulfilling
the
highest
law
thou
shalt
regain
traces
of
the
ancient
dignity
which
thou
hast
lost





He
finished
and

getting
up

embraced
and
kissed
Pierre

who

with
tears
of
joy
in
his
eyes

looked
round
him

not
knowing
how
to
answer
the
congratulations
and
greetings
from
acquaintances
that
met
him
on
all
sides

He
acknowledged
no
acquaintances
but
saw
in
all
these
men
only
brothers

and
burned
with
impatience
to
set
to
work
with
them


The
Grand
Master
rapped
with
his
mallet

All
the
Masons
sat
down
in
their
places

and
one
of
them
read
an
exhortation
on
the
necessity
of
humility


The
Grand
Master
proposed
that
the
last
duty
should
be
performed

and
the
distinguished
dignitary
who
bore
the
title
of



Collector
of
Alms



went
round
to
all
the
brothers

Pierre
would
have
liked
to
subscribe
all
he
had

but
fearing
that
it
might
look
like
pride
subscribed
the
same
amount
as
the
others


The
meeting
was
at
an
end

and
on
reaching
home
Pierre
felt
as
if
he
had
returned
from
a
long
journey
on
which
he
had
spent
dozens
of
years

had
become
completely
changed

and
had
quite
left
behind
his
former
habits
and
way
of
life






CHAPTER
V

The
day
after
he
had
been
received
into
the
Lodge

Pierre
was
sitting
at
home
reading
a
book
and
trying
to
fathom
the
significance
of
the
Square

one
side
of
which
symbolized
God

another
moral
things

a
third
physical
things

and
the
fourth
a
combination
of
these

Now
and
then
his
attention
wandered
from
the
book
and
the
Square
and
he
formed
in
imagination
a
new
plan
of
life

On
the
previous
evening
at
the
Lodge

he
had
heard
that
a
rumor
of
his
duel
had
reached
the
Emperor
and
that
it
would
be
wiser
for
him
to
leave
Petersburg

Pierre
proposed
going
to
his
estates
in
the
south
and
there
attending
to
the
welfare
of
his
serfs

He
was
joyfully
planning
this
new
life

when
Prince
Vas

li
suddenly
entered
the
room





My
dear
fellow

what
have
you
been
up
to
in
Moscow

Why
have
you
quarreled
with
H

l

ne

mon
cher

You
are
under
a
delusion




said
Prince
Vas

li

as
he
entered




I
know
all
about
it

and
I
can
tell
you
positively
that
H

l

ne
is
as
innocent
before
you
as
Christ
was
before
the
Jews





Pierre
was
about
to
reply

but
Prince
Vas

li
interrupted
him





And
why
didn


t
you
simply
come
straight
to
me
as
to
a
friend

I
know
all
about
it
and
understand
it
all




he
said




You
behaved
as
becomes
a
man
who
values
his
honor

perhaps
too
hastily

but
we
won


t
go
into
that

But
consider
the
position
in
which
you
are
placing
her
and
me
in
the
eyes
of
society

and
even
of
the
court




he
added

lowering
his
voice




She
is
living
in
Moscow
and
you
are
here

Remember

dear
boy




and
he
drew
Pierre


s
arm
downwards




it
is
simply
a
misunderstanding

I
expect
you
feel
it
so
yourself

Let
us
write
her
a
letter
at
once

and
she


ll
come
here
and
all
will
be
explained

or
else

my
dear
boy

let
me
tell
you
it


s
quite
likely
you


ll
have
to
suffer
for
it





Prince
Vas

li
gave
Pierre
a
significant
look





I
know
from
reliable
sources
that
the
Dowager
Empress
is
taking
a
keen
interest
in
the
whole
affair

You
know
she
is
very
gracious
to
H

l

ne





Pierre
tried
several
times
to
speak

but

on
one
hand

Prince
Vas

li
did
not
let
him
and

on
the
other

Pierre
himself
feared
to
begin
to
speak
in
the
tone
of
decided
refusal
and
disagreement
in
which
he
had
firmly
resolved
to
answer
his
father
in
law

Moreover

the
words
of
the
Masonic
statutes




be
kindly
and
courteous




recurred
to
him

He
blinked

went
red

got
up
and
sat
down
again

struggling
with
himself
to
do
what
was
for
him
the
most
difficult
thing
in
life


to
say
an
unpleasant
thing
to
a
man


s
face

to
say
what
the
other

whoever
he
might
be

did
not
expect

He
was
so
used
to
submitting
to
Prince
Vas

li


s
tone
of
careless
self
assurance
that
he
felt
he
would
be
unable
to
withstand
it
now

but
he
also
felt
that
on
what
he
said
now
his
future
depended


whether
he
would
follow
the
same
old
road

or
that
new
path
so
attractively
shown
him
by
the
Masons

on
which
he
firmly
believed
he
would
be
reborn
to
a
new
life





Now

dear
boy




said
Prince
Vas

li
playfully




say



yes




and
I


ll
write
to
her
myself

and
we
will
kill
the
fatted
calf





But
before
Prince
Vas

li
had
finished
his
playful
speech

Pierre

without
looking
at
him

and
with
a
kind
of
fury
that
made
him
like
his
father

muttered
in
a
whisper





Prince

I
did
not
ask
you
here

Go

please
go




And
he
jumped
up
and
opened
the
door
for
him





Go




he
repeated

amazed
at
himself
and
glad
to
see
the
look
of
confusion
and
fear
that
showed
itself
on
Prince
Vas

li


s
face





What


s
the
matter
with
you

Are
you
ill








Go




the
quivering
voice
repeated

And
Prince
Vas

li
had
to
go
without
receiving
any
explanation


A
week
later

Pierre

having
taken
leave
of
his
new
friends

the
Masons

and
leaving
large
sums
of
money
with
them
for
alms

went
away
to
his
estates

His
new
brethren
gave
him
letters
to
the
Kiev
and
Odessa
Masons
and
promised
to
write
to
him
and
guide
him
in
his
new
activity






CHAPTER
VI

The
duel
between
Pierre
and
D

lokhov
was
hushed
up
and

in
spite
of
the
Emperor


s
severity
regarding
duels
at
that
time

neither
the
principals
nor
their
seconds
suffered
for
it

But
the
story
of
the
duel

confirmed
by
Pierre


s
rupture
with
his
wife

was
the
talk
of
society

Pierre
who
had
been
regarded
with
patronizing
condescension
when
he
was
an
illegitimate
son

and
petted
and
extolled
when
he
was
the
best
match
in
Russia

had
sunk
greatly
in
the
esteem
of
society
after
his
marriage


when
the
marriageable
daughters
and
their
mothers
had
nothing
to
hope
from
him


especially
as
he
did
not
know
how

and
did
not
wish

to
court
society


s
favor

Now
he
alone
was
blamed
for
what
had
happened

he
was
said
to
be
insanely
jealous
and
subject
like
his
father
to
fits
of
bloodthirsty
rage

And
when
after
Pierre


s
departure
H

l

ne
returned
to
Petersburg

she
was
received
by
all
her
acquaintances
not
only
cordially

but
even
with
a
shade
of
deference
due
to
her
misfortune

When
conversation
turned
on
her
husband
H

l

ne
assumed
a
dignified
expression

which
with
characteristic
tact
she
had
acquired
though
she
did
not
understand
its
significance

This
expression
suggested
that
she
had
resolved
to
endure
her
troubles
uncomplainingly
and
that
her
husband
was
a
cross
laid
upon
her
by
God

Prince
Vas

li
expressed
his
opinion
more
openly

He
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
Pierre
was
mentioned
and

pointing
to
his
forehead

remarked





A
bit
touched


I
always
said
so








I
said
from
the
first




declared
Anna
P

vlovna
referring
to
Pierre




I
said
at
the
time
and
before
anyone
else




she
insisted
on
her
priority




that
that
senseless
young
man
was
spoiled
by
the
depraved
ideas
of
these
days

I
said
so
even
at
the
time
when
everybody
was
in
raptures
about
him

when
he
had
just
returned
from
abroad

and
when

if
you
remember

he
posed
as
a
sort
of
Marat
at
one
of
my
soirees

And
how
has
it
ended

I
was
against
this
marriage
even
then
and
foretold
all
that
has
happened





Anna
P

vlovna
continued
to
give
on
free
evenings
the
same
kind
of
soirees
as
before


such
as
she
alone
had
the
gift
of
arranging


at
which
was
to
be
found



the
cream
of
really
good
society

the
bloom
of
the
intellectual
essence
of
Petersburg




as
she
herself
put
it

Besides
this
refined
selection
of
society
Anna
P

vlovna


s
receptions
were
also
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
she
always
presented
some
new
and
interesting
person
to
the
visitors
and
that
nowhere
else
was
the
state
of
the
political
thermometer
of
legitimate
Petersburg
court
society
so
dearly
and
distinctly
indicated


Toward
the
end
of






when
all
the
sad
details
of
Napoleon


s
destruction
of
the
Prussian
army
at
Jena
and
Auerst

dt
and
the
surrender
of
most
of
the
Prussian
fortresses
had
been
received

when
our
troops
had
already
entered
Prussia
and
our
second
war
with
Napoleon
was
beginning

Anna
P

vlovna
gave
one
of
her
soirees

The



cream
of
really
good
society



consisted
of
the
fascinating
H

l

ne

forsaken
by
her
husband

Mortemart

the
delightful
Prince
Hippolyte
who
had
just
returned
from
Vienna

two
diplomatists

the
old
aunt

a
young
man
referred
to
in
that
drawing
room
as



a
man
of
great
merit




un
homme
de
beaucoup
de
m

rite


a
newly
appointed
maid
of
honor
and
her
mother

and
several
other
less
noteworthy
persons


The
novelty
Anna
P

vlovna
was
setting
before
her
guests
that
evening
was
Bor

s
Drubetsk

y

who
had
just
arrived
as
a
special
messenger
from
the
Prussian
army
and
was
aide
de
camp
to
a
very
important
personage


The
temperature
shown
by
the
political
thermometer
to
the
company
that
evening
was
this





Whatever
the
European
sovereigns
and
commanders
may
do
to
countenance
Bonaparte

and
to
cause
me

and
us
in
general

annoyance
and
mortification

our
opinion
of
Bonaparte
cannot
alter

We
shall
not
cease
to
express
our
sincere
views
on
that
subject

and
can
only
say
to
the
King
of
Prussia
and
others




So
much
the
worse
for
you

Tu
l


as
voulu

George
Dandin




that


s
all
we
have
to
say
about
it





When
Bor

s

who
was
to
be
served
up
to
the
guests

entered
the
drawing
room

almost
all
the
company
had
assembled

and
the
conversation

guided
by
Anna
P

vlovna

was
about
our
diplomatic
relations
with
Austria
and
the
hope
of
an
alliance
with
her


Bor

s

grown
more
manly
and
looking
fresh

rosy
and
self
possessed

entered
the
drawing
room
elegantly
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
an
aide
de
camp
and
was
duly
conducted
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
aunt
and
then
brought
back
to
the
general
circle


Anna
P

vlovna
gave
him
her
shriveled
hand
to
kiss
and
introduced
him
to
several
persons
whom
he
did
not
know

giving
him
a
whispered
description
of
each





Prince

young
fellow

d


affaires
from
Copenhagen


a
profound
intellect




and
simply




Mr

Sh

tov


a
man
of
great
merit





this
of
the
man
usually
so
described


Thanks
to
Anna
Mikh

ylovna


s
efforts

his
own
tastes

and
the
peculiarities
of
his
reserved
nature

Bor

s
had
managed
during
his
service
to
place
himself
very
advantageously

He
was
aide
de
camp
to
a
very
important
personage

had
been
sent
on
a
very
important
mission
to
Prussia

and
had
just
returned
from
there
as
a
special
messenger

He
had
become
thoroughly
conversant
with
that
unwritten
code
with
which
he
had
been
so
pleased
at
Olm

tz
and
according
to
which
an
ensign
might
rank
incomparably
higher
than
a
general

and
according
to
which
what
was
needed
for
success
in
the
service
was
not
effort
or
work

or
courage

or
perseverance

but
only
the
knowledge
of
how
to
get
on
with
those
who
can
grant
rewards

and
he
was
himself
often
surprised
at
the
rapidity
of
his
success
and
at
the
inability
of
others
to
understand
these
things

In
consequence
of
this
discovery
his
whole
manner
of
life

all
his
relations
with
old
friends

all
his
plans
for
his
future

were
completely
altered

He
was
not
rich

but
would
spend
his
last
groat
to
be
better
dressed
than
others

and
would
rather
deprive
himself
of
many
pleasures
than
allow
himself
to
be
seen
in
a
shabby
equipage
or
appear
in
the
streets
of
Petersburg
in
an
old
uniform

He
made
friends
with
and
sought
the
acquaintance
of
only
those
above
him
in
position
and
who
could
therefore
be
of
use
to
him

He
liked
Petersburg
and
despised
Moscow

The
remembrance
of
the
Rost

vs



house
and
of
his
childish
love
for
Nat

sha
was
unpleasant
to
him
and
he
had
not
once
been
to
see
the
Rost

vs
since
the
day
of
his
departure
for
the
army

To
be
in
Anna
P

vlovna


s
drawing
room
he
considered
an
important
step
up
in
the
service

and
he
at
once
understood
his
role

letting
his
hostess
make
use
of
whatever
interest
he
had
to
offer

He
himself
carefully
scanned
each
face

appraising
the
possibilities
of
establishing
intimacy
with
each
of
those
present

and
the
advantages
that
might
accrue

He
took
the
seat
indicated
to
him
beside
the
fair
H

l

ne
and
listened
to
the
general
conversation





Vienna
considers
the
bases
of
the
proposed
treaty
so
unattainable
that
not
even
a
continuity
of
most
brilliant
successes
would
secure
them

and
she
doubts
the
means
we
have
of
gaining
them

That
is
the
actual
phrase
used
by
the
Vienna
cabinet




said
the
Danish
charg


d

The
doubt
is
flattering




said



the
man
of
profound
intellect




with
a
subtle
smile





We
must
distinguish
between
the
Vienna
cabinet
and
the
Emperor
of
Austria




said
Mortemart




The
Emperor
of
Austria
can
never
have
thought
of
such
a
thing

it
is
only
the
cabinet
that
says
it








Ah

my
dear
vicomte




put
in
Anna
P

vlovna




L


Urope




for
some
reason
she
called
it
Urope
as
if
that
were
a
specially
refined
French
pronunciation
which
she
could
allow
herself
when
conversing
with
a
Frenchman





L


Urope
ne
sera
jamais
notre
alli

e
sinc

re
















Europe
will
never
be
our
sincere
ally






After
that
Anna
P

vlovna
led
up
to
the
courage
and
firmness
of
the
King
of
Prussia

in
order
to
draw
Bor

s
into
the
conversation


Bor

s
listened
attentively
to
each
of
the
speakers

awaiting
his
turn

but
managed
meanwhile
to
look
round
repeatedly
at
his
neighbor

the
beautiful
H

l

ne

whose
eyes
several
times
met
those
of
the
handsome
young
aide
de
camp
with
a
smile


Speaking
of
the
position
of
Prussia

Anna
P

vlovna
very
naturally
asked
Bor

s
to
tell
them
about
his
journey
to
Glogau
and
in
what
state
he
found
the
Prussian
army

Bor

s

speaking
with
deliberation

told
them
in
pure

correct
French
many
interesting
details
about
the
armies
and
the
court

carefully
abstaining
from
expressing
an
opinion
of
his
own
about
the
facts
he
was
recounting

For
some
time
he
engrossed
the
general
attention

and
Anna
P

vlovna
felt
that
the
novelty
she
had
served
up
was
received
with
pleasure
by
all
her
visitors

The
greatest
attention
of
all
to
Bor

s



narrative
was
shown
by
H

l

ne

She
asked
him
several
questions
about
his
journey
and
seemed
greatly
interested
in
the
state
of
the
Prussian
army

As
soon
as
he
had
finished
she
turned
to
him
with
her
usual
smile





You
absolutely
must
come
and
see
me




she
said
in
a
tone
that
implied
that

for
certain
considerations
he
could
not
know
of

this
was
absolutely
necessary





On
Tuesday
between
eight
and
nine

It
will
give
me
great
pleasure





Bor

s
promised
to
fulfill
her
wish
and
was
about
to
begin
a
conversation
with
her

when
Anna
P

vlovna
called
him
away
on
the
pretext
that
her
aunt
wished
to
hear
him





You
know
her
husband

of
course




said
Anna
P

vlovna

closing
her
eyes
and
indicating
H

l

ne
with
a
sorrowful
gesture




Ah

she
is
such
an
unfortunate
and
charming
woman

Don


t
mention
him
before
her


please
don


t

It
is
too
painful
for
her









CHAPTER
VII

When
Bor

s
and
Anna
P

vlovna
returned
to
the
others
Prince
Hippolyte
had
the
ear
of
the
company


Bending
forward
in
his
armchair
he
said




Le
Roi
de
Prusse




and
having
said
this
laughed

Everyone
turned
toward
him





Le
Roi
de
Prusse




Hippolyte
said
interrogatively

again
laughing

and
then
calmly
and
seriously
sat
back
in
his
chair

Anna
P

vlovna
waited
for
him
to
go
on

but
as
he
seemed
quite
decided
to
say
no
more
she
began
to
tell
of
how
at
Potsdam
the
impious
Bonaparte
had
stolen
the
sword
of
Frederick
the
Great





It
is
the
sword
of
Frederick
the
Great
which
I






she
began

but
Hippolyte
interrupted
her
with
the
words




Le
Roi
de
Prusse






and
again

as
soon
as
all
turned
toward
him

excused
himself
and
said
no
more


Anna
P

vlovna
frowned

Mortemart

Hippolyte


s
friend

addressed
him
firmly





Come
now

what
about
your
Roi
de
Prusse





Hippolyte
laughed
as
if
ashamed
of
laughing





Oh

it


s
nothing

I
only
wished
to
say







he
wanted
to
repeat
a
joke
he
had
heard
in
Vienna
and
which
he
had
been
trying
all
that
evening
to
get
in




I
only
wished
to
say
that
we
are
wrong
to
fight
pour
le
Roi
de
Prusse





Bor

s
smiled
circumspectly

so
that
it
might
be
taken
as
ironical
or
appreciative
according
to
the
way
the
joke
was
received

Everybody
laughed





Your
joke
is
too
bad

it


s
witty
but
unjust




said
Anna
P

vlovna

shaking
her
little
shriveled
finger
at
him





We
are
not
fighting
pour
le
Roi
de
Prusse

but
for
right
principles

Oh

that
wicked
Prince
Hippolyte




she
said


The
conversation
did
not
flag
all
evening
and
turned
chiefly
on
the
political
news

It
became
particularly
animated
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
when
the
rewards
bestowed
by
the
Emperor
were
mentioned





You
know
N



N



received
a
snuffbox
with
the
portrait
last
year




said



the
man
of
profound
intellect







Why
shouldn


t
S



S



get
the
same
distinction








Pardon
me

A
snuffbox
with
the
Emperor


s
portrait
is
a
reward
but
not
a
distinction




said
the
diplomatist





a
gift

rather








There
are
precedents

I
may
mention
Schwarzenberg








It


s
impossible




replied
another





Will
you
bet

The
ribbon
of
the
order
is
a
different
matter








When
everybody
rose
to
go

H

l

ne
who
had
spoken
very
little
all
the
evening
again
turned
to
Bor

s

asking
him
in
a
tone
of
caressing
significant
command
to
come
to
her
on
Tuesday





It
is
of
great
importance
to
me




she
said

turning
with
a
smile
toward
Anna
P

vlovna

and
Anna
P

vlovna

with
the
same
sad
smile
with
which
she
spoke
of
her
exalted
patroness

supported
H

l

ne


s
wish


It
seemed
as
if
from
some
words
Bor

s
had
spoken
that
evening
about
the
Prussian
army

H

l

ne
had
suddenly
found
it
necessary
to
see
him

She
seemed
to
promise
to
explain
that
necessity
to
him
when
he
came
on
Tuesday


But
on
Tuesday
evening

having
come
to
H

l

ne


s
splendid
salon

Bor

s
received
no
clear
explanation
of
why
it
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
come

There
were
other
guests
and
the
countess
talked
little
to
him

and
only
as
he
kissed
her
hand
on
taking
leave
said
unexpectedly
and
in
a
whisper

with
a
strangely
unsmiling
face




Come
to
dinner
tomorrow



in
the
evening

You
must
come




Come





During
that
stay
in
Petersburg

Bor

s
became
an
intimate
in
the
countess



house






CHAPTER
VIII

The
war
was
flaming
up
and
nearing
the
Russian
frontier

Everywhere
one
heard
curses
on
Bonaparte




the
enemy
of
mankind




Militiamen
and
recruits
were
being
enrolled
in
the
villages

and
from
the
seat
of
war
came
contradictory
news

false
as
usual
and
therefore
variously
interpreted

The
life
of
old
Prince
Bolk

nski

Prince
Andrew

and
Princess
Mary
had
greatly
changed
since







In





the
old
prince
was
made
one
of
the
eight
commanders
in
chief
then
appointed
to
supervise
the
enrollment
decreed
throughout
Russia

Despite
the
weakness
of
age

which
had
become
particularly
noticeable
since
the
time
when
he
thought
his
son
had
been
killed

he
did
not
think
it
right
to
refuse
a
duty
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
by
the
Emperor
himself

and
this
fresh
opportunity
for
action
gave
him
new
energy
and
strength

He
was
continually
traveling
through
the
three
provinces
entrusted
to
him

was
pedantic
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
duties

severe
to
cruel
with
his
subordinates

and
went
into
everything
down
to
the
minutest
details
himself

Princess
Mary
had
ceased
taking
lessons
in
mathematics
from
her
father

and
when
the
old
prince
was
at
home
went
to
his
study
with
the
wet
nurse
and
little
Prince
Nicholas

as
his
grandfather
called
him


The
baby
Prince
Nicholas
lived
with
his
wet
nurse
and
nurse
S

vishna
in
the
late
princess



rooms
and
Princess
Mary
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
nursery

taking
a
mother


s
place
to
her
little
nephew
as
best
she
could

Mademoiselle
Bourienne

too

seemed
passionately
fond
of
the
boy

and
Princess
Mary
often
deprived
herself
to
give
her
friend
the
pleasure
of
dandling
the
little
angel


as
she
called
her
nephew


and
playing
with
him


Near
the
altar
of
the
church
at
Bald
Hills
there
was
a
chapel
over
the
tomb
of
the
little
princess

and
in
this
chapel
was
a
marble
monument
brought
from
Italy

representing
an
angel
with
outspread
wings
ready
to
fly
upwards

The
angel


s
upper
lip
was
slightly
raised
as
though
about
to
smile

and
once
on
coming
out
of
the
chapel
Prince
Andrew
and
Princess
Mary
admitted
to
one
another
that
the
angel


s
face
reminded
them
strangely
of
the
little
princess

But
what
was
still
stranger

though
of
this
Prince
Andrew
said
nothing
to
his
sister

was
that
in
the
expression
the
sculptor
had
happened
to
give
the
angel


s
face

Prince
Andrew
read
the
same
mild
reproach
he
had
read
on
the
face
of
his
dead
wife




Ah

why
have
you
done
this
to
me





Soon
after
Prince
Andrew


s
return
the
old
prince
made
over
to
him
a
large
estate

Boguch

rovo

about
twenty
five
miles
from
Bald
Hills

Partly
because
of
the
depressing
memories
associated
with
Bald
Hills

partly
because
Prince
Andrew
did
not
always
feel
equal
to
bearing
with
his
father


s
peculiarities

and
partly
because
he
needed
solitude

Prince
Andrew
made
use
of
Boguch

rovo

began
building
and
spent
most
of
his
time
there


After
the
Austerlitz
campaign
Prince
Andrew
had
firmly
resolved
not
to
continue
his
military
service

and
when
the
war
recommenced
and
everybody
had
to
serve

he
took
a
post
under
his
father
in
the
recruitment
so
as
to
avoid
active
service

The
old
prince
and
his
son
seemed
to
have
changed
roles
since
the
campaign
of






The
old
man

roused
by
activity

expected
the
best
results
from
the
new
campaign

while
Prince
Andrew
on
the
contrary

taking
no
part
in
the
war
and
secretly
regretting
this

saw
only
the
dark
side


On
February










the
old
prince
set
off
on
one
of
his
circuits

Prince
Andrew
remained
at
Bald
Hills
as
usual
during
his
father


s
absence

Little
Nicholas
had
been
unwell
for
four
days

The
coachman
who
had
driven
the
old
prince
to
town
returned
bringing
papers
and
letters
for
Prince
Andrew


Not
finding
the
young
prince
in
his
study
the
valet
went
with
the
letters
to
Princess
Mary


s
apartments

but
did
not
find
him
there

He
was
told
that
the
prince
had
gone
to
the
nursery





If
you
please

your
excellency

P

trusha
has
brought
some
papers




said
one
of
the
nursemaids
to
Prince
Andrew
who
was
sitting
on
a
child


s
little
chair
while

frowning
and
with
trembling
hands

he
poured
drops
from
a
medicine
bottle
into
a
wineglass
half
full
of
water





What
is
it




he
said
crossly

and

his
hand
shaking
unintentionally

he
poured
too
many
drops
into
the
glass

He
threw
the
mixture
onto
the
floor
and
asked
for
some
more
water

The
maid
brought
it


There
were
in
the
room
a
child


s
cot

two
boxes

two
armchairs

a
table

a
child


s
table

and
the
little
chair
on
which
Prince
Andrew
was
sitting

The
curtains
were
drawn

and
a
single
candle
was
burning
on
the
table

screened
by
a
bound
music
book
so
that
the
light
did
not
fall
on
the
cot





My
dear




said
Princess
Mary

addressing
her
brother
from
beside
the
cot
where
she
was
standing




better
wait
a
bit



later










Oh

leave
off

you
always
talk
nonsense
and
keep
putting
things
off


and
this
is
what
comes
of
it




said
Prince
Andrew
in
an
exasperated
whisper

evidently
meaning
to
wound
his
sister





My
dear

really



it


s
better
not
to
wake
him



he


s
asleep




said
the
princess
in
a
tone
of
entreaty


Prince
Andrew
got
up
and
went
on
tiptoe
up
to
the
little
bed

wineglass
in
hand





Perhaps
we


d
really
better
not
wake
him




he
said
hesitating





As
you
please



really



I
think
so



but
as
you
please




said
Princess
Mary

evidently
intimidated
and
confused
that
her
opinion
had
prevailed

She
drew
her
brother


s
attention
to
the
maid
who
was
calling
him
in
a
whisper


It
was
the
second
night
that
neither
of
them
had
slept

watching
the
boy
who
was
in
a
high
fever

These
last
days

mistrusting
their
household
doctor
and
expecting
another
for
whom
they
had
sent
to
town

they
had
been
trying
first
one
remedy
and
then
another

Worn
out
by
sleeplessness
and
anxiety
they
threw
their
burden
of
sorrow
on
one
another
and
reproached
and
disputed
with
each
other





P

trusha
has
come
with
papers
from
your
father




whispered
the
maid


Prince
Andrew
went
out





Devil
take
them




he
muttered

and
after
listening
to
the
verbal
instructions
his
father
had
sent
and
taking
the
correspondence
and
his
father


s
letter

he
returned
to
the
nursery





Well




he
asked





Still
the
same

Wait

for
heaven


s
sake

Karl
Iv

nich
always
says
that
sleep
is
more
important
than
anything




whispered
Princess
Mary
with
a
sigh


Prince
Andrew
went
up
to
the
child
and
felt
him

He
was
burning
hot





Confound
you
and
your
Karl
Iv

nich




He
took
the
glass
with
the
drops
and
again
went
up
to
the
cot





Andrew

don


t




said
Princess
Mary


But
he
scowled
at
her
angrily
though
also
with
suffering
in
his
eyes

and
stooped
glass
in
hand
over
the
infant





But
I
wish
it




he
said




I
beg
you


give
it
him





Princess
Mary
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
took
the
glass
submissively
and
calling
the
nurse
began
giving
the
medicine

The
child
screamed
hoarsely

Prince
Andrew
winced
and

clutching
his
head

went
out
and
sat
down
on
a
sofa
in
the
next
room


He
still
had
all
the
letters
in
his
hand

Opening
them
mechanically
he
began
reading

The
old
prince

now
and
then
using
abbreviations

wrote
in
his
large
elongated
hand
on
blue
paper
as
follows


Have
just
this
moment
received
by
special
messenger
very
joyful
news


if
it


s
not
false

Bennigsen
seems
to
have
obtained
a
complete
victory
over
Buonaparte
at
Eylau

In
Petersburg
everyone
is
rejoicing

and
the
rewards
sent
to
the
army
are
innumerable

Though
he
is
a
German


I
congratulate
him

I
can


t
make
out
what
the
commander
at
K

rchevo


a
certain
Khandrik

v


is
up
to

till
now
the
additional
men
and
provisions
have
not
arrived

Gallop
off
to
him
at
once
and
say
I


ll
have
his
head
off
if
everything
is
not
here
in
a
week

Have
received
another
letter
about
the
Preussisch
Eylau
battle
from
P

tenka


he
took
part
in
it


and
it


s
all
true

When
mischief
makers
don


t
meddle
even
a
German
beats
Buonaparte

He
is
said
to
be
fleeing
in
great
disorder

Mind
you
gallop
off
to
K

rchevo
without
delay
and
carry
out
instructions


Prince
Andrew
sighed
and
broke
the
seal
of
another
envelope

It
was
a
closely
written
letter
of
two
sheets
from
Bil

bin

He
folded
it
up
without
reading
it
and
reread
his
father


s
letter

ending
with
the
words




Gallop
off
to
K

rchevo
and
carry
out
instructions








No

pardon
me

I
won


t
go
now
till
the
child
is
better




thought
he

going
to
the
door
and
looking
into
the
nursery


Princess
Mary
was
still
standing
by
the
cot

gently
rocking
the
baby





Ah
yes

and
what
else
did
he
say
that


s
unpleasant




thought
Prince
Andrew

recalling
his
father


s
letter




Yes

we
have
gained
a
victory
over
Bonaparte

just
when
I


m
not
serving

Yes

yes

he


s
always
poking
fun
at
me




Ah

well

Let
him




And
he
began
reading
Bil

bin


s
letter
which
was
written
in
French

He
read
without
understanding
half
of
it

read
only
to
forget

if
but
for
a
moment

what
he
had
too
long
been
thinking
of
so
painfully
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else






CHAPTER
IX

Bil

bin
was
now
at
army
headquarters
in
a
diplomatic
capacity

and
though
he
wrote
in
French
and
used
French
jests
and
French
idioms

he
described
the
whole
campaign
with
a
fearless
self
censure
and
self
derision
genuinely
Russian

Bil

bin
wrote
that
the
obligation
of
diplomatic
discretion
tormented
him

and
he
was
happy
to
have
in
Prince
Andrew
a
reliable
correspondent
to
whom
he
could
pour
out
the
bile
he
had
accumulated
at
the
sight
of
all
that
was
being
done
in
the
army

The
letter
was
old

having
been
written
before
the
battle
at
Preussisch
Eylau





Since
the
day
of
our
brilliant
success
at
Austerlitz




wrote
Bil

bin




as
you
know

my
dear
prince

I
never
leave
headquarters

I
have
certainly
acquired
a
taste
for
war

and
it
is
just
as
well
for
me

what
I
have
seen
during
these
last
three
months
is
incredible





I
begin
ab
ovo




The
enemy
of
the
human
race




as
you
know

attacks
the
Prussians

The
Prussians
are
our
faithful
allies
who
have
only
betrayed
us
three
times
in
three
years

We
take
up
their
cause

but
it
turns
out
that



the
enemy
of
the
human
race



pays
no
heed
to
our
fine
speeches
and
in
his
rude
and
savage
way
throws
himself
on
the
Prussians
without
giving
them
time
to
finish
the
parade
they
had
begun

and
in
two
twists
of
the
hand
he
breaks
them
to
smithereens
and
installs
himself
in
the
palace
at
Potsdam








I
most
ardently
desire




writes
the
King
of
Prussia
to
Bonaparte




that
Your
Majesty
should
be
received
and
treated
in
my
palace
in
a
manner
agreeable
to
yourself

and
in
so
far
as
circumstances
allowed

I
have
hastened
to
take
all
steps
to
that
end

May
I
have
succeeded




The
Prussian
generals
pride
themselves
on
being
polite
to
the
French
and
lay
down
their
arms
at
the
first
demand





The
head
of
the
garrison
at
Glogau

with
ten
thousand
men

asks
the
King
of
Prussia
what
he
is
to
do
if
he
is
summoned
to
surrender




All
this
is
absolutely
true





In
short

hoping
to
settle
matters
by
taking
up
a
warlike
attitude

it
turns
out
that
we
have
landed
ourselves
in
war

and
what
is
more

in
war
on
our
own
frontiers

with
and
for
the
King
of
Prussia

We
have
everything
in
perfect
order

only
one
little
thing
is
lacking

namely

a
commander
in
chief

As
it
was
considered
that
the
Austerlitz
success
might
have
been
more
decisive
had
the
commander
in
chief
not
been
so
young

all
our
octogenarians
were
reviewed

and
of
Prozor

vski
and
K

menski
the
latter
was
preferred

The
general
comes
to
us

Suv

rov
like

in
a
kib

tka

and
is
received
with
acclamations
of
joy
and
triumph





On
the

th

the
first
courier
arrives
from
Petersburg

The
mails
are
taken
to
the
field
marshal


s
room

for
he
likes
to
do
everything
himself

I
am
called
in
to
help
sort
the
letters
and
take
those
meant
for
us

The
field
marshal
looks
on
and
waits
for
letters
addressed
to
him

We
search

but
none
are
to
be
found

The
field
marshal
grows
impatient
and
sets
to
work
himself
and
finds
letters
from
the
Emperor
to
Count
T


Prince
V


and
others

Then
he
bursts
into
one
of
his
wild
furies
and
rages
at
everyone
and
everything

seizes
the
letters

opens
them

and
reads
those
from
the
Emperor
addressed
to
others




Ah

So
that


s
the
way
they
treat
me

No
confidence
in
me

Ah

ordered
to
keep
an
eye
on
me

Very
well
then

Get
along
with
you




So
he
writes
the
famous
order
of
the
day
to
General
Bennigsen








I
am
wounded
and
cannot
ride
and
consequently
cannot
command
the
army

You
have
brought
your
army
corps
to
Pult

sk

routed

here
it
is
exposed

and
without
fuel
or
forage

so
something
must
be
done

and

as
you
yourself
reported
to
Count
Buxh

wden
yesterday

you
must
think
of
retreating
to
our
frontier


which
do
today











From
all
my
riding




he
writes
to
the
Emperor




I
have
got
a
saddle
sore
which

coming
after
all
my
previous
journeys

quite
prevents
my
riding
and
commanding
so
vast
an
army

so
I
have
passed
on
the
command
to
the
general
next
in
seniority

Count
Buxh

wden

having
sent
him
my
whole
staff
and
all
that
belongs
to
it

advising
him
if
there
is
a
lack
of
bread

to
move
farther
into
the
interior
of
Prussia

for
only
one
day


s
ration
of
bread
remains

and
in
some
regiments
none
at
all

as
reported
by
the
division
commanders

Ostermann
and
Sedmor

tzki

and
all
that
the
peasants
had
has
been
eaten
up

I
myself
will
remain
in
hospital
at
Ostrolenka
till
I
recover

In
regard
to
which
I
humbly
submit
my
report

with
the
information
that
if
the
army
remains
in
its
present
bivouac
another
fortnight
there
will
not
be
a
healthy
man
left
in
it
by
spring








Grant
leave
to
retire
to
his
country
seat
to
an
old
man
who
is
already
in
any
case
dishonored
by
being
unable
to
fulfill
the
great
and
glorious
task
for
which
he
was
chosen

I
shall
await
your
most
gracious
permission
here
in
hospital

that
I
may
not
have
to
play
the
part
of
a
secretary
rather
than
commander
in
the
army

My
removal
from
the
army
does
not
produce
the
slightest
stir


a
blind
man
has
left
it

There
are
thousands
such
as
I
in
Russia








The
field
marshal
is
angry
with
the
Emperor
and
he
punishes
us
all

isn


t
it
logical





This
is
the
first
act

Those
that
follow
are
naturally
increasingly
interesting
and
entertaining

After
the
field
marshal


s
departure
it
appears
that
we
are
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
must
give
battle

Buxh

wden
is
commander
in
chief
by
seniority

but
General
Bennigsen
does
not
quite
see
it

more
particularly
as
it
is
he
and
his
corps
who
are
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
he
wishes
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
to
fight
a
battle



on
his
own
hand



as
the
Germans
say

He
does
so

This
is
the
battle
of
Pult

sk

which
is
considered
a
great
victory
but
in
my
opinion
was
nothing
of
the
kind

We
civilians

as
you
know

have
a
very
bad
way
of
deciding
whether
a
battle
was
won
or
lost

Those
who
retreat
after
a
battle
have
lost
it
is
what
we
say

and
according
to
that
it
is
we
who
lost
the
battle
of
Pult

sk

In
short

we
retreat
after
the
battle
but
send
a
courier
to
Petersburg
with
news
of
a
victory

and
General
Bennigsen

hoping
to
receive
from
Petersburg
the
post
of
commander
in
chief
as
a
reward
for
his
victory

does
not
give
up
the
command
of
the
army
to
General
Buxh

wden

During
this
interregnum
we
begin
a
very
original
and
interesting
series
of
maneuvers

Our
aim
is
no
longer

as
it
should
be

to
avoid
or
attack
the
enemy

but
solely
to
avoid
General
Buxh

wden
who
by
right
of
seniority
should
be
our
chief

So
energetically
do
we
pursue
this
aim
that
after
crossing
an
unfordable
river
we
burn
the
bridges
to
separate
ourselves
from
our
enemy

who
at
the
moment
is
not
Bonaparte
but
Buxh

wden

General
Buxh

wden
was
all
but
attacked
and
captured
by
a
superior
enemy
force
as
a
result
of
one
of
these
maneuvers
that
enabled
us
to
escape
him

Buxh

wden
pursues
us


we
scuttle

He
hardly
crosses
the
river
to
our
side
before
we
recross
to
the
other

At
last
our
enemy

Buxh

wden

catches
us
and
attacks

Both
generals
are
angry

and
the
result
is
a
challenge
on
Buxh

wden


s
part
and
an
epileptic
fit
on
Bennigsen


s

But
at
the
critical
moment
the
courier
who
carried
the
news
of
our
victory
at
Pult

sk
to
Petersburg
returns
bringing
our
appointment
as
commander
in
chief

and
our
first
foe

Buxh

wden

is
vanquished

we
can
now
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
second

Bonaparte

But
as
it
turns
out

just
at
that
moment
a
third
enemy
rises
before
us


namely
the
Orthodox
Russian
soldiers

loudly
demanding
bread

meat

biscuits

fodder

and
whatnot

The
stores
are
empty

the
roads
impassable

The
Orthodox
begin
looting

and
in
a
way
of
which
our
last
campaign
can
give
you
no
idea

Half
the
regiments
form
bands
and
scour
the
countryside
and
put
everything
to
fire
and
sword

The
inhabitants
are
totally
ruined

the
hospitals
overflow
with
sick

and
famine
is
everywhere

Twice
the
marauders
even
attack
our
headquarters

and
the
commander
in
chief
has
to
ask
for
a
battalion
to
disperse
them

During
one
of
these
attacks
they
carried
off
my
empty
portmanteau
and
my
dressing
gown

The
Emperor
proposes
to
give
all
commanders
of
divisions
the
right
to
shoot
marauders

but
I
much
fear
this
will
oblige
one
half
the
army
to
shoot
the
other





At
first
Prince
Andrew
read
with
his
eyes
only

but
after
a
while

in
spite
of
himself

although
he
knew
how
far
it
was
safe
to
trust
Bil

bin


what
he
had
read
began
to
interest
him
more
and
more

When
he
had
read
thus
far

he
crumpled
the
letter
up
and
threw
it
away

It
was
not
what
he
had
read
that
vexed
him

but
the
fact
that
the
life
out
there
in
which
he
had
now
no
part
could
perturb
him

He
shut
his
eyes

rubbed
his
forehead
as
if
to
rid
himself
of
all
interest
in
what
he
had
read

and
listened
to
what
was
passing
in
the
nursery

Suddenly
he
thought
he
heard
a
strange
noise
through
the
door

He
was
seized
with
alarm
lest
something
should
have
happened
to
the
child
while
he
was
reading
the
letter

He
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
nursery
door
and
opened
it


Just
as
he
went
in
he
saw
that
the
nurse
was
hiding
something
from
him
with
a
scared
look
and
that
Princess
Mary
was
no
longer
by
the
cot





My
dear




he
heard
what
seemed
to
him
her
despairing
whisper
behind
him


As
often
happens
after
long
sleeplessness
and
long
anxiety

he
was
seized
by
an
unreasoning
panic


it
occurred
to
him
that
the
child
was
dead

All
that
he
saw
and
heard
seemed
to
confirm
this
terror





All
is
over




he
thought

and
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead

He
went
to
the
cot
in
confusion

sure
that
he
would
find
it
empty
and
that
the
nurse
had
been
hiding
the
dead
baby

He
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
for
some
time
his
frightened

restless
eyes
could
not
find
the
baby

At
last
he
saw
him

the
rosy
boy
had
tossed
about
till
he
lay
across
the
bed
with
his
head
lower
than
the
pillow

and
was
smacking
his
lips
in
his
sleep
and
breathing
evenly


Prince
Andrew
was
as
glad
to
find
the
boy
like
that

as
if
he
had
already
lost
him

He
bent
over
him
and

as
his
sister
had
taught
him

tried
with
his
lips
whether
the
child
was
still
feverish

The
soft
forehead
was
moist

Prince
Andrew
touched
the
head
with
his
hand

even
the
hair
was
wet

so
profusely
had
the
child
perspired

He
was
not
dead

but
evidently
the
crisis
was
over
and
he
was
convalescent

Prince
Andrew
longed
to
snatch
up

to
squeeze

to
hold
to
his
heart

this
helpless
little
creature

but
dared
not
do
so

He
stood
over
him

gazing
at
his
head
and
at
the
little
arms
and
legs
which
showed
under
the
blanket

He
heard
a
rustle
behind
him
and
a
shadow
appeared
under
the
curtain
of
the
cot

He
did
not
look
round

but
still
gazing
at
the
infant


s
face
listened
to
his
regular
breathing

The
dark
shadow
was
Princess
Mary

who
had
come
up
to
the
cot
with
noiseless
steps

lifted
the
curtain

and
dropped
it
again
behind
her

Prince
Andrew
recognized
her
without
looking
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her

She
pressed
it





He
has
perspired




said
Prince
Andrew





I
was
coming
to
tell
you
so





The
child
moved
slightly
in
his
sleep

smiled

and
rubbed
his
forehead
against
the
pillow


Prince
Andrew
looked
at
his
sister

In
the
dim
shadow
of
the
curtain
her
luminous
eyes
shone
more
brightly
than
usual
from
the
tears
of
joy
that
were
in
them

She
leaned
over
to
her
brother
and
kissed
him

slightly
catching
the
curtain
of
the
cot

Each
made
the
other
a
warning
gesture
and
stood
still
in
the
dim
light
beneath
the
curtain
as
if
not
wishing
to
leave
that
seclusion
where
they
three
were
shut
off
from
all
the
world

Prince
Andrew
was
the
first
to
move
away

ruffling
his
hair
against
the
muslin
of
the
curtain





Yes

this
is
the
one
thing
left
me
now




he
said
with
a
sigh






CHAPTER
X

Soon
after
his
admission
to
the
Masonic
Brotherhood

Pierre
went
to
the
Kiev
province

where
he
had
the
greatest
number
of
serfs

taking
with
him
full
directions
which
he
had
written
down
for
his
own
guidance
as
to
what
he
should
do
on
his
estates


When
he
reached
Kiev
he
sent
for
all
his
stewards
to
the
head
office
and
explained
to
them
his
intentions
and
wishes

He
told
them
that
steps
would
be
taken
immediately
to
free
his
serfs


and
that
till
then
they
were
not
to
be
overburdened
with
labor

women
while
nursing
their
babies
were
not
to
be
sent
to
work

assistance
was
to
be
given
to
the
serfs

punishments
were
to
be
admonitory
and
not
corporal

and
hospitals

asylums

and
schools
were
to
be
established
on
all
the
estates

Some
of
the
stewards

there
were
semiliterate
foremen
among
them

listened
with
alarm

supposing
these
words
to
mean
that
the
young
count
was
displeased
with
their
management
and
embezzlement
of
money

some
after
their
first
fright
were
amused
by
Pierre


s
lisp
and
the
new
words
they
had
not
heard
before

others
simply
enjoyed
hearing
how
the
master
talked

while
the
cleverest
among
them

including
the
chief
steward

understood
from
this
speech
how
they
could
best
handle
the
master
for
their
own
ends


The
chief
steward
expressed
great
sympathy
with
Pierre


s
intentions

but
remarked
that
besides
these
changes
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
into
the
general
state
of
affairs
which
was
far
from
satisfactory


Despite
Count
Bez

khov


s
enormous
wealth

since
he
had
come
into
an
income
which
was
said
to
amount
to
five
hundred
thousand
rubles
a
year

Pierre
felt
himself
far
poorer
than
when
his
father
had
made
him
an
allowance
of
ten
thousand
rubles

He
had
a
dim
perception
of
the
following
budget


About







went
in
payments
on
all
the
estates
to
the
Land
Bank

about







went
for
the
upkeep
of
the
estate
near
Moscow

the
town
house

and
the
allowance
to
the
three
princesses

about







was
given
in
pensions
and
the
same
amount
for
asylums









alimony
was
sent
to
the
countess

about







went
for
interest
on
debts

The
building
of
a
new
church

previously
begun

had
cost
about







in
each
of
the
last
two
years

and
he
did
not
know
how
the
rest

about








rubles

was
spent

and
almost
every
year
he
was
obliged
to
borrow

Besides
this
the
chief
steward
wrote
every
year
telling
him
of
fires
and
bad
harvests

or
of
the
necessity
of
rebuilding
factories
and
workshops

So
the
first
task
Pierre
had
to
face
was
one
for
which
he
had
very
little
aptitude
or
inclination


practical
business


He
discussed
estate
affairs
every
day
with
his
chief
steward

But
he
felt
that
this
did
not
forward
matters
at
all

He
felt
that
these
consultations
were
detached
from
real
affairs
and
did
not
link
up
with
them
or
make
them
move

On
the
one
hand

the
chief
steward
put
the
state
of
things
to
him
in
the
very
worst
light

pointing
out
the
necessity
of
paying
off
the
debts
and
undertaking
new
activities
with
serf
labor

to
which
Pierre
did
not
agree

On
the
other
hand

Pierre
demanded
that
steps
should
be
taken
to
liberate
the
serfs

which
the
steward
met
by
showing
the
necessity
of
first
paying
off
the
loans
from
the
Land
Bank

and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
a
speedy
emancipation


The
steward
did
not
say
it
was
quite
impossible

but
suggested
selling
the
forests
in
the
province
of
Kostrom



the
land
lower
down
the
river

and
the
Crimean
estate

in
order
to
make
it
possible

all
of
which
operations
according
to
him
were
connected
with
such
complicated
measures


the
removal
of
injunctions

petitions

permits

and
so
on


that
Pierre
became
quite
bewildered
and
only
replied





Yes

yes

do
so





Pierre
had
none
of
the
practical
persistence
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
attend
to
the
business
himself
and
so
he
disliked
it
and
only
tried
to
pretend
to
the
steward
that
he
was
attending
to
it

The
steward
for
his
part
tried
to
pretend
to
the
count
that
he
considered
these
consultations
very
valuable
for
the
proprietor
and
troublesome
to
himself


In
Kiev
Pierre
found
some
people
he
knew

and
strangers
hastened
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
joyfully
welcomed
the
rich
newcomer

the
largest
landowner
of
the
province

Temptations
to
Pierre


s
greatest
weakness


the
one
to
which
he
had
confessed
when
admitted
to
the
Lodge


were
so
strong
that
he
could
not
resist
them

Again
whole
days

weeks

and
months
of
his
life
passed
in
as
great
a
rush
and
were
as
much
occupied
with
evening
parties

dinners

lunches

and
balls

giving
him
no
time
for
reflection

as
in
Petersburg

Instead
of
the
new
life
he
had
hoped
to
lead
he
still
lived
the
old
life

only
in
new
surroundings


Of
the
three
precepts
of
Freemasonry
Pierre
realized
that
he
did
not
fulfill
the
one
which
enjoined
every
Mason
to
set
an
example
of
moral
life

and
that
of
the
seven
virtues
he
lacked
two


morality
and
the
love
of
death

He
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
fulfilled
another
of
the
precepts


that
of
reforming
the
human
race


and
had
other
virtues


love
of
his
neighbor

and
especially
generosity


In
the
spring
of





he
decided
to
return
to
Petersburg

On
the
way
he
intended
to
visit
all
his
estates
and
see
for
himself
how
far
his
orders
had
been
carried
out
and
in
what
state
were
the
serfs
whom
God
had
entrusted
to
his
care
and
whom
he
intended
to
benefit


The
chief
steward

who
considered
the
young
count


s
attempts
almost
insane


unprofitable
to
himself

to
the
count

and
to
the
serfs


made
some
concessions

Continuing
to
represent
the
liberation
of
the
serfs
as
impracticable

he
arranged
for
the
erection
of
large
buildings


schools

hospitals

and
asylums


on
all
the
estates
before
the
master
arrived

Everywhere
preparations
were
made
not
for
ceremonious
welcomes

which
he
knew
Pierre
would
not
like


but
for
just
such
gratefully
religious
ones

with
offerings
of
icons
and
the
bread
and
salt
of
hospitality

as

according
to
his
understanding
of
his
master

would
touch
and
delude
him


The
southern
spring

the
comfortable
rapid
traveling
in
a
Vienna
carriage

and
the
solitude
of
the
road

all
had
a
gladdening
effect
on
Pierre

The
estates
he
had
not
before
visited
were
each
more
picturesque
than
the
other

the
serfs
everywhere
seemed
thriving
and
touchingly
grateful
for
the
benefits
conferred
on
them

Everywhere
were
receptions

which
though
they
embarrassed
Pierre
awakened
a
joyful
feeling
in
the
depth
of
his
heart

In
one
place
the
peasants
presented
him
with
bread
and
salt
and
an
icon
of
Saint
Peter
and
Saint
Paul

asking
permission

as
a
mark
of
their
gratitude
for
the
benefits
he
had
conferred
on
them

to
build
a
new
chantry
to
the
church
at
their
own
expense
in
honor
of
Peter
and
Paul

his
patron
saints

In
another
place
the
women
with
infants
in
arms
met
him
to
thank
him
for
releasing
them
from
hard
work

On
a
third
estate
the
priest

bearing
a
cross

came
to
meet
him
surrounded
by
children
whom

by
the
count


s
generosity

he
was
instructing
in
reading

writing

and
religion

On
all
his
estates
Pierre
saw
with
his
own
eyes
brick
buildings
erected
or
in
course
of
erection

all
on
one
plan

for
hospitals

schools

and
almshouses

which
were
soon
to
be
opened

Everywhere
he
saw
the
stewards



accounts

according
to
which
the
serfs



manorial
labor
had
been
diminished

and
heard
the
touching
thanks
of
deputations
of
serfs
in
their
full
skirted
blue
coats


What
Pierre
did
not
know
was
that
the
place
where
they
presented
him
with
bread
and
salt
and
wished
to
build
a
chantry
in
honor
of
Peter
and
Paul
was
a
market
village
where
a
fair
was
held
on
St

Peter


s
day

and
that
the
richest
peasants

who
formed
the
deputation

had
begun
the
chantry
long
before

but
that
nine
tenths
of
the
peasants
in
that
villages
were
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
poverty

He
did
not
know
that
since
the
nursing
mothers
were
no
longer
sent
to
work
on
his
land

they
did
still
harder
work
on
their
own
land

He
did
not
know
that
the
priest
who
met
him
with
the
cross
oppressed
the
peasants
by
his
exactions

and
that
the
pupils



parents
wept
at
having
to
let
him
take
their
children
and
secured
their
release
by
heavy
payments

He
did
not
know
that
the
brick
buildings

built
to
plan

were
being
built
by
serfs
whose
manorial
labor
was
thus
increased

though
lessened
on
paper

He
did
not
know
that
where
the
steward
had
shown
him
in
the
accounts
that
the
serfs



payments
had
been
diminished
by
a
third

their
obligatory
manorial
work
had
been
increased
by
a
half

And
so
Pierre
was
delighted
with
his
visit
to
his
estates
and
quite
recovered
the
philanthropic
mood
in
which
he
had
left
Petersburg

and
wrote
enthusiastic
letters
to
his



brother
instructor



as
he
called
the
Grand
Master





How
easy
it
is

how
little
effort
it
needs

to
do
so
much
good




thought
Pierre




and
how
little
attention
we
pay
to
it





He
was
pleased
at
the
gratitude
he
received

but
felt
abashed
at
receiving
it

This
gratitude
reminded
him
of
how
much
more
he
might
do
for
these
simple

kindly
people


The
chief
steward

a
very
stupid
but
cunning
man
who
saw
perfectly
through
the
na

ve
and
intelligent
count
and
played
with
him
as
with
a
toy

seeing
the
effect
these
prearranged
receptions
had
on
Pierre

pressed
him
still
harder
with
proofs
of
the
impossibility
and
above
all
the
uselessness
of
freeing
the
serfs

who
were
quite
happy
as
it
was


Pierre
in
his
secret
soul
agreed
with
the
steward
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
happier
people

and
that
God
only
knew
what
would
happen
to
them
when
they
were
free

but
he
insisted

though
reluctantly

on
what
he
thought
right

The
steward
promised
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
carry
out
the
count


s
wishes

seeing
clearly
that
not
only
would
the
count
never
be
able
to
find
out
whether
all
measures
had
been
taken
for
the
sale
of
the
land
and
forests
and
to
release
them
from
the
Land
Bank

but
would
probably
never
even
inquire
and
would
never
know
that
the
newly
erected
buildings
were
standing
empty
and
that
the
serfs
continued
to
give
in
money
and
work
all
that
other
people


s
serfs
gave


that
is
to
say

all
that
could
be
got
out
of
them






CHAPTER
XI

Returning
from
his
journey
through
South
Russia
in
the
happiest
state
of
mind

Pierre
carried
out
an
intention
he
had
long
had
of
visiting
his
friend
Bolk

nski

whom
he
had
not
seen
for
two
years


Boguch

rovo
lay
in
a
flat
uninteresting
part
of
the
country
among
fields
and
forests
of
fir
and
birch

which
were
partly
cut
down

The
house
lay
behind
a
newly
dug
pond
filled
with
water
to
the
brink
and
with
banks
still
bare
of
grass

It
was
at
the
end
of
a
village
that
stretched
along
the
highroad
in
the
midst
of
a
young
copse
in
which
were
a
few
fir
trees


The
homestead
consisted
of
a
threshing
floor

outhouses

stables

a
bathhouse

a
lodge

and
a
large
brick
house
with
semicircular
fa

ade
still
in
course
of
construction

Round
the
house
was
a
garden
newly
laid
out

The
fences
and
gates
were
new
and
solid

two
fire
pumps
and
a
water
cart

painted
green

stood
in
a
shed

the
paths
were
straight

the
bridges
were
strong
and
had
handrails

Everything
bore
an
impress
of
tidiness
and
good
management

Some
domestic
serfs
Pierre
met

in
reply
to
inquiries
as
to
where
the
prince
lived

pointed
out
a
small
newly
built
lodge
close
to
the
pond

Ant

n

a
man
who
had
looked
after
Prince
Andrew
in
his
boyhood

helped
Pierre
out
of
his
carriage

said
that
the
prince
was
at
home

and
showed
him
into
a
clean
little
anteroom


Pierre
was
struck
by
the
modesty
of
the
small
though
clean
house
after
the
brilliant
surroundings
in
which
he
had
last
met
his
friend
in
Petersburg


He
quickly
entered
the
small
reception
room
with
its
still
unplastered
wooden
walls
redolent
of
pine

and
would
have
gone
farther

but
Ant

n
ran
ahead
on
tiptoe
and
knocked
at
a
door





Well

what
is
it




came
a
sharp

unpleasant
voice





A
visitor




answered
Ant

n





Ask
him
to
wait




and
the
sound
was
heard
of
a
chair
being
pushed
back


Pierre
went
with
rapid
steps
to
the
door
and
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
Prince
Andrew

who
came
out
frowning
and
looking
old

Pierre
embraced
him
and
lifting
his
spectacles
kissed
his
friend
on
the
cheek
and
looked
at
him
closely





Well

I
did
not
expect
you

I
am
very
glad




said
Prince
Andrew


Pierre
said
nothing

he
looked
fixedly
at
his
friend
with
surprise

He
was
struck
by
the
change
in
him

His
words
were
kindly
and
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
face

but
his
eyes
were
dull
and
lifeless
and
in
spite
of
his
evident
wish
to
do
so
he
could
not
give
them
a
joyous
and
glad
sparkle

Prince
Andrew
had
grown
thinner

paler

and
more
manly
looking

but
what
amazed
and
estranged
Pierre
till
he
got
used
to
it
were
his
inertia
and
a
wrinkle
on
his
brow
indicating
prolonged
concentration
on
some
one
thought


As
is
usually
the
case
with
people
meeting
after
a
prolonged
separation

it
was
long
before
their
conversation
could
settle
on
anything

They
put
questions
and
gave
brief
replies
about
things
they
knew
ought
to
be
talked
over
at
length

At
last
the
conversation
gradually
settled
on
some
of
the
topics
at
first
lightly
touched
on

their
past
life

plans
for
the
future

Pierre


s
journeys
and
occupations

the
war

and
so
on

The
preoccupation
and
despondency
which
Pierre
had
noticed
in
his
friend


s
look
was
now
still
more
clearly
expressed
in
the
smile
with
which
he
listened
to
Pierre

especially
when
he
spoke
with
joyful
animation
of
the
past
or
the
future

It
was
as
if
Prince
Andrew
would
have
liked
to
sympathize
with
what
Pierre
was
saying

but
could
not

The
latter
began
to
feel
that
it
was
in
bad
taste
to
speak
of
his
enthusiasms

dreams

and
hopes
of
happiness
or
goodness

in
Prince
Andrew


s
presence

He
was
ashamed
to
express
his
new
Masonic
views

which
had
been
particularly
revived
and
strengthened
by
his
late
tour

He
checked
himself

fearing
to
seem
na

ve

yet
he
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
show
his
friend
as
soon
as
possible
that
he
was
now
a
quite
different

and
better

Pierre
than
he
had
been
in
Petersburg





I
can


t
tell
you
how
much
I
have
lived
through
since
then

I
hardly
know
myself
again








Yes

we
have
altered
much

very
much

since
then




said
Prince
Andrew





Well

and
you

What
are
your
plans








Plans




repeated
Prince
Andrew
ironically




My
plans




he
said

as
if
astonished
at
the
word




Well

you
see

I


m
building

I
mean
to
settle
here
altogether
next
year








Pierre
looked
silently
and
searchingly
into
Prince
Andrew


s
face

which
had
grown
much
older





No

I
meant
to
ask






Pierre
began

but
Prince
Andrew
interrupted
him





But
why
talk
of
me




Talk
to
me

yes

tell
me
about
your
travels
and
all
you
have
been
doing
on
your
estates





Pierre
began
describing
what
he
had
done
on
his
estates

trying
as
far
as
possible
to
conceal
his
own
part
in
the
improvements
that
had
been
made

Prince
Andrew
several
times
prompted
Pierre


s
story
of
what
he
had
been
doing

as
though
it
were
all
an
old
time
story

and
he
listened
not
only
without
interest
but
even
as
if
ashamed
of
what
Pierre
was
telling
him


Pierre
felt
uncomfortable
and
even
depressed
in
his
friend


s
company
and
at
last
became
silent





I


ll
tell
you
what

my
dear
fellow




said
Prince
Andrew

who
evidently
also
felt
depressed
and
constrained
with
his
visitor




I
am
only
bivouacking
here
and
have
just
come
to
look
round

I
am
going
back
to
my
sister
today

I
will
introduce
you
to
her

But
of
course
you
know
her
already




he
said

evidently
trying
to
entertain
a
visitor
with
whom
he
now
found
nothing
in
common




We
will
go
after
dinner

And
would
you
now
like
to
look
round
my
place





They
went
out
and
walked
about
till
dinnertime

talking
of
the
political
news
and
common
acquaintances
like
people
who
do
not
know
each
other
intimately

Prince
Andrew
spoke
with
some
animation
and
interest
only
of
the
new
homestead
he
was
constructing
and
its
buildings

but
even
here

while
on
the
scaffolding

in
the
midst
of
a
talk
explaining
the
future
arrangements
of
the
house

he
interrupted
himself





However

this
is
not
at
all
interesting

Let
us
have
dinner

and
then
we


ll
set
off





At
dinner

conversation
turned
on
Pierre


s
marriage





I
was
very
much
surprised
when
I
heard
of
it




said
Prince
Andrew


Pierre
blushed

as
he
always
did
when
it
was
mentioned

and
said
hurriedly




I
will
tell
you
some
time
how
it
all
happened

But
you
know
it
is
all
over

and
forever








Forever




said
Prince
Andrew




Nothing


s
forever








But
you
know
how
it
all
ended

don


t
you

You
heard
of
the
duel








And
so
you
had
to
go
through
that
too








One
thing
I
thank
God
for
is
that
I
did
not
kill
that
man




said
Pierre





Why
so




asked
Prince
Andrew




To
kill
a
vicious
dog
is
a
very
good
thing
really








No

to
kill
a
man
is
bad


wrong








Why
is
it
wrong




urged
Prince
Andrew




It
is
not
given
to
man
to
know
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong

Men
always
did
and
always
will
err

and
in
nothing
more
than
in
what
they
consider
right
and
wrong








What
does
harm
to
another
is
wrong




said
Pierre

feeling
with
pleasure
that
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
Prince
Andrew
was
roused

had
begun
to
talk

and
wanted
to
express
what
had
brought
him
to
his
present
state





And
who
has
told
you
what
is
bad
for
another
man




he
asked





Bad

Bad




exclaimed
Pierre




We
all
know
what
is
bad
for
ourselves








Yes

we
know
that

but
the
harm
I
am
conscious
of
in
myself
is
something
I
cannot
inflict
on
others




said
Prince
Andrew

growing
more
and
more
animated
and
evidently
wishing
to
express
his
new
outlook
to
Pierre

He
spoke
in
French




I
only
know
two
very
real
evils
in
life

remorse
and
illness

The
only
good
is
the
absence
of
those
evils

To
live
for
myself
avoiding
those
two
evils
is
my
whole
philosophy
now








And
love
of
one


s
neighbor

and
self
sacrifice




began
Pierre




No

I
can


t
agree
with
you

To
live
only
so
as
not
to
do
evil
and
not
to
have
to
repent
is
not
enough

I
lived
like
that

I
lived
for
myself
and
ruined
my
life

And
only
now
when
I
am
living

or
at
least
trying




Pierre


s
modesty
made
him
correct
himself




to
live
for
others

only
now
have
I
understood
all
the
happiness
of
life

No

I
shall
not
agree
with
you

and
you
do
not
really
believe
what
you
are
saying




Prince
Andrew
looked
silently
at
Pierre
with
an
ironic
smile





When
you
see
my
sister

Princess
Mary

you


ll
get
on
with
her




he
said




Perhaps
you
are
right
for
yourself




he
added
after
a
short
pause




but
everyone
lives
in
his
own
way

You
lived
for
yourself
and
say
you
nearly
ruined
your
life
and
only
found
happiness
when
you
began
living
for
others

I
experienced
just
the
reverse

I
lived
for
glory



And
after
all
what
is
glory

The
same
love
of
others

a
desire
to
do
something
for
them

a
desire
for
their
approval



So
I
lived
for
others

and
not
almost

but
quite

ruined
my
life

And
I
have
become
calmer
since
I
began
to
live
only
for
myself








But
what
do
you
mean
by
living
only
for
yourself




asked
Pierre

growing
excited




What
about
your
son

your
sister

and
your
father








But
that


s
just
the
same
as
myself


they
are
not
others




explained
Prince
Andrew




The
others

one


s
neighbors

le
prochain

as
you
and
Princess
Mary
call
it

are
the
chief
source
of
all
error
and
evil

Le
prochain


your
Kiev
peasants
to
whom
you
want
to
do
good





And
he
looked
at
Pierre
with
a
mocking

challenging
expression

He
evidently
wished
to
draw
him
on





You
are
joking




replied
Pierre

growing
more
and
more
excited




What
error
or
evil
can
there
be
in
my
wishing
to
do
good

and
even
doing
a
little


though
I
did
very
little
and
did
it
very
badly

What
evil
can
there
be
in
it
if
unfortunate
people

our
serfs

people
like
ourselves

were
growing
up
and
dying
with
no
idea
of
God
and
truth
beyond
ceremonies
and
meaningless
prayers
and
are
now
instructed
in
a
comforting
belief
in
future
life

retribution

recompense

and
consolation

What
evil
and
error
are
there
in
it

if
people
were
dying
of
disease
without
help
while
material
assistance
could
so
easily
be
rendered

and
I
supplied
them
with
a
doctor

a
hospital

and
an
asylum
for
the
aged

And
is
it
not
a
palpable

unquestionable
good
if
a
peasant

or
a
woman
with
a
baby

has
no
rest
day
or
night
and
I
give
them
rest
and
leisure




said
Pierre

hurrying
and
lisping




And
I
have
done
that
though
badly
and
to
a
small
extent

but
I
have
done
something
toward
it
and
you
cannot
persuade
me
that
it
was
not
a
good
action

and
more
than
that

you
can


t
make
me
believe
that
you
do
not
think
so
yourself

And
the
main
thing
is




he
continued




that
I
know

and
know
for
certain

that
the
enjoyment
of
doing
this
good
is
the
only
sure
happiness
in
life








Yes

if
you
put
it
like
that
it


s
quite
a
different
matter




said
Prince
Andrew




I
build
a
house
and
lay
out
a
garden

and
you
build
hospitals

The
one
and
the
other
may
serve
as
a
pastime

But
what


s
right
and
what


s
good
must
be
judged
by
one
who
knows
all

but
not
by
us

Well

you
want
an
argument




he
added




come
on
then





They
rose
from
the
table
and
sat
down
in
the
entrance
porch
which
served
as
a
veranda





Come

let


s
argue
then




said
Prince
Andrew




You
talk
of
schools




he
went
on

crooking
a
finger




education
and
so
forth

that
is

you
want
to
raise
him




pointing
to
a
peasant
who
passed
by
them
taking
off
his
cap




from
his
animal
condition
and
awaken
in
him
spiritual
needs

while
it
seems
to
me
that
animal
happiness
is
the
only
happiness
possible

and
that
is
just
what
you
want
to
deprive
him
of

I
envy
him

but
you
want
to
make
him
what
I
am

without
giving
him
my
means

Then
you
say




lighten
his
toil




But
as
I
see
it

physical
labor
is
as
essential
to
him

as
much
a
condition
of
his
existence

as
mental
activity
is
to
you
or
me

You
can


t
help
thinking

I
go
to
bed
after
two
in
the
morning

thoughts
come
and
I
can


t
sleep
but
toss
about
till
dawn

because
I
think
and
can


t
help
thinking

just
as
he
can


t
help
plowing
and
mowing

if
he
didn


t

he
would
go
to
the
drink
shop
or
fall
ill

Just
as
I
could
not
stand
his
terrible
physical
labor
but
should
die
of
it
in
a
week

so
he
could
not
stand
my
physical
idleness

but
would
grow
fat
and
die

The
third
thing


what
else
was
it
you
talked
about




and
Prince
Andrew
crooked
a
third
finger




Ah

yes

hospitals

medicine

He
has
a
fit

he
is
dying

and
you
come
and
bleed
him
and
patch
him
up

He
will
drag
about
as
a
cripple

a
burden
to
everybody

for
another
ten
years

It
would
be
far
easier
and
simpler
for
him
to
die

Others
are
being
born
and
there
are
plenty
of
them
as
it
is

It
would
be
different
if
you
grudged
losing
a
laborer


that


s
how
I
regard
him


but
you
want
to
cure
him
from
love
of
him

And
he
does
not
want
that

And
besides

what
a
notion
that
medicine
ever
cured
anyone

Killed
them

yes




said
he

frowning
angrily
and
turning
away
from
Pierre


Prince
Andrew
expressed
his
ideas
so
clearly
and
distinctly
that
it
was
evident
he
had
reflected
on
this
subject
more
than
once

and
he
spoke
readily
and
rapidly
like
a
man
who
has
not
talked
for
a
long
time

His
glance
became
more
animated
as
his
conclusions
became
more
hopeless





Oh

that
is
dreadful

dreadful




said
Pierre




I
don


t
understand
how
one
can
live
with
such
ideas

I
had
such
moments
myself
not
long
ago

in
Moscow
and
when
traveling

but
at
such
times
I
collapsed
so
that
I
don


t
live
at
all


everything
seems
hateful
to
me



myself
most
of
all

Then
I
don


t
eat

don


t
wash



and
how
is
it
with
you











Why
not
wash

That
is
not
cleanly




said
Prince
Andrew




on
the
contrary
one
must
try
to
make
one


s
life
as
pleasant
as
possible

I


m
alive

that
is
not
my
fault

so
I
must
live
out
my
life
as
best
I
can
without
hurting
others








But
with
such
ideas
what
motive
have
you
for
living

One
would
sit
without
moving

undertaking
nothing











Life
as
it
is
leaves
one
no
peace

I
should
be
thankful
to
do
nothing

but
here
on
the
one
hand
the
local
nobility
have
done
me
the
honor
to
choose
me
to
be
their
marshal

it
was
all
I
could
do
to
get
out
of
it

They
could
not
understand
that
I
have
not
the
necessary
qualifications
for
it


the
kind
of
good
natured

fussy
shallowness
necessary
for
the
position

Then
there


s
this
house

which
must
be
built
in
order
to
have
a
nook
of
one


s
own
in
which
to
be
quiet

And
now
there


s
this
recruiting








Why
aren


t
you
serving
in
the
army








After
Austerlitz




said
Prince
Andrew
gloomily




No

thank
you
very
much

I
have
promised
myself
not
to
serve
again
in
the
active
Russian
army

And
I
won


t


not
even
if
Bonaparte
were
here
at
Smol

nsk
threatening
Bald
Hills


even
then
I
wouldn


t
serve
in
the
Russian
army

Well

as
I
was
saying




he
continued

recovering
his
composure




now
there


s
this
recruiting

My
father
is
chief
in
command
of
the
Third
District

and
my
only
way
of
avoiding
active
service
is
to
serve
under
him








Then
you
are
serving








I
am





He
paused
a
little
while





And
why
do
you
serve








Why

for
this
reason

My
father
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
his
time

But
he
is
growing
old

and
though
not
exactly
cruel
he
has
too
energetic
a
character

He
is
so
accustomed
to
unlimited
power
that
he
is
terrible

and
now
he
has
this
authority
of
a
commander
in
chief
of
the
recruiting

granted
by
the
Emperor

If
I
had
been
two
hours
late
a
fortnight
ago
he
would
have
had
a
paymaster


s
clerk
at
Y

khnovna
hanged




said
Prince
Andrew
with
a
smile




So
I
am
serving
because
I
alone
have
any
influence
with
my
father

and
now
and
then
can
save
him
from
actions
which
would
torment
him
afterwards








Well

there
you
see








Yes

but
it
is
not
as
you
imagine




Prince
Andrew
continued




I
did
not

and
do
not

in
the
least
care
about
that
scoundrel
of
a
clerk
who
had
stolen
some
boots
from
the
recruits

I
should
even
have
been
very
glad
to
see
him
hanged

but
I
was
sorry
for
my
father


that
again
is
for
myself





Prince
Andrew
grew
more
and
more
animated

His
eyes
glittered
feverishly
while
he
tried
to
prove
to
Pierre
that
in
his
actions
there
was
no
desire
to
do
good
to
his
neighbor





There
now

you
wish
to
liberate
your
serfs




he
continued




that
is
a
very
good
thing

but
not
for
you


I
don


t
suppose
you
ever
had
anyone
flogged
or
sent
to
Siberia


and
still
less
for
your
serfs

If
they
are
beaten

flogged

or
sent
to
Siberia

I
don


t
suppose
they
are
any
the
worse
off

In
Siberia
they
lead
the
same
animal
life

and
the
stripes
on
their
bodies
heal

and
they
are
happy
as
before

But
it
is
a
good
thing
for
proprietors
who
perish
morally

bring
remorse
upon
themselves

stifle
this
remorse
and
grow
callous

as
a
result
of
being
able
to
inflict
punishments
justly
and
unjustly

It
is
those
people
I
pity

and
for
their
sake
I
should
like
to
liberate
the
serfs

You
may
not
have
seen

but
I
have
seen

how
good
men
brought
up
in
those
traditions
of
unlimited
power

in
time
when
they
grow
more
irritable

become
cruel
and
harsh

are
conscious
of
it

but
cannot
restrain
themselves
and
grow
more
and
more
miserable





Prince
Andrew
spoke
so
earnestly
that
Pierre
could
not
help
thinking
that
these
thoughts
had
been
suggested
to
Prince
Andrew
by
his
father


s
case


He
did
not
reply





So
that


s
what
I


m
sorry
for


human
dignity

peace
of
mind

purity

and
not
the
serfs



backs
and
foreheads

which

beat
and
shave
as
you
may

always
remain
the
same
backs
and
foreheads








No

no

A
thousand
times
no

I
shall
never
agree
with
you




said
Pierre






CHAPTER
XII

In
the
evening
Andrew
and
Pierre
got
into
the
open
carriage
and
drove
to
Bald
Hills

Prince
Andrew

glancing
at
Pierre

broke
the
silence
now
and
then
with
remarks
which
showed
that
he
was
in
a
good
temper


Pointing
to
the
fields

he
spoke
of
the
improvements
he
was
making
in
his
husbandry


Pierre
remained
gloomily
silent

answering
in
monosyllables
and
apparently
immersed
in
his
own
thoughts


He
was
thinking
that
Prince
Andrew
was
unhappy

had
gone
astray

did
not
see
the
true
light

and
that
he

Pierre

ought
to
aid

enlighten

and
raise
him

But
as
soon
as
he
thought
of
what
he
should
say

he
felt
that
Prince
Andrew
with
one
word

one
argument
