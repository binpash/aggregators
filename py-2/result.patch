-It is after dinner on a January night, in the library in
-comfortable settee is in the middle of the room, upholstered in
-dark leather. A person sitting on it [it is vacant at present]
-would have, on his right, Lady Britomart's writing table, with
-on his left; the door behind him on Lady Britomart's side; and a
-window with a window seat directly on his left. Near the window
-is an armchair.
-Lady Britomart is a woman of fifty or thereabouts, well dressed
-Her son, Stephen, comes in. He is a gravely correct young man
-his mother, from childish habit and bachelor shyness rather than
-Stephen submissively walks to the settee and sits down. He takes
-Speaker]. Now! [She finishes her writing; rises; and comes to the
-the settee]. Sit down. [He sits down and fingers his tie
-nervously]. Don't fiddle with your tie, Stephen: there is nothing
-STEPHEN. I beg your pardon. [He fiddles with his watch chain
-speak to you very seriously, Stephen. I wish you would let that
-STEPHEN [hastily relinquishing the chain] Have I done anything to
-LADY BRITOMART [astonished] Nonsense! [With some remorse] My poor
-STEPHEN. What is it, then, mother? You are making me very uneasy.
-LADY BRITOMART. Don't repeat my words, please: It is a most
-affairs any longer. You must advise me: you must assume the
-your time most scandalously. Well, advise me.
-know is so painful--it is so impossible to mention some things to
-for Sarah. Charles Lomax will be a millionaire at 35. But that is
-ten years ahead; and in the meantime his trustees cannot under
-the terms of his father's will allow him more than 800 pounds a

-by his own exertions, they may double the increase.
-decrease his income than to increase it. Sarah will have to find
-Army; discharges her maid; lives on a pound a week; and walks in
-the street, and who pretends to be a Salvationist, and actually
-were engaged. Cusins is a very nice fellow, certainly: nobody
-thank Heaven, is not a pig-headed Tory one. We are Whigs, and
-believe in liberty. Let snobbish people say what they please:
-STEPHEN. Of course I was thinking only of his income. However, he
-is not likely to be extravagant.
-that as well as I do. [Stephen closes his lips and is silent].
-STEPHEN. I am not sulking, mother. What has all this got to do
-LADY BRITOMART. My dear Stephen: where is the money to come from?
-It is easy enough for you and the other children to live on my
-families in four separate houses. You know how poor my father is:
-can do nothing for us: he says, naturally enough, that it is
-man who is rolling in money. You see, Stephen, your father must
-be fabulously wealthy, because there is always a war going on
-Undershaft ten inch! the Undershaft disappearing rampart gun! the
-Lazarus, Death and Destruction Dealers: address, Christendom and
-LADY BRITOMART. It is not only the cannons, but the war loans
-their thumbs. That is why your father is able to behave as he
-does. He is above the law. Do you think Bismarck or Gladstone or
-Disraeli could have openly defied every social and moral
-LADY BRITOMART. Not break the law! He is always breaking the law.
-He broke the law when he was born: his parents were not married.
-STEPHEN. He married without letting you know this!
-LADY BRITOMART [rather taken aback by this inference] Oh no. To
-foundling himself: he wanted to disinherit you for another
-LADY BRITOMART. Don't stammer, Stephen. Speak distinctly.
-STEPHEN. But this is so frightful to me, mother. To have to speak
-you are still so childish that you must make it worse by a
-display of embarrassment. It is only in the middle classes,
-class, we have to decide what is to be done with wicked people;
-and nothing should disturb our self possession. Now ask your
-LADY BRITOMART. Treat you as a child! What do you mean? It is
-alone for once, and tell me about this horrible business of my
-kind. I never dreamt of such a thing. This is what comes of
-and listen to me patiently. The Undershafts are descended from a
-foundling in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft in the city.
-That was long ago, in the reign of James the First. Well, this
-my father remonstrated, Andrew actually told him to his face that
-history tells us of only two successful institutions: one the
-their successors. Such rubbish! The Stevenages are as good as the
-really cannot bear an immoral man. I am not a Pharisee, I hope;
-and I should not have minded his merely doing wrong things: we
-one doesn't mind men practising immorality so long as they own
-forgive Andrew for preaching immorality while he practised
-ways. Children did not dislike him; and he took advantage of it
-unmanageable. I did not dislike him myself: very far from it; but
-nothing can bridge over moral disagreement.
-STEPHEN. All this simply bewilders me, mother. People may differ
-they differ about right and wrong? Right is right; and wrong is
-wrong; and if a man cannot distinguish them properly, he is
-LADY BRITOMART [touched] That's my own boy [she pats his cheek]!
-understand the situation, what do you advise me to do?
-take a farthing of his money.
-STEPHEN [bitterly] We are utterly dependent on him and his
-LADY BRITOMART. Certainly not: the money is settled. But he
-provided it. So you see it is not a question of taking money from
-him or not: it is simply a question of how much. I don't want any
-LADY BRITOMART. But Sarah does; and Barbara does. That is,
-put my pride in my pocket and ask for it, I suppose. That is your
-advice, Stephen, is it not?
-well, Stephen: It shall be as you wish. You will be glad to know
-is necessary that he should pay us a visit, don't you?
-without his money.
-your father to come this evening. [Stephen bounds from his seat]
-father is coming here to-night--that he may be here at any
-rises]. Ring the bell, please. [Stephen goes to the smaller
-writing table; presses a button on it; and sits at it with his
-elbows on the table and his head in his hands, outwitted and
-overwhelmed]. It is ten minutes to nine yet; and I have to
-case he should cherish any delusions as to their being capable of
-behind the settee to speak to him]. Morrison: go up to the
-[Morrison withdraws. Lady Britomart turns to Stephen]. Now
-authority. [He rises and tries to recover some vestige of these
-Charles Lomax and Adolphus Cusins. Sarah is slender, bored, and
-mundane. Barbara is robuster, jollier, much more energetic. Sarah
-is fashionably dressed: Barbara is in Salvation Army uniform.
-Lomax, a young man about town, is like many other young men about
-town. He is affected with a frivolous sense of humor which
-imperfectly suppressed laughter. Cusins is a spectacled student,
-of Lomax's complaint. His sense of humor is intellectual and
-subtle, and is complicated by an appalling temper. The lifelong
-set up a chronic strain which has visibly wrecked his constitution.
-He is a most implacable, determined, tenacious, intolerant person
-actually is--considerate, gentle, explanatory, even mild and
-coarseness. By the operation of some instinct which is not merciful
-enough to blind him with the illusions of love, he is obstinately
-resist Lady Britomart's arrangements to that end.
-BARBARA. It's all right, mother. Cholly is quite correct
-SARAH [calling] Come in, Cholly. [Lomax enters, controlling his
-Adolphus. I am surprised at you, though I expected nothing better
-LADY BRITOMART. Be quiet, Charles. Now listen to me, children.
-Your father is coming here this evening. [General stupefaction].
-LADY BRITOMART. Of course I am serious. It is on your account,
-LADY BRITOMART [frigidly] What do you wish to convey, Charles?
-LOMAX. Well, you must admit that this is a bit thick.
-remarks into reputable English for us?
-LADY BRITOMART [crushingly] Thank you. Have I your permission,
-SARAH. Do you mean that he is coming regularly to live here?
-LADY BRITOMART. Certainly not. The spare room is ready for him if
-result is, you never mean anything. And now please attend to me,
-seen his children since they were babies, he will form his
-to-night, and that therefore you wish us all to be particularly
-recollection is perfectly correct. It is most important that you
-opposite corners and giggle and whisper while I am speaking to
-Morrison, pale and dismayed, breaks into the room in unconcealed
-disorder.
-LOMAX. Does Morrison know who he is?
-LADY BRITOMART. Of course. Morrison has always been with us.
-LADY BRITOMART. Is this a moment to get on my nerves, Charles,
-LOMAX. But this is something out of the ordinary, really--
-Andrew Undershaft comes in. All rise. Lady Britomart meets him in
-Andrew is, on the surface, a stoutish, easygoing elderly man,
-character. But he has a watchful, deliberate, waiting, listening
-in his capacious chest and long head. His gentleness is partly
-that of a strong man who has learnt by experience that his
-carefully, and partly the mellowness of age and success. He is
-also a little shy in his present very delicate situation.
-LADY BRITOMART [promptly] Rubbish! This is your family.
-UNDERSHAFT [surprised] Is it so large? I am sorry to say my
-memory is failing very badly in some things. [He offers his hand
-LOMAX [jerkily shaking his hand] Ahdedoo.
-Am I making any ridiculous mistake? I may as well confess: I
-LADY BRITOMART [decisively] Andrew: you are talking nonsense. Of
-LADY BRITOMART. That is Charles Lomax, who is engaged to Sarah.
-LADY BRITOMART. This is Stephen.
-in his] How are you, my young friend? [To Lady Britomart] He is
-CUSINS. You flatter me, Mr Undershaft. My name is Cusins: engaged
-to Barbara. [Very explicitly] That is Major Barbara Undershaft,
-of the Salvation Army. That is Sarah, your second daughter. This
-is Stephen Undershaft, your son.
-so precisely. [Turning to Sarah] Barbara, my dear--
-Barbara] Barbara--I am right this time, I hope.
-brings his chair forward on her left. Barbara and Stephen resume
-their seats. Lomax gives his chair to Sarah and goes for
-UNDERSHAFT [accepting the chair] That is not what embarrasses me,
-Mr Lomax. My difficulty is that if I play the part of a father, I
-the part of a discreet stranger, I may appear a callous father.
-LADY BRITOMART. There is no need for you to play any part at all,
-UNDERSHAFT [submissively] Yes, my dear: I daresay that will be
-CUSINS. Let me advise you to study Greek, Mr Undershaft. Greek
-them know anything else; but their position is unchallengeable.
-travellers: Greek is to a man of position what the hallmark is to
-LOMAX [doubtfully to Undershaft] Perhaps that sort of thing isn't
-BARBARA. No: he says it's bad form to be a dissenter. But I don't
-dock gates, and take the collection in his hat.
-LADY BRITOMART. It is not my doing, Andrew. Barbara is old enough
-to take her own way. She has no father to advise her.
-How did you come to understand that? [Lomax is heard at the door
-LOMAX. Righto! [He sits down in his former place, and preludes].
-heaven is not exactly in your line, is it?
-cannons; but it isn't right, you know. On the other hand, there
-belong to the Established Church myself--but still you can't deny
-specially amiable humor just now because, this morning, down at
-sooner it will be abolished, eh?
-done so; and I always shall. Therefore your Christmas card
-to me. Your Christianity, which enjoins you to resist not evil,
-UNDERSHAFT. For me there is only one true morality; but it might
-is only one true morality for every man; but every man has not
-CUSINS. It's quite simple. As Euripides says, one man's meat is
-another man's poison morally as well as physically.

-BARBARA. Yes. Give us Onward, Christian Soldiers.
-is the only one that capable people really care for.
-to have it, I insist on having it in a proper and respectable
-way. Charles: ring for prayers. [General amazement. Stephen rises
-in dismay].
-LOMAX [rising] Oh I say!
-UNDERSHAFT [rising] I am afraid I must be going.
-a compromise? If Barbara will conduct a little service in the
-drawingroom, with Mr Lomax as organist, I will attend it
-half the Army came to their first meeting for a lark. [Rising]
-Undershaft, who opens the door for her. Cusins rises].
-LADY BRITOMART. I will not be disobeyed by everybody. Adolphus:
-yourself if you choose to. I insist on your staying.
-things we ought to have done, and that there is no health in us.
-remember this, Adolphus [he turns to listen]: I have a very
-than to sit there as if you wished you were a thousand miles
-LADY BRITOMART [swishing away her tears with her handkerchief]
-Nothing. Foolishness. You can go with him, too, if you like, and
-LADY BRITOMART. The others do. That is the injustice of a woman's
-to punish them when they do wrong, to do all the unpleasant
-and spoil them, comes in when all her work is done and steals
-STEPHEN. He has not stolen our affection from you. It is only
-LADY BRITOMART [violently] I won't be consoled, Stephen. There is
-nothing the matter with me. [She rises and goes towards the
-Onward, Christian Soldiers, on the concertina, with tambourine
-accompaniment, is heard when the door opens]. Are you coming,

-The yard of the West Ham shelter of the Salvation Army is a cold
-warehouse, is newly whitewashed. Its gabled end projects into the
-pulley rigged over it for hoisting sacks. Those who come from
-this central gable end into the yard have the gateway leading to

-BARBARA [with a steady soothing hand on his arm and a gentle
-eternal glory in heaven. [He is on the point of breaking down].
-Come. [A drum is heard in the shelter; and Bill, with a gasp,
-me introduce a new friend of mine, Mr Bill Walker. This is my
-bloke, Bill: Mr Cusins. [Cusins salutes with his drumstick].
-CUSINS. That is a frightful reflection, Mr Walker. But I can't
-fair or is it not? You're a genlmn: you oughter know.
-CUSINS. Well, it will give Mr Fairmile some exercise; and it will
-satisfy Mr Walker's soul.
-CUSINS. Not at all. [He is suddenly softened, and kisses her over
-the drum, evidently not for the first time, as people cannot kiss
-UNDERSHAFT. I fancy you guess something of what is in my mind, Mr
-Cusins. [Cusins flourishes his drumsticks as if in the art of
-The fact is, I am a sort of collector of religions; and the
-curious thing is that I find I can believe them all. By the way,
-CUSINS [disappointed, but polite] Ah, the Church Catechism.
-Charles Lomax also belongs to the Established Church.
-CUSINS. Baptism and--
-CUSINS [surprised, but interested] That is the general opinion of
-our governing classes. The novelty is in hearing any man confess
-CUSINS. Excuse me: is there any place in your religion for honor,
-CUSINS. Suppose one is forced to choose between them and money or
-CUSINS. That is your religion?
-The cadence of this reply makes a full close in the conversation.
-Cusins twists his face dubiously and contemplates Undershaft.
-drum of yours is hollow.
-CUSINS. Father Undershaft: you are mistaken: I am a sincere
-Salvationist. You do not understand the Salvation Army. It is the
-army of joy, of love, of courage: it has banished the fear and
-its happy garrison. It picks the waster out of the public house
-his meal of roots, and lets loose the rhapsodist in him; reveals
-street drumming dithyrambs [he plays a thundering flourish on the
-In money and guns may outpass his brother;
-And they win their will; or they miss their will;
-That to live is happy, has found his heaven.

-CUSINS. You are damnably discouraging. [He resumes his
-What else is Wisdom? What of Man's endeavor,
-CUSINS. It is a fair translation. The word means Loveliness.
-is to be loved for ever on?
-CUSINS. As Barbara's father, that is more your affair than mine.
-I can feed her by teaching Greek: that is about all.
-weak, timid, ineffectual person; and my health is far from
-satisfactory. But whenever I feel that I must have anything, I
-settled.--Not that I wish to be arbitrary; but why should I waste
-your time in discussing what is inevitable?
-CUSINS. The business of the Salvation Army is to save, not to
-UNDERSHAFT [rising and approaching him] Professor Cusins you are
-Undershaft mutely offers his hand. They shake.
-CUSINS. Pardon me. We were discussing religion. Why go back to
-UNDERSHAFT. Religion is our business at present, because it is
-CUSINS. A father's love for a grown-up daughter is the most
-pale, coy, mistrustful fancy in the same breath with it.
-neither of us Methodists.
-power that wields Barbara herself--is not Calvinism, not
-Presbyterianism, not Methodism--
-UNDERSHAFT. Not Greek Paganism either, eh?
-CUSINS. I admit that. Barbara is quite original in her religion.
-UNDERSHAFT [in towering excitement] It is the Undershaft
-CUSINS [urbanely: trying to bring him down to earth] This is

-this Salvation shelter to-day?
-CUSINS. You mean Barbara is as mad as we are!
-UNDERSHAFT [pushing him lightly off and resuming his equanimity
-is a savior of souls. What have we three to do with the common
-CUSINS. Take care! Barbara is in love with the common people. So
-Poverty, like St Francis? Have you ever been in love with Dirt,
-like St Simeon? Have you ever been in love with disease and
-suffering, like our nurses and philanthropists? Such passions are
-not virtues, but the most unnatural of all the vices. This love
-pretend that poverty is a blessing: leave it to the coward to
-make a religion of his cowardice by preaching humility: we know
-UNDERSHAFT. You shall see. All religious organizations exist by
-CUSINS. Not the Army. That is the Church of the poor.

-UNDERSHAFT. It is certainly most convenient and gratifying to all

-BARBARA. Who is Lord Saxmundham? I never heard of him.
-UNDERSHAFT [who has pricked up his ears at the peer's name, and
-is now watching Barbara curiously] A new creation, my dear. You
-BARBARA. Bodger! Do you mean the distiller? Bodger's whisky!
-UNDERSHAFT. That is the man. He is one of the greatest of our
-of his party: they made him a baron for that.
-UNDERSHAFT. There is nothing left to give him. So the five
-thousand, I should think, is to save his soul.
-thousand? We are going to hold a great meeting this afternoon at

-satisfaction of making Bodger pay up. You shall have your five

-BILL [cynically, aside to Barbara, his voice and accent horribly
-surprise]. Mrs Baines: are you really going to take this money?
-MRS BAINES [astonished] Why not, dear?
-BARBARA. Why not! Do you know what my father is? Have you

-CUSINS [impishly] Pure self-sacrifice on Bodger's part, clearly!

-claim a little disinterestedness. Think of my business! think of
-shrapnel and poisoned with lyddite [Mrs Baines shrinks; but he

-CUSINS [in a convulsion of irony] Let us seize this unspeakable
-the meeting. Barbara shall tell them that the Army is saved, and
-the flag]. Mr Undershaft is a gifted trombonist: he shall intone

-LOMAX [rising and going to Sarah] How is my ownest today?
-SARAH. I wish you wouldn't tell Cholly to do things, Barbara. He

-Cusins enters in poor condition. He also starts visibly when he

-of my moral basis, the rout of my convictions, the purchase of my

-CUSINS. Yes: that is our understanding. I know it. I hold to it.

-Darkness played his trombone like a madman: its brazen roarings

-CUSINS [disingenuously] Well--er--well, possibly, as a collector
-apparent to you that there is a certain amount of tosh about--
-LOMAX [out of countenance] Well, drivel is drivel, don't you
-at all ages by repeating silly formulas with an air of wisdom.
-The Times. You will find that there is a certain amount of tosh
-about The Times; but at least its language is reputable.
-LADY BRITOMART. Rubbish! [Morrison comes in]. What is it?
-LADY BRITOMART. Well, let him in. [Morrison hesitates]. What's
-MORRISON. Shall I announce him, my lady; or is he at home here,
-The occasion is in a manner of speaking new to me.
-Undershaft comes in. Morrison goes out.
-LADY BRITOMART [rising] Don't be sentimental, Andrew. Sit down.
-have 800 pounds a year until Charles Lomax comes into his
-LADY BRITOMART. He does interest me. He is our son.
-him into the world; but he chose his parents very incongruously,
-LADY BRITOMART. Andrew: Stephen is an excellent son, and a most
-find an excuse for disinheriting him.
-UNDERSHAFT. My dear Biddy: the Undershaft tradition disinherits
-him. It would be dishonest of me to leave the cannon foundry to
-leave it to anyone else, Andrew. Do you suppose this wicked and
-LADY BRITOMART. There is nothing that any Italian or German could
-UNDERSHAFT. True. Probably I have. That is another argument in
-UNDERSHAFT. This conversation is part of the Undershaft
-ever since the house was founded. It is mere waste of breath. If
-you are not wanted here. Go to your foundling, whoever he is; and
-UNDERSHAFT. The fact is, Biddy--
-UNDERSHAFT. I will not call my wife Britomart: it is not good
-has at last made a stand and insisted that the succession must be
-settled one way or the other; and of course he is quite right.
-LADY BRITOMART [obstinately] There is Stephen.

-nowadays is snapped up in his infancy by Barnardo homes, or
-the least ability, he is fastened on by schoolmasters; trained to
-drilled and disciplined in docility and what they call good
-taste; and lamed for life so that he is fit for nothing but
-LADY BRITOMART. Andrew: this is not a question of our likings and
-dislikings: it is a question of duty. It is your duty to make
-UNDERSHAFT. Just as much as it is your duty to submit to your
-no use with me. I am one of the governing class myself; and it is
-waste of time giving tracts to a missionary. I have the power in
-this matter; and I am not to be humbugged into using it for your
-change wrong into right. And your tie is all on one side. Put it
-UNDERSHAFT [disconcerted] It won't stay unless it's pinned [he
-fumbles at it with childish grimaces]--
-his mother's writing table.]
-LADY BRITOMART. Yes. [To Stephen] It is what I told you last
-UNDERSHAFT [opening his eyes, greatly eased in mind and manner]
-enterprise.
-UNDERSHAFT [rising] My dear boy: this is an immense relief to me.
-was afraid you would consider yourself disparaged and slighted.
-LADY BRITOMART [rising and interposing] Stephen: I cannot allow
-you to throw away an enormous property like this.
-by his tone]. Until last night I did not take your attitude
-offended. Any further discussion of my intentions had better take
-UNDERSHAFT [with grave compassion] You see, my dear, it is only
-is achieved: you have won your latchkey. Don't rub it in; and
-above all, don't apologize. [He resumes his seat]. Now what about
-strong enough. [Stephen sits down magisterially in the chair at
-the writing table with an air of affirming his majority].
-UNDERSHAFT. It is settled that you do not ask for the succession
-STEPHEN. I hope it is settled that I repudiate the cannon
-UNDERSHAFT. Come, come! Don't be so devilishly sulky: it's
-boyish. Freedom should be generous. Besides, I owe you a fair
-start in life in exchange for disinheriting you. You can't become
-prime minister all at once. Haven't you a turn for something?
-STEPHEN. I have nothing of the artist about me, either in faculty
-UNDERSHAFT. Just so. Well, there is the army, the navy, the Church,
-necessary push--I believe that is the name barristers give to
-left but the stage, is there? [Stephen makes an impatient
-movement]. Well, come! is there anything you know or care for?

-muddled all the men of business, and ruined most of the artists:

-Why are we two coming to this Works Department of Hell? that is

-UNDERSHAFT [to Cusins] You are an educated man. That is against

-LADY BRITOMART. There is no moral question in the matter at all,
-whose cause is right and just, and refuse them to foreigners and
-CUSINS. What on earth is the true faith of an Armorer?
-them, without respect of persons or principles: to aristocrat and
-republican, to Nihilist and Tsar, to Capitalist and Socialist, to
-crimes. The first Undershaft wrote up in his shop IF GOD GAVE THE
-this place: it drives you. And what drives the place?
-CUSINS. Don't listen to his metaphysics, Barbara. The place is
-the pleasure hunters, the military promotion hunters; and he is
-from his with a power equal to his own]. But you came and showed
-the surprise of the first shock mattered compared to the dread
-and horror of waiting for the second? That is how I feel in this

-UNDERSHAFT. Yes, the deadly seven. [Counting on his fingers]
-beside it: all the other dishonors are chivalry itself by
-comparison. Poverty blights whole cities; spreads horrible
-sight, sound or smell of it. What you call crime is nothing: a
-dirty people, ill fed, ill clothed people. They poison us morally
-cruelties for fear they should rise against us and drag us down

-Well, bring him to me here; and I will drag his soul back again

-LADY BRITOMART. Stop making speeches, Andrew. This is not the

-poverty and starvation. Your moralists are quite unscrupulous
-let me tell you this. Poverty and slavery have stood up for
-UNDERSHAFT. It is the final test of conviction, the only lever
-imagines it is governing its masters; but the ballot paper that
-really governs is the paper that has a bullet wrapped up in it.
-CUSINS. That is perhaps why, like most intelligent people, I
-inaugurate new epochs, abolish old orders and set up new. Is that
-historically true, Mr Learned Man, or is it not?
-CUSINS. It is historically true. I loathe having to admit it. I
-every possible way. Still, it is true. But it ought not to be
-spend your life saying ought, like the rest of our moralists?
-me. Whatever can blow men up can blow society up. The history of
-the world is the history of those who had courage enough to
-embrace this truth. Have you the courage to embrace it, Barbara?
-LADY BRITOMART. Barbara, I positively forbid you to listen to
-LADY BRITOMART [rising] Children: come home instantly. Andrew: I
-LADY BRITOMART. It is every use. It shows your disapprobation of
-LADY BRITOMART. I can see that you are going to disobey me.

-LOMAX. Delighted. Cholly is the usual ticket.

-have called everybody names. Come, Euripides! it is getting late;
-CUSINS. Understand this, you old demon--
-UNDERSHAFT. Pity! The scavenger of misery.
-Irishman. Do you love the Japanese? Do you love the Germans? Do
-you love the English?
-CUSINS. No. Every true Englishman detests the English. We are the
-wickedest nation on earth; and our success is a moral horror.
-UNDERSHAFT. That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?
-grip is slipping. Come! try your last weapon. Pity and love have
-broken in your hand: forgiveness is still left.
-CUSINS. No: forgiveness is a beggar's refuge. I am with you
-LADY BRITOMART. And who is that, pray?
-UNDERSHAFT. My bravest enemy. That is the man who keeps me up to

-All this mass of business will be Greek to you.
-STEPHEN. Well, I just want to say this before I leave you to

-myself that the business is one of the highest character and a

-CUSINS. It is not the sale of my soul that troubles me: I have

-What I am now selling it for is neither money nor position nor

-CUSINS. I think all power is spiritual: these cannons will not go

+It is after dinner on a January night, in the library in
+comfortable settee is in the middle of the room, upholstered in
+dark leather. A person sitting on it [it is vacant at present]
+would have, on his right, Lady Britomart's writing table, with
+on his left; the door behind him on Lady Britomart's side; and a
+window with a window seat directly on his left. Near the window
+is an armchair.
+Lady Britomart is a woman of fifty or thereabouts, well dressed
+Her son, Stephen, comes in. He is a gravely correct young man
+his mother, from childish habit and bachelor shyness rather than
+Stephen submissively walks to the settee and sits down. He takes
+Speaker]. Now! [She finishes her writing; rises; and comes to the
+the settee]. Sit down. [He sits down and fingers his tie
+nervously]. Don't fiddle with your tie, Stephen: there is nothing
+STEPHEN. I beg your pardon. [He fiddles with his watch chain
+speak to you very seriously, Stephen. I wish you would let that
+STEPHEN [hastily relinquishing the chain] Have I done anything to
+LADY BRITOMART [astonished] Nonsense! [With some remorse] My poor
+STEPHEN. What is it, then, mother? You are making me very uneasy.
+LADY BRITOMART. Don't repeat my words, please: It is a most
+affairs any longer. You must advise me: you must assume the
+your time most scandalously. Well, advise me.
+know is so painful--it is so impossible to mention some things to
+for Sarah. Charles Lomax will be a millionaire at 35. But that is
+ten years ahead; and in the meantime his trustees cannot under
+the terms of his father's will allow him more than 800 pounds a
+STEPHEN. But the will says also that if he increases his income
+by his own exertions, they may double the increase.
+decrease his income than to increase it. Sarah will have to find
+Army; discharges her maid; lives on a pound a week; and walks in
+the street, and who pretends to be a Salvationist, and actually
+were engaged. Cusins is a very nice fellow, certainly: nobody
+thank Heaven, is not a pig-headed Tory one. We are Whigs, and
+believe in liberty. Let snobbish people say what they please:
+STEPHEN. Of course I was thinking only of his income. However, he
+is not likely to be extravagant.
+that as well as I do. [Stephen closes his lips and is silent].
+STEPHEN. I am not sulking, mother. What has all this got to do
+LADY BRITOMART. My dear Stephen: where is the money to come from?
+It is easy enough for you and the other children to live on my
+families in four separate houses. You know how poor my father is:
+can do nothing for us: he says, naturally enough, that it is
+man who is rolling in money. You see, Stephen, your father must
+be fabulously wealthy, because there is always a war going on
+Undershaft ten inch! the Undershaft disappearing rampart gun! the
+Lazarus, Death and Destruction Dealers: address, Christendom and
+LADY BRITOMART. It is not only the cannons, but the war loans
+their thumbs. That is why your father is able to behave as he
+does. He is above the law. Do you think Bismarck or Gladstone or
+Disraeli could have openly defied every social and moral
+LADY BRITOMART. Not break the law! He is always breaking the law.
+He broke the law when he was born: his parents were not married.
+STEPHEN. He married without letting you know this!
+LADY BRITOMART [rather taken aback by this inference] Oh no. To
+foundling himself: he wanted to disinherit you for another
+LADY BRITOMART. Don't stammer, Stephen. Speak distinctly.
+STEPHEN. But this is so frightful to me, mother. To have to speak
+you are still so childish that you must make it worse by a
+display of embarrassment. It is only in the middle classes,
+class, we have to decide what is to be done with wicked people;
+and nothing should disturb our self possession. Now ask your
+LADY BRITOMART. Treat you as a child! What do you mean? It is
+alone for once, and tell me about this horrible business of my
+kind. I never dreamt of such a thing. This is what comes of
+and listen to me patiently. The Undershafts are descended from a
+foundling in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft in the city.
+That was long ago, in the reign of James the First. Well, this
+my father remonstrated, Andrew actually told him to his face that
+history tells us of only two successful institutions: one the
+their successors. Such rubbish! The Stevenages are as good as the
+really cannot bear an immoral man. I am not a Pharisee, I hope;
+and I should not have minded his merely doing wrong things: we
+one doesn't mind men practising immorality so long as they own
+forgive Andrew for preaching immorality while he practised
+ways. Children did not dislike him; and he took advantage of it
+unmanageable. I did not dislike him myself: very far from it; but
+nothing can bridge over moral disagreement.
+STEPHEN. All this simply bewilders me, mother. People may differ
+they differ about right and wrong? Right is right; and wrong is
+wrong; and if a man cannot distinguish them properly, he is
+LADY BRITOMART [touched] That's my own boy [she pats his cheek]!
+understand the situation, what do you advise me to do?
+take a farthing of his money.
+STEPHEN [bitterly] We are utterly dependent on him and his
+LADY BRITOMART. Certainly not: the money is settled. But he
+provided it. So you see it is not a question of taking money from
+him or not: it is simply a question of how much. I don't want any
+LADY BRITOMART. But Sarah does; and Barbara does. That is,
+put my pride in my pocket and ask for it, I suppose. That is your
+advice, Stephen, is it not?
+well, Stephen: It shall be as you wish. You will be glad to know
+is necessary that he should pay us a visit, don't you?
+without his money.
+your father to come this evening. [Stephen bounds from his seat]
+father is coming here to-night--that he may be here at any
+rises]. Ring the bell, please. [Stephen goes to the smaller
+writing table; presses a button on it; and sits at it with his
+elbows on the table and his head in his hands, outwitted and
+overwhelmed]. It is ten minutes to nine yet; and I have to
+case he should cherish any delusions as to their being capable of
+behind the settee to speak to him]. Morrison: go up to the

+authority. [He rises and tries to recover some vestige of these
+Charles Lomax and Adolphus Cusins. Sarah is slender, bored, and
+mundane. Barbara is robuster, jollier, much more energetic. Sarah
+is fashionably dressed: Barbara is in Salvation Army uniform.
+Lomax, a young man about town, is like many other young men about
+town. He is affected with a frivolous sense of humor which
+imperfectly suppressed laughter. Cusins is a spectacled student,
+of Lomax's complaint. His sense of humor is intellectual and
+subtle, and is complicated by an appalling temper. The lifelong
+set up a chronic strain which has visibly wrecked his constitution.
+He is a most implacable, determined, tenacious, intolerant person
+actually is--considerate, gentle, explanatory, even mild and
+coarseness. By the operation of some instinct which is not merciful
+enough to blind him with the illusions of love, he is obstinately
+resist Lady Britomart's arrangements to that end.
+BARBARA. It's all right, mother. Cholly is quite correct
+SARAH [calling] Come in, Cholly. [Lomax enters, controlling his
+Adolphus. I am surprised at you, though I expected nothing better
+LADY BRITOMART. Be quiet, Charles. Now listen to me, children.
+Your father is coming here this evening. [General stupefaction].
+LADY BRITOMART. Of course I am serious. It is on your account,
+LADY BRITOMART [frigidly] What do you wish to convey, Charles?
+LOMAX. Well, you must admit that this is a bit thick.
+remarks into reputable English for us?
+LADY BRITOMART [crushingly] Thank you. Have I your permission,
+SARAH. Do you mean that he is coming regularly to live here?
+LADY BRITOMART. Certainly not. The spare room is ready for him if
+result is, you never mean anything. And now please attend to me,
+seen his children since they were babies, he will form his
+to-night, and that therefore you wish us all to be particularly
+recollection is perfectly correct. It is most important that you
+opposite corners and giggle and whisper while I am speaking to
+Morrison, pale and dismayed, breaks into the room in unconcealed
+disorder.
+LOMAX. Does Morrison know who he is?
+LADY BRITOMART. Of course. Morrison has always been with us.
+LADY BRITOMART. Is this a moment to get on my nerves, Charles,
+LOMAX. But this is something out of the ordinary, really--
+Andrew Undershaft comes in. All rise. Lady Britomart meets him in
+Andrew is, on the surface, a stoutish, easygoing elderly man,
+character. But he has a watchful, deliberate, waiting, listening
+in his capacious chest and long head. His gentleness is partly
+that of a strong man who has learnt by experience that his
+carefully, and partly the mellowness of age and success. He is
+also a little shy in his present very delicate situation.
+LADY BRITOMART [promptly] Rubbish! This is your family.
+UNDERSHAFT [surprised] Is it so large? I am sorry to say my
+memory is failing very badly in some things. [He offers his hand
+LOMAX [jerkily shaking his hand] Ahdedoo.
+Am I making any ridiculous mistake? I may as well confess: I
+LADY BRITOMART [decisively] Andrew: you are talking nonsense. Of
+LADY BRITOMART. That is Charles Lomax, who is engaged to Sarah.
+LADY BRITOMART. This is Stephen.
+in his] How are you, my young friend? [To Lady Britomart] He is
+CUSINS. You flatter me, Mr Undershaft. My name is Cusins: engaged
+to Barbara. [Very explicitly] That is Major Barbara Undershaft,
+of the Salvation Army. That is Sarah, your second daughter. This
+is Stephen Undershaft, your son.
+so precisely. [Turning to Sarah] Barbara, my dear--
+Barbara] Barbara--I am right this time, I hope.
+brings his chair forward on her left. Barbara and Stephen resume
+their seats. Lomax gives his chair to Sarah and goes for
+UNDERSHAFT [accepting the chair] That is not what embarrasses me,
+Mr Lomax. My difficulty is that if I play the part of a father, I
+the part of a discreet stranger, I may appear a callous father.
+LADY BRITOMART. There is no need for you to play any part at all,
+UNDERSHAFT [submissively] Yes, my dear: I daresay that will be
+CUSINS. Let me advise you to study Greek, Mr Undershaft. Greek
+them know anything else; but their position is unchallengeable.

+LADY BRITOMART. It is not my doing, Andrew. Barbara is old enough
+to take her own way. She has no father to advise her.
