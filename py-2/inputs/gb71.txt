His name was Hrlec Brey. He was a big man, and he moved slowly as if he
had all the time in the world.

And he had. He had all the time--years and years behind him, years and
years ahead. And the world was his, its length and breadth, its skies
and seas, the solitude of night, the loneliness of day.

He was eating dinner when the knowledge smashed across his mind:
_Tonight I am going to die._

He put down his leg of _ayala_ and stared blankly at the plank
wall across the room. That he was going to die did not disturb him.
That he knew about it did. It was not whimsy that had crossed his
mind. He was not given to idle speculation. It was as if a sense of
precognition had suddenly developed in his intellect. It was a strange,
irrevocable certainty.

His gaze fell on the half-eaten leg of _ayala_, and he shrugged. A
crime to let it go to waste, impending death or not. He picked it up,
moved his jaw slowly around the bone. So I'm going to die. Tomorrow
I'll be free. Then his eyes hardened and his teeth tore savagely at the
last bite of meat. _I haven't evolved._

Moving slowly because the pains had been with him all day--he called
them "pains" because there seemed no better word--he washed off the
table and went out to the front porch of his small farmhouse on
Ophiuchus VI to sit in the twilight and smoke his pipe. He was a man of
fifty Earth years, whom age had weathered and work had bent, and the
strongest thing about him was his will. He had willed to remain sane in
his solitary world after the tragedy so many years before, and he had
made it. Just made it. He did not even talk to himself.

He settled his bones in the log chair and planted his feet comfortably
on the railing. He had willed that he could gaze upon this evening
scene and believe it to be Earth. Often he had succeeded. The same
colors in the twilight, though it lasted seven hours. A sky with a
Milky Way, without a moon. Gravity that made him always just a little
tired. Forests and mountains and sea, beauty and peace. And Sol, a
pinpoint two thousand light-years off, with no chance of ever getting
back.

A living hell.

He lit his pipe, filled with a native weed he'd gotten used to. There
was no savor in a pipeful now, with bitterness eating at him. How could
he spend his last night? There was only one way. The same as any other
of the thousand nights before.

When he died, the last of his race would disappear from the face of
Asmarad, sixth planet of the sun Ophiuchus. He was of Earth. Oh, Mother
of Comforts, Earth, in the New Galactic Age! It was a long way from the
barbarian Old Atomic, almost at the fringe of prehistory. As always,
when he remembered his heritage from the distant home that had given
him birth, his great bowed shoulders straightened and some of the old
fire came back into his eyes.

Though he did not often allow himself to think of the past, his
thoughts went back--how many years ago, Earth time?--to the day of
triumph, when Brey's ship had put down a mile away by the shore of a
salt sea. A thousand men and women with the purpose of carving out
from untrodden paths the beginnings of a mighty civilization. To make
a little Earth of Asmarad as had been done on a thousand other worlds
across the galaxy--and perhaps by now, beyond.

A thousand other worlds--and here they had failed. No, they had not
quite failed. Not yet. Not with Brey alive. Not tonight. Tomorrow.

Suddenly restless, he rose painfully and walked down the gravel path to
his flower garden. He gazed at the brilliant multicolored web-things
native to the region, but the sight for once gave him no pleasure. The
restlessness grew stronger. It became an urgency, at once compelling
and disturbing. Urgency to do something before he died. Something
as important as drawing his next breath. Yet what could possibly be
important to Hrlec Brey, landbound Senior Captain of the Space Fleet,
the only Earthman left on Asmarad, on the evening of his death?

He looked from the flower garden across the plowed fields of his farm
and then beyond, into the broad valley that ended against the blue haze
of mountains a hundred miles away. For years the shimmering blue haze
had symbolized the impassable wall between him and Earth. He was hemmed
in, without machinery to transport himself, without weapons except for
a bow and arrow he had made himself.

He heard, far away, two _trocoids_ thrashing aimlessly
among the trees, their shrill staccato a lonely yet comforting
sound. The animals, too, were almost like Earth animals. They
reproduced by fission, like some of the lower forms of life on
Earth. The _trocoid_ was like an oversized wasp. The murderous
_ithycyphos_ was like a razorback horse, with a cry like a woman
under torture. The meat-rich _ayala_ made him think of landbound
seals. There were other animals, too, other birds, and fish in the
nearby sea.

Still the urgency beat at him and, without quite knowing why, he began
to walk across the plowed field to the enclosure where he kept a few
_ayala_ to fatten. My animals might be gone, he thought anxiously,
my supply of meat might fail. _Hurry!_ his mind told him.
_Hurry, hurry!_ His steps quickened.

       *       *       *       *       *

Now the long twilight deepened and night drifted slowly in from the
far blue haze. Always when the slow night of Asmarad began to fall,
Brey felt anew the soul-wrenching loneliness. This was a twilight made
for the old pleasures that over the centuries had never changed. For
gathering by the campfire and singing the old songs, for the spice of
well-cooked meat, for whispers in the dark and strolls through the
forest, for a woman's lips on yours. And back on Earth, under the
shadows of the spaceships ready to hurtle the light-years across the
galaxy, there was laughter on the lips of man, and their hearts held
room for love.

With aching heart he remembered Ansa. A wisp of a girl she had been,
and the first of the women to die--only a month after their landing.
How long would they have been married now, had she lived? In this
timeless world, it was his one regret that he could never know exactly.
He could never celebrate their would-have-been anniversary. The day was
different in length, as were the years. And he had no watch to keep
track of the hours. He could never count the years she had been gone.
But he knew they were many. Oh, how well he knew!

He began to walk faster, and then he began to trot, and then he broke
into an urgent, lumbering run, stumbling across the even furrows of the
potato-like _terna_ he had planted.

And then an internal grinding shock of terrible power slammed him to
the ground.

He was not knocked unconscious, but lay on his face on the rich red
dirt, his mind shocked into stupor. At length he shook his head, pushed
heavily up with his hands and climbed to shaky feet. He leaned against
the logs of the enclosure, gathering strength. The pains were stronger
now, the periodic nameless writhings inside him. Terror touched his
mind, not at the pains themselves but at their pattern, over the
months. Pain that was not quite pain, sensations without an Earth name.
They had bothered him now and then, though lately they had come more
often. And this was the most terrible of all.

What's been happening inside me all this time? Must be a disease. A
native disease. And no doctors, no medicine left, no hospital. And no
pretty nurse to hold my hand!

It's beginning, he thought. Death.

He had seen much of death since coming to Asmarad. Too much. First he
had seen the babies born dead, the babies conceived on the way. No
woman ever became pregnant on Asmarad. Nobody ever knew why. And then
he had seen all the women die. Sudden deaths, painless and unexplained.
The doctors could only suggest that the female physiology, complex and
delicate as it was, could not adapt even to the slight changes on
Asmarad. But the doctors never really knew.

Their purpose on Asmarad defeated, the men planned to return to Earth.
And then Brey had seen the atomic explosion that had wrecked the ship
and the entire community, killing them all. All but Brey.

And no ship was due from Earth for a hundred years.

My own death, Brey thought dully, wiping sweat from his face, will be
different. Not silent and painless and mercifully quick.

He heard screaming in the distance and his blood chilled. The
_ithycyphos_ were near. Perhaps they would approach his farm. He
would be ready if they did. Feeling stronger now, he walked to the gate
to enter the enclosure.

The gate was open.

       *       *       *       *       *

At first shock caught his breath, but upon examining the gate, he saw
the latch had broken. He looked sharply into the enclosure for his six
_ayala_. He counted only five. One had wandered off. No--there,
far inside the enclosure, two intermediate-sized _ayala_,
fissioned from the body of the other adult, were flopping about in the
tall grass.

He grunted with satisfaction. If the others had wandered off, it would
be days before he could find them, or catch others. He whistled and the
five adults shambled over on nimble fins. He knew he must slaughter
some of them. He picked the three fattest.

What instinct led me over here? How could I possibly have known my meat
supply might be lost?

Followed by the docile _ayala_, he hurried back to his farmhouse,
herded them inside and closed the door. His bow and arrow would be a
match for the _ithycyphos_, but some instinct told him he needed
even more protection. From the adjacent woodshed he got tools and
lengths of stout planking and spent half an hour carefully barricading
the windows. I've never done that in years. Why now, when I'm going to
die?

Finished nailing crisscross planking to the two windows, he tested
the barricade thoroughly for strength. Satisfied, he slaughtered the
_ayala_, cut up their meat and packed it in the brine vat. (Enough
for a month. But why did I slaughter them now? And why three? Why not
more? Or less?)

The screaming sounded again, still far across the valley. He knew he
must lay in more food. He had meat now, but his stock of _terna_
was low. There were five hours of twilight left, time enough to fill
his bin.

He was busy for three hours digging _terna_, though three times
more he was knocked flat by the terrible shocks, and the pains were
with him all the time. His hands had begun to shake, and his eyes would
blur and dim and he would have to rest a moment before he could see
clearly again. He had begun to feel weaker. He knew the end was not far
off.

As he worked, his mind wandered back again to his years with the Space
Fleet, to the other planets he'd seen where Earthmen had been able to
evolve. An old word, evolution, but in the New Galactic Age, a new
meaning. On Earth it had taken a billion years for the human body to
evolve into that of an intelligent biped. Now, on some of the more
alien planets which imposed severe conditions on the preservation
of human life, it took surprisingly less time to evolve in order to
meet these conditions. An adaptability existed in the genes that had
not been known before. Until it was discovered, colonization had
been restricted to a handful of planets whose conditions were nearly
identical to Earth's.

But the discovery of the faculty of adaptable evolution had opened
a thousand worlds to Earthmen. It took centuries on some planets to
evolve, slowly and painfully and with suitable protective measures,
only decades on others. It made Brey proud. Proud that the human body
was capable of so much. Proud that the inheritors of the galaxy were
not the _lilithae_ from the Ridge nor the degenerated mutations
from the Hercules cluster, but Earthmen.

Like those Earthmen on Thor of Beta Centaurus whose lungs had evolved
for breathing a methane atmosphere. Like those on Remus of Sirius whose
lobster-like bodies had evolved to withstand temperatures which reached
six hundred. Like those on Betelguese XXX, too far out from its sun for
heat and light, whose eyes had atrophied over the generations and now
were removed like appendices used to be removed on Earth, and whose
perceptions had evolved to meet the new conditions. Or on Jpidr of the
sun Deneb Algedi, where Earthmen's digestive systems had evolved to
eating the metallic lichens adhering to rocks, the only native form of
life. There were a billion Earthmen now on barren Jpidr.

And only one on Asmarad....

       *       *       *       *       *

Why didn't we evolve before we died? But even if we could, it would
have been too late. There were no women. Without a woman, his race must
perish.

He finished putting up his supplies, and went back to the front porch
to wait for the death that stalked him. He relit his pipe, his mind
refreshed, the sense of urgency almost gone. But suddenly fires seared
his body and he slumped back in his chair until the racking spasm
passed.

Wings whirred past the porch and the screech of a _trocoid_ beat
at his ears. He watched the furry creature land at the base of a tree
in front of his farmhouse. It waddled awkwardly toward a hole Brey had
not noticed before, dragging in its creepers a length of floccose weed,
its staple diet. The bird must have been boring out the hole the past
several days. As Brey watched, the bird began to close the hole in the
tree from inside, with chunks of bark and dirt and moss, cemented with
secretion.

Now it was black night at last and the _trocoid_ was for the
moment silent inside its tree and Brey felt the wall of silence
pressing in upon him.

_Ansa_, he thought dimly. _If only we had died together...._

New shocks erupted inside his body and a scream tore from his throat.
A new urgency made him scramble inside the farmhouse where he just had
time to close the door and slip planks into stays made for that purpose
before he fell writhing to the floor.

There came a moment of peace between the shocks. _I was thinking
of Ansa when it struck. Ansa? My wife. Funny, I can't seem to think.
Must be in a daze. I remember Ansa, all right. What was Ansa, anyhow?
I know. A woman. They look like Earthmen. Bipeds. I think they have
intellects. Must be non-human. Like the lilithae._

From the tree outside he heard the _trocoid's_ muffled
screeches. He knew it was the standard routine of the asexual bird
for fissioning--when an old _trocoid's_ instinct told it
that it was about to die, it found a breeding place safe from the
_ithycyphos_, supplied it with food, barricaded itself inside,
and then fissioned into two nearly-grown, mindless _trocoids_.
The food and the protection afforded by their parent would keep the
_trocoids_ alive till instinct took hold and they could break free
into the world outside.

Brey forgot about the _trocoid_ as his neck suddenly snapped
and it became impossible to breathe, and he felt his body being rent
asunder, as if something were trying to tear its way out of him.

And before he died, he had one bitter, final thought: _I deserve to
die. On Asmarad, we never evolved._

And after he died, the two naked humanoid creatures sprang to their
feet to stare mindlessly at one another.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
